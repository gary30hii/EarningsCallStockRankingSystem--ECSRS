At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today, Mr. Daniel Harris, you may begin.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me on the call is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee, and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Earlier this morning we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. For the fourth quarter, we generated $145 million in fee-related earnings and $237 million in distributable earnings with DE per common share of $0.64. For the year FRE was $520 million and DE per common share was $2.05, both up from 2019 levels. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. This quarter we are reporting our results under our new segment structure, which is more aligned with how we operate our business. All equity investment strategies are now captured in a single segment global private equity, that includes our former corporate private equity and real asset segments. All of our credit investment strategies remain in global credit and our investment solutions segment continues to house our portfolio management strategies As a reminder, we look forward to hosting our first Investor Day as a corporation on February 23 at 8:30 a.m. Registration is open and we do encourage you to pre-register if possible at ir.carlyle.com. At our upcoming Investor Day, our leadership team will discuss our corporate strategy and financial objectives as well as opportunities for each of our businesses. I'm sure many of your questions today could be tied to our longer-term outlook and topics we'd like to cover comprehensively at Investor Day and as such we may defer responding to these questions and address them at that time and in context with our broader plan. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you, Dan. 2020 was a year of growth and positive change for Carlyle, despite the challenging and complex environment. Our focus in 2021 is to build on our current momentum, and we look forward to providing more detail on our strategy for accelerating growth at our Investor Day in two weeks. Today, I'd like to focus on three points. First Carlyle delivered very strong results for shareholders in 2020. Second, our investment portfolio is in great shape. And third, our business model and organization proved extremely resilient and adaptable to the changing environment. Let me start by focusing on our 2020 results, which were strong across all metrics. We generated a record $520 million in fee-related earnings, with margins in excess of 30%. The substantial progress from just a few short years ago when FRE was less than half of this year's level. Continuing to grow FRE remains a primary strategic focus. Distributable earnings increased 18% in 2020, and we expect continued growth in earnings as our investment portfolios perform and mature. Our investment activity picked up sharply throughout the year. Despite the challenging environment, we exited the year with great momentum deploying $9 billion of capital in the fourth quarter alone, and $18 billion for the year. Our ability to consistently deploy in good times and bad demonstrates the value of our global platform and multi-asset class approach. We also accelerated our exit pace, realizing $7 billion for our fund investors in the fourth quarter and $21 billion for the year. And since the beginning of 2020 we've taken eight of our portfolio companies public and have over $17 billion of current value in public securities that when realized will generate proceeds for our LPs and earnings for our shareholders. And the final highlight, we raised $27.5 billion in new capital during the year with nearly 90% of the capital raised from our global credit and investment solutions segments. We will have much more to say about the trajectory and scale of our next fundraising cycle at Investor Day. Let me now move to some remarks on our investment portfolio which is diverse and balanced and in great shape. A few highlights, our private equity buyout funds appreciated 19% in aggregate in 2020. Our largest fully invested fund US Buyout 6 appreciated 46% in 2020 and our latest fully invested Asia Buyout fund was up 34%. Our global credit funds also performed extremely well despite significant volatility during the year. Our opportunistic credit fund appreciated 21% in 2020 and our structured credit strategy appreciated 16%, positioning both strategies for future growth. When combined across the firm, our strong performance drove our net accrued carry balance up 36% in 2020 to a record $2.3 billion, which positions us very well for a substantial step-up in realized performance revenue over the next few years. The last point I want to make is on the resiliency of our business model and adaptability of our firm. Nearly all just about 98% of our capital is committed to us for the long term, in many cases, 10 years or more. These fund structures provide us with predictable and stable management fees regardless of market volatility. While the remote environment last year was personally challenging for each of us, our people and platform adapted rapidly during the year and our business operations were virtually unaffected by COVID. Our global investing platform pivoted quickly to operate in the new environment. Our investment teams effectively sourced and close new deals, carefully monitor our portfolio and completed IPOs and exits. We found new investment opportunities in regions like India and China and pivoted to private equity growth, particularly in healthcare and technology. And we provided flexible credit solutions to sponsors and corporates despite the volatile environment. At the same time, we spent countless hours with our limited partners developing a new cadence that enabled us to forge in deeper relationships with them despite not meeting in person and raised over $27 billion in a year when we weren't in the market with our flagship global private equity funds. 2020 has demonstrated our resiliency and ability to adapt, and we find ourselves well-positioned to manage through the challenges ahead to deal with the continued impact of COVID on economies, markets and our portfolios. Most importantly, we remain focused on the health and safety of our people and we owe our success in 2020 to their dedication, hard work and expertise. I want to say a sincere thank you to each and every one of them for their extraordinary efforts last year. Let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser to go through our results, and then I'll come back with some final thoughts. Curt?\nCurt Buser: Thank you, Kew, and good morning. We performed well in 2020 despite the pandemic and economic volatility throughout the year. We generated $762 million in distributable earnings, our best year since 2015 and DE per share of $2.05 for the year increased 20% over 2019. Before digging into our financial results, I'd like to touch on three items. First, our outlook for 2021 fee-related earnings and realized performance revenues. Second, the trajectory of our effective DE tax rate. And third, stock-based compensation expense and equity awards. First, fee-related earnings were $520 million in 2020 and excluding $30 million in cost recoveries during the first quarter adjusted FRE of $490 million, increased more than 8% year-over-year despite not raising new capital for any of our global private equity flagship funds. FRE margin on the adjusted basis was 30%, up nearly 200 basis points relative to 28% in 2019. For the year, global credit fee-related earnings of $99 million, more than doubled the 2019 level. While investment solutions FRE of $37 million was also more than double the prior year. In both cases, top line growth drove the majority of the year-over-year increase and margins expanded substantially in both segments. Looking at 2021, we expect realized performance revenues to continue to grow and we expect to produce similar to slightly higher FRE compared to adjusted 2020 results. Consolidated top line management fee revenues should modestly increase with more noticeable growth in investment solutions and global credit more than offsetting some downward fee pressure in global private equity as portfolio realizations increase. Global private equity will see growth in management fees and in FRE when our next multiyear fundraising cycle begins for our large flagship funds, which we do not expect to meaningfully affect our 2021 FRE results. Our net accrued carry of $2.3 billion is now 18% higher than its previous peak balance and the remaining fair value invested in our carry funds of $95 billion is 50% greater than its average balance during the period of 2012 to 2017 when our net realized performance revenues averaged over $600 million annually. With our funds performing well and assuming no material surprises in the capital markets, we expect realized performance revenues to gradually increase in 2021 and then in the years thereafter surpassed our prior annual averages. Regarding our outlook on our DE tax rate; in our first year as a full corporate taxpayer, our effective DE tax rate was 5%. The relatively low rate benefited from the utilization of legacy net operating loss carry-forwards in addition to the basis step-ups and tax amortization arising from our corporate conversion. For 2021, we expect our effective DE tax rate will increase to the mid-teens as we fully utilize the remaining legacy NOLs early in the year. Thereafter the effective rate is likely to continue to increase annually before settling in the low 20s in later years. Of course, this outlook is based on current tax laws and should changes arise in any jurisdiction, our expectations for effective tax rates may change as well. Moving on, stock-based compensation expense was $29 million in the fourth quarter and $117 million for the year, down 23% from $151 million in 2019. The decline owes [ph] to the positive impact of granting fewer year-end stock awards than in previous years, as well as the departure of certain senior executives during the year. As part of this year's compensation cycle, we granted long-term strategic equity awards to a small number of our most senior executives, which are predominantly tied to achieving milestones in our strategic plan. As a result, we expect our equity-based compensation expense to increase to amounts comparable to 2019. Let's shift to a broader discussion of our results. Overall, we had an active year and have great momentum entering 2021. As Kew noted earlier, we raised $27.5 billion in new capital in 2020 with both global credit and investment solutions posting a record fundraising years. Global credit surpassed its previous record by nearly 50% and investment solutions raise more than twice as much as any prior year. During the fourth quarter, investment solutions had a final closing on its $9 billion AlpInvest Secondaries program which round up nearly 40% larger than its predecessor and its new co-investment strategy is now raising capital. In global credit, we had an initial closing on our second opportunistic credit fund, and activity in several platform-wide strategies both segments are positioned well for future growth. Fund performance was particularly strong. The fourth quarter carry fund appreciation of 11% in corporate private equity, 3% in real estate, 3% in natural resources, 7% in global credit carry funds and 7% in investment solutions. Fee-related earnings in the fourth quarter were $145 million with a 34% margin, up from $108 million at a 26% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the upside largely owing to higher total fee revenue and lower G&A expenses. Fee revenues for the fourth quarter of $429 million, increased 5% from last year, largely driven by higher transaction fees of $21 million, nearly double a year ago and up from virtually zero in Q3 2020. During the fourth quarter, we also activated fees on our new Japan Buyout Fund, increasing global private equity management fees from Q3. Fee earning assets under management was $170 billion, up 3% for the quarter and 6% over last year with a 28% increase in investment solutions and then an 11% increase in global credit, both driven by strong fundraising offsetting a modest decline for global private equity, as we continue to realize proceeds for our fund investors. Shifting to expenses, cash compensation was $202 million for the fourth quarter and $822 million for the full year, 4% higher than 2019. And we continue to be disciplined on managing compensation expense. G&A expense was $73 million in the fourth quarter, down from $95 million a year ago. For the year, G&A of $241 million declined 27% year-over-year, owing to lower travel expenditures as well as a $30 million litigation cost recovery in the first quarter. G&A expense should increase in 2021 due to a normalization in both items but we believe G&A expenses are likely to remain below prior peak levels as we capitalize on learnings over the past year. Net realized performance revenues were $87 million in the fourth quarter and for the year increased 50% from 2019. The majority of realized performance revenues this quarter was from our six US Buyout fund with carry from our Real Estate funds making up most of the remainder. In sum, we continue to be pleased with the durability and sustainability of our fee earnings and we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunity for growing DE over the coming years. We look forward to speaking with you all in a few weeks when we will go into more detail on our growth plan. With that, let me turn it back over to Kew for some final thoughts.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you, Curt. We have worked hard over the past few years and our results this year reflect the momentum we have built. We're proud of the performance we delivered on behalf of our limited partners and our shareholders in 2020. And we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We look forward to speaking with all of you in more detail on February 23rd. And let me now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good Morning, Kew, Curt. Hope you are both doing well\nKewsong Lee: Hey. Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we wanted to start with the impressive fundraising results from the solutions business, which now almost has $60 billion of AUM. Could you provide us an update of how you view the addressable market, the competitive landscape and also the growth trajectory for your secondaries and co-investment businesses across both AlpInvest and Metropolitan\nCurt Buser: Craig, let me start. So in global credit, it was a very good year, nearly $10 billion of capital raised, good growth across the platform and it's really nicely disbursed in terms of the various components of the business and including even the CLO business. And in AlpInvest $14 billion of fundraising this year, a record year for fundraising, its AUM has been growing nicely. And the thing to also remember then in the case of AlpInvestis the burn off that we had in a lot of AUM in early years is really from some of the two major investors or shareholders in that business prior to our ownership. And so really the growth in AUM is even bigger than what you kind of see by looking at the aggregate numbers because you got to take into account that historical run-off. The team has really done a nice job of repositioning the industrial base across that whole platform and that secondaries program was $9 billion now in terms of the total program size, it didn't turn on fees really until the fourth quarter and so that should be a nice driver of fee revenue growth for that next year. And then as you think about the co-investment program, they're not just in raising their next kind of generation of that and that will be additive to next year as well; so really well-positioned for continued growth.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Craig, it's Kew. Taking a step back, if you think about it. Clearly, the private capital markets have really grown and are huge and so it shouldn't surprise all of us that large LPs and small LPs are a need of what I would call portfolio management solutions as they optimize risk and allocation to the asset class. And the way they do that is by first focusing on secondaries, second, trying to add co-investment opportunities, and third, obviously, in a diversified way they're looking for potentially ways to pick up interesting new GP commitments, but in a more diversified way. And AlpInvest is a platform that lets them do that. And so this whole area of alternatives I think is just going to continue to grow on the heels of the fact that the broader industry is growing. So that's a big picture number one. Number two, it used to be that these types of solutions were very bespoke in the past but, increasingly, we're seeing large carry over from our existing LP base as we try to minimize or add to deployment, manage risk, work on co-investment strategies, etcetera And so about 40% of the LPs in solutions I believe are also LPs in our existing global private equity and global credit franchise. So there is a huge cross-sell, but also an introduction to all of Carlyle, which solutions offers us to be able to introduce to our LP base. And then, finally -- and we're going to get into this in Investor Day, the performance of these strategies has been terrific and we're going to -- we'll show you more of that in two weeks, so please be patient. But that performance is the underlying driver for why we believe in these three very focused strategies, secondaries, co investments and primary fund to funds, we see real growth opportunity ahead of us in solutions.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Kew, thank you for the comprehensive response\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nDean Stephan : Hey, good morning. This is Dean Stephan on for Mike Carrier. Given the active deployment levels in the fourth quarter, can you just update us on the deployment outlook heading into '21, maybe what the pipeline is looking like and how quickly the $13 billion in pending fee earning AUM can potentially be invested or activated moving forward? Thanks.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Dean, it's Kew here. I mean, look, we're about as busy as we've ever been, our pipelines are really full. And if there is one thing last year has taught all of us, it's that with change comes also lots of opportunity. Now the good news is our platform, be it regionally, be it different asset classes, be it different investment strategies, be it different investment sectors. We're well-positioned to go to where the opportunities are and be one step ahead. Valuation levels certainly very high, no doubt about it, but also the ability for us to add value, work with our teams to grow these businesses and help them, is also high. So that's the challenge, which is to keep finding these deals. And I think last year was a good indication of the way this platform can pivot, if there's volatility, we see opportunities in credit. If traditional buyouts get way too expensive, we see ways to grow in private equity growth investing, if certain western economy markets are a little bit more less active we saw a lots of activity in the Far East in India and in China. So our pipelines are very busy, valuation levels make it very difficult, but our platform is very well positioned I believe to keep finding great opportunities and create value.\nCurt Buser: And just adding on the $13 billion -- a little over $13 billion of pending fee earning AUM is relatively evenly spread across the three segments, a little bit larger in global credit and investment solutions than in global private equity and a lot of that is really tied to as the funds either turn on as we complete fundraising or as we invest capital. And so both providing really good FRE ramps, particularly in global credit and investment solutions.\nDean Stephan : Got it. Thanks, guys.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Dean.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wondered, maybe focus on the capital management a little bit. So just want to maybe refresh on, as you look forward particularly with realizations ramping, you have the stable quarterly dividend. So how should we think of dividend growth from here and where does -- how do you think of down the road buybacks versus reinvesting it in back in the business, and how do you think of that trade-off [ph]?\nCurt Buser: Robert, hey, thank you for that question. Managing capital to really drive the business is obviously our core priority, making sure that that capital really is driving growth in earnings and growth in the business. And so making sure that we have capital to invest in our funds, new initiatives available for strategic growth initiatives, and then, etcetera is always a priority for us. But cornerstone to everything we do is making sure that we maintain our fixed dividend. And looking at how we will plan to grow that is we have indicated in the past is really as FRE grows, that's how we will grow our fixed dividend. So Yes, I would not expect anything near term because I already have indicated a kind of FRE will be similar to this past year, or slightly up, but when we are really kind of well-positioned for growth in FRE because that way we can underpin that six businesses what we want to do. With respect to dilution management, what we have said before is we want to be around 1% in terms of dilution. We're cautious with our use of capital and buybacks really in 2020 given the pandemic and all the related uncertainties. But you can see us kind of being active to think through how to make sure we manage that dilution both through equity grants as well as through buybacks.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question, and good morning. So maybe one for Curt; could you sort of go back to your guidance on the realization outlook for 2021 and I just sort of wondering the jump off point, is it the full-year '20 as we look to 21? Is it the pacing for the fourth quarter and growing off there? And then, maybe the interplay of how that will tie to in terms of the comp ratio against those revenues? Thank you\nCurt Buser: Bill, thanks for your question, and good morning. Yes, so as we talk about -- I presume you're talking about net realized performance revenues, so our net carry just to level set, we had $246 million of realized carry this past year, it was up about 50% from the prior year, but well below our average that we ran between 2012 to 2017 of over $600 million a year. We're clearly positioned to surpass $600 million, the wealthy [ph] accrued carry remaining fair value in the ground. But that's not going to occur in 2021 outlook. Capital markets could do something and we could exceed expectations to the high, but we could also miss and predicting carry is always really hard to predict with precision. What I said in my remarks in particular, was expect a gradual increase and things to watch is, so just in the past year, as we said Carlyle Partners VI turned on carry in Q3. We also said that we weren't taking carry at a full 20% rate, which was true through all of 202, we did not take carry on CP VI at the full rate. And if you look at where the fund is, it's nicely set up. So there is room to take it at a higher rate on CP VI going forward. More importantly though, there are many other funds that have not yet turned on carry that are in accrued carry. Asia buyout IV is a good example, Japan III is a good example. And so as those funds also get to positions where we're comfortable from a fallback management perspective and you know we're careful on that will signal to you as, as the bigger funds turn on, so that you will kind of know kind of what that trajectory is but that's also kind of thinking gradual increase does not all of that will hit on right away. Hopefully, that gives you some color, Bill.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Turning to insurance; can you give us an update on Fortitude and maybe your priorities for your insurance operations? And then what are the next steps for insurance for Carlyle?\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Ken, it's Kew. Let me give you a little bit of color as of the here and now. But I'd ask that everyone to be patient, because we will talk a bit more about this at our Investor Day. I mean, look, we're very pleased with our Fortitude is right now. Its adjusted book value is doing great, its annualized ROE right now is closer to the mid-teens and the liabilities are performing just in line with our expectations. It's got excess capital. More importantly, we have stood it up fully, it is carved out and it is ready to start scaling via reinsurance and/or acquisition. In terms of rotation, my understanding is of about $4.7 billion have already been rotated over to Carlyle in terms of assets under management, and this is on a track towards $6 billion, which we think will hit over the next year or so. Now, what's more important to understand is that rotation that's occurred is very broad across our platform. I think it's close to 25 funds have received the semi-permanent type of capital investment that Fortitude represents into our funds and it's across all three segments, global private equity, global credit and investment solutions. So the platform itself is very much on-track. We feel very good about it. And so the right question now is, okay, where do we go from here? And with respect to that, I'm going to ask that you be patient and wait because we want to talk about this a little bit more comprehensively at Investor Day in a couple of weeks.\nKen Worthington: Great. Well, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just coming back to some of the commentary on your multi-year view on the carry sort of pick-up, if you will. I think if we look back at the 2011 to 2017 realization cycle, you guys seem to turn over the carry receivable balance of that every two years or so. So call it like a 50% pull-through or monetization of the receivable in a given year over that cycle. I guess is there anything different today with your fund line up and fund performance that could result, any different outcome than a 50% pull-through rate or so, as we look out over the next couple of years and what would you say are the top, if any limiting factors that would prevent you from hitting to say that 50% pull through that you've done in the past from hitting that over the next couple of years.\nCurt Buser: Mike, it's Curt. Really good analysis in terms of how to look at that and that's exactly right in terms of what happened back in 2012 to 2017 on average. But if you look at the past couple of years, that's not held through in the past couple of years. And a lot of that is making sure that the portfolio has been mature enough. And we're not yet at that place where it is fully mature to make that same kind of conclusion with respect to '21. I'll speak more to the outer years at our Investor Day in two weeks. But right now, I would be cautious about applying the same math to '21.\nMichael Cyprys: Is that math fair to apply to next couple of years beyond 2021 would you say or is there anything different with the portfolio today that could result in a different outcome than that sort of 50% roughly?\nCurt Buser: Yes. I think, you always have to be a little careful in that math only because a lot of it has to do with makeup at any point in time. And I would say it's more a correlation as opposed to causality but over long terms in good markets and capital markets are making sure that know all of the big buyout funds are producing carry, that's where it gets a little bit more comfortable.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Great, thanks. Perhaps one just on global credit, fundraising obviously has been getting stronger and clearly momentum building in that segment. But perhaps you can give us a sense of what products are seeing the most traction and even what the pipeline for new solutions might look like. Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Sure, Gerry, it's Kew here. And I think you got [ph] to be bored of hearing this from me, this is one area, we're going to do a deep dive on in two weeks. The highlights though as we sit here today, you're right, there is great momentum in the global credit segment, it's a broad platform as you know. Our credit opportunity strategy is doing quite well. We're seeing, and all of you are seeing this, the CLO market is coming back, certainly, a pickup in activity level from last year and we are projecting to see continued strengthening in that market. With respect to some of the initiatives we have in the market today, I don't want to comment on them, because they are fundraising, but we do have global infrastructure credit for instance in the market raising funds. And this is a segment which is very scalable given what we have set up and we're also seeing real traction with respect to platform-wide special accounts and strategic accounts that can be on any one singular account quite large. So let me hold there and just say, we're pleased with the platform, the progress, the -- look, the dropdown in growth directly into earnings, but more to come in two weeks.\nGerry O'Hara: Fair enough. Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from you Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks. You kicked my interest a little bit. Curt, you mentioned when you're talking about the equity grants that there -- grants, it's obviously senior people and that's quite long-term milestones. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about the long-term milestones that they're tied to. I know they are aligned with the same things investors are looking for, but just any specifics there, I think people find interesting?\nCurt Buser: Glenn, hey, thanks for your question. And as I said, these grants are mostly to the most senior people in the firm that can really kind of drive our FRE and our earnings results. They are largely -- or predominantly performance testing as opposed to time testing. There is a component of time, but it's mostly performance. And those milestones are really what underpins the strategic plan and a lot of that is FRE. And so as we grow FRE, you'll see vesting. And so we think that alignment is very good. Hopefully, that helps\nGlenn Schorr: And the lumpiness -- Yes, definitely. I think the lumpiness or I should say, maybe even the stair-stepping historically of FRE is due to some of the big capital raises, has the growth in both global credit and investment solutions, is that enough to help smooth the cycle, if you will, or do we need to see more growth and say infrastructure retail, capital markets, the like. Is that even a goal to smooth that lumpiness?\nCurt Buser: So well -- so -- for talking fee-related earnings, I think over the past three years, we've seen nice step up in fee-related earnings in each annual year and I would say over the last three years that lumpiness has not been that lumpy. For 2021, I've been very clear that you can expect similar FRE to 2020 as adjusted for that $30 million or slightly up. And that from a managed top line growth, again kind of similar, but you will see the more growth within the two segments of credit and solutions and some pressure on the fee side in global private equity, simply as its real -- its realizations we're expecting to be really good and so that will put some downward pressure. And then as they get back end from a fundraising perspective, that will bring back up management fees and FRE in that sector. But that's in later years. So again, stable to slightly up next year or this year 2021.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. See you on the 23rd for the rest. Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I want to circle back on the discussion around solutions from a competitive standpoint, not that competition there is new, but some of the standalone providers have recently gotten more attention from public offerings and such. So just wanted to see how Carlyle and AlpInvest are positively differentiated there and also you mentioned the interaction between solutions and the rest of Carlyle is that perceived by LPs as an advantage? Thank you.\nCurt Buser: So let me start and then maybe Kew will jump in here. So the thing that I would point you to in terms of how we compete in the market for solutions and AlpInvest in particular. It's a long-standing business, great relationships with its respected GPs that invest with, but look at its track record. The performance in solutions and particularly and AlpInvest funds has been phenomenal. And I think that that really is a distinguishing factor in terms of how investors into that platform view us. And from a competitive standpoint, in terms of Carlyle, as well as the solutions platform, goes to market under a separate brand. We are very strong walls internally in terms of making sure that key information around their relationships are not reaching those walls, but the things from a fundraising perspective in terms of they want to make introductions and the like really helps build the platform using our distribution model to help them really bring around this very strong product set. So, hopefully that gets at most of your question.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nKewsong Lee: Adam, the only thing I would add -- Yes, Adam, the only thing I would add is, first of all, from our LPs perspective, this is a complementary strategy, not a substitute of strategy. So they are squeezing [ph] AlpInvest as a way to further optimize allocation into private markets to further gain efficiency through co-invest, etcetera. So it's very much now in the discussion with our LPs with respect to adding on to their allocations to private capital and sitting side by side with Carlyle funds. So that's a huge advantage in the sense of -- it's now portfolio discussion and that's why I say the existing client base of Carlyle is going to be a huge advantage for us as we try to keep growing AlpInvest. Second of all, competition is good. It's going to create further growth in this market. And like I said, all of these strategies are going to benefit from the fact that there are trillions of dollars in private markets right now and these LPs are trying to figure out how to optimize allocation and risk into a private equity private credit strategy. So to a certain extent, healthy competition is a good thing. It's going to create more awareness and growth in this segment, which I think has got good tailwinds.\nAdam Beatty: That's perfect, makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Daniel Harris.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for your time this morning and throughout the course of the past year. We are very much looking forward to speaking with all of you on our Investor Day on February 23rd. Any other questions you have today, please feel free to follow up with Investor Relations. We hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dan. 2020 was a year of growth and positive change for Carlyle, despite the challenging and complex environment. Our focus in 2021 is to build on our current momentum, and we look forward to providing more detail on our strategy for accelerating growth at our Investor Day in two weeks. Today, I'd like to focus on three points. First Carlyle delivered very strong results for shareholders in 2020. Second, our investment portfolio is in great shape. And third, our business model and organization proved extremely resilient and adaptable to the changing environment. Let me start by focusing on our 2020 results, which were strong across all metrics. We generated a record $520 million in fee-related earnings, with margins in excess of 30%. The substantial progress from just a few short years ago when FRE was less than half of this year's level. Continuing to grow FRE remains a primary strategic focus. Distributable earnings increased 18% in 2020, and we expect continued growth in earnings as our investment portfolios perform and mature. Our investment activity picked up sharply throughout the year. Despite the challenging environment, we exited the year with great momentum deploying $9 billion of capital in the fourth quarter alone, and $18 billion for the year. Our ability to consistently deploy in good times and bad demonstrates the value of our global platform and multi-asset class approach. We also accelerated our exit pace, realizing $7 billion for our fund investors in the fourth quarter and $21 billion for the year. And since the beginning of 2020 we've taken eight of our portfolio companies public and have over $17 billion of current value in public securities that when realized will generate proceeds for our LPs and earnings for our shareholders. And the final highlight, we raised $27.5 billion in new capital during the year with nearly 90% of the capital raised from our global credit and investment solutions segments. We will have much more to say about the trajectory and scale of our next fundraising cycle at Investor Day. Let me now move to some remarks on our investment portfolio which is diverse and balanced and in great shape. A few highlights, our private equity buyout funds appreciated 19% in aggregate in 2020. Our largest fully invested fund US Buyout 6 appreciated 46% in 2020 and our latest fully invested Asia Buyout fund was up 34%. Our global credit funds also performed extremely well despite significant volatility during the year. Our opportunistic credit fund appreciated 21% in 2020 and our structured credit strategy appreciated 16%, positioning both strategies for future growth. When combined across the firm, our strong performance drove our net accrued carry balance up 36% in 2020 to a record $2.3 billion, which positions us very well for a substantial step-up in realized performance revenue over the next few years. The last point I want to make is on the resiliency of our business model and adaptability of our firm. Nearly all just about 98% of our capital is committed to us for the long term, in many cases, 10 years or more. These fund structures provide us with predictable and stable management fees regardless of market volatility. While the remote environment last year was personally challenging for each of us, our people and platform adapted rapidly during the year and our business operations were virtually unaffected by COVID. Our global investing platform pivoted quickly to operate in the new environment. Our investment teams effectively sourced and close new deals, carefully monitor our portfolio and completed IPOs and exits. We found new investment opportunities in regions like India and China and pivoted to private equity growth, particularly in healthcare and technology. And we provided flexible credit solutions to sponsors and corporates despite the volatile environment. At the same time, we spent countless hours with our limited partners developing a new cadence that enabled us to forge in deeper relationships with them despite not meeting in person and raised over $27 billion in a year when we weren't in the market with our flagship global private equity funds. 2020 has demonstrated our resiliency and ability to adapt, and we find ourselves well-positioned to manage through the challenges ahead to deal with the continued impact of COVID on economies, markets and our portfolios. Most importantly, we remain focused on the health and safety of our people and we owe our success in 2020 to their dedication, hard work and expertise. I want to say a sincere thank you to each and every one of them for their extraordinary efforts last year. Let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser to go through our results, and then I'll come back with some final thoughts. Curt? Thank you, Curt. We have worked hard over the past few years and our results this year reflect the momentum we have built. We're proud of the performance we delivered on behalf of our limited partners and our shareholders in 2020. And we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We look forward to speaking with all of you in more detail on February 23rd. And let me now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Hey. Good morning. Hey, Craig, it's Kew. Taking a step back, if you think about it. Clearly, the private capital markets have really grown and are huge and so it shouldn't surprise all of us that large LPs and small LPs are a need of what I would call portfolio management solutions as they optimize risk and allocation to the asset class. And the way they do that is by first focusing on secondaries, second, trying to add co-investment opportunities, and third, obviously, in a diversified way they're looking for potentially ways to pick up interesting new GP commitments, but in a more diversified way. And AlpInvest is a platform that lets them do that. And so this whole area of alternatives I think is just going to continue to grow on the heels of the fact that the broader industry is growing. So that's a big picture number one. Number two, it used to be that these types of solutions were very bespoke in the past but, increasingly, we're seeing large carry over from our existing LP base as we try to minimize or add to deployment, manage risk, work on co-investment strategies, etcetera And so about 40% of the LPs in solutions I believe are also LPs in our existing global private equity and global credit franchise. So there is a huge cross-sell, but also an introduction to all of Carlyle, which solutions offers us to be able to introduce to our LP base. And then, finally -- and we're going to get into this in Investor Day, the performance of these strategies has been terrific and we're going to -- we'll show you more of that in two weeks, so please be patient. But that performance is the underlying driver for why we believe in these three very focused strategies, secondaries, co investments and primary fund to funds, we see real growth opportunity ahead of us in solutions. Thanks, Craig. Hey, Dean, it's Kew here. I mean, look, we're about as busy as we've ever been, our pipelines are really full. And if there is one thing last year has taught all of us, it's that with change comes also lots of opportunity. Now the good news is our platform, be it regionally, be it different asset classes, be it different investment strategies, be it different investment sectors. We're well-positioned to go to where the opportunities are and be one step ahead. Valuation levels certainly very high, no doubt about it, but also the ability for us to add value, work with our teams to grow these businesses and help them, is also high. So that's the challenge, which is to keep finding these deals. And I think last year was a good indication of the way this platform can pivot, if there's volatility, we see opportunities in credit. If traditional buyouts get way too expensive, we see ways to grow in private equity growth investing, if certain western economy markets are a little bit more less active we saw a lots of activity in the Far East in India and in China. So our pipelines are very busy, valuation levels make it very difficult, but our platform is very well positioned I believe to keep finding great opportunities and create value. Thanks, Dean. Thanks, Rob. Hey, Ken, it's Kew. Let me give you a little bit of color as of the here and now. But I'd ask that everyone to be patient, because we will talk a bit more about this at our Investor Day. I mean, look, we're very pleased with our Fortitude is right now. Its adjusted book value is doing great, its annualized ROE right now is closer to the mid-teens and the liabilities are performing just in line with our expectations. It's got excess capital. More importantly, we have stood it up fully, it is carved out and it is ready to start scaling via reinsurance and/or acquisition. In terms of rotation, my understanding is of about $4.7 billion have already been rotated over to Carlyle in terms of assets under management, and this is on a track towards $6 billion, which we think will hit over the next year or so. Now, what's more important to understand is that rotation that's occurred is very broad across our platform. I think it's close to 25 funds have received the semi-permanent type of capital investment that Fortitude represents into our funds and it's across all three segments, global private equity, global credit and investment solutions. So the platform itself is very much on-track. We feel very good about it. And so the right question now is, okay, where do we go from here? And with respect to that, I'm going to ask that you be patient and wait because we want to talk about this a little bit more comprehensively at Investor Day in a couple of weeks. Sure, Gerry, it's Kew here. And I think you got [ph] to be bored of hearing this from me, this is one area, we're going to do a deep dive on in two weeks. The highlights though as we sit here today, you're right, there is great momentum in the global credit segment, it's a broad platform as you know. Our credit opportunity strategy is doing quite well. We're seeing, and all of you are seeing this, the CLO market is coming back, certainly, a pickup in activity level from last year and we are projecting to see continued strengthening in that market. With respect to some of the initiatives we have in the market today, I don't want to comment on them, because they are fundraising, but we do have global infrastructure credit for instance in the market raising funds. And this is a segment which is very scalable given what we have set up and we're also seeing real traction with respect to platform-wide special accounts and strategic accounts that can be on any one singular account quite large. So let me hold there and just say, we're pleased with the platform, the progress, the -- look, the dropdown in growth directly into earnings, but more to come in two weeks. Adam, the only thing I would add -- Yes, Adam, the only thing I would add is, first of all, from our LPs perspective, this is a complementary strategy, not a substitute of strategy. So they are squeezing [ph] AlpInvest as a way to further optimize allocation into private markets to further gain efficiency through co-invest, etcetera. So it's very much now in the discussion with our LPs with respect to adding on to their allocations to private capital and sitting side by side with Carlyle funds. So that's a huge advantage in the sense of -- it's now portfolio discussion and that's why I say the existing client base of Carlyle is going to be a huge advantage for us as we try to keep growing AlpInvest. Second of all, competition is good. It's going to create further growth in this market. And like I said, all of these strategies are going to benefit from the fact that there are trillions of dollars in private markets right now and these LPs are trying to figure out how to optimize allocation and risk into a private equity private credit strategy. So to a certain extent, healthy competition is a good thing. It's going to create more awareness and growth in this segment, which I think has got good tailwinds."

            "name": "Curt Buser",
            "content": "Thank you, Kew, and good morning. We performed well in 2020 despite the pandemic and economic volatility throughout the year. We generated $762 million in distributable earnings, our best year since 2015 and DE per share of $2.05 for the year increased 20% over 2019. Before digging into our financial results, I'd like to touch on three items. First, our outlook for 2021 fee-related earnings and realized performance revenues. Second, the trajectory of our effective DE tax rate. And third, stock-based compensation expense and equity awards. First, fee-related earnings were $520 million in 2020 and excluding $30 million in cost recoveries during the first quarter adjusted FRE of $490 million, increased more than 8% year-over-year despite not raising new capital for any of our global private equity flagship funds. FRE margin on the adjusted basis was 30%, up nearly 200 basis points relative to 28% in 2019. For the year, global credit fee-related earnings of $99 million, more than doubled the 2019 level. While investment solutions FRE of $37 million was also more than double the prior year. In both cases, top line growth drove the majority of the year-over-year increase and margins expanded substantially in both segments. Looking at 2021, we expect realized performance revenues to continue to grow and we expect to produce similar to slightly higher FRE compared to adjusted 2020 results. Consolidated top line management fee revenues should modestly increase with more noticeable growth in investment solutions and global credit more than offsetting some downward fee pressure in global private equity as portfolio realizations increase. Global private equity will see growth in management fees and in FRE when our next multiyear fundraising cycle begins for our large flagship funds, which we do not expect to meaningfully affect our 2021 FRE results. Our net accrued carry of $2.3 billion is now 18% higher than its previous peak balance and the remaining fair value invested in our carry funds of $95 billion is 50% greater than its average balance during the period of 2012 to 2017 when our net realized performance revenues averaged over $600 million annually. With our funds performing well and assuming no material surprises in the capital markets, we expect realized performance revenues to gradually increase in 2021 and then in the years thereafter surpassed our prior annual averages. Regarding our outlook on our DE tax rate; in our first year as a full corporate taxpayer, our effective DE tax rate was 5%. The relatively low rate benefited from the utilization of legacy net operating loss carry-forwards in addition to the basis step-ups and tax amortization arising from our corporate conversion. For 2021, we expect our effective DE tax rate will increase to the mid-teens as we fully utilize the remaining legacy NOLs early in the year. Thereafter the effective rate is likely to continue to increase annually before settling in the low 20s in later years. Of course, this outlook is based on current tax laws and should changes arise in any jurisdiction, our expectations for effective tax rates may change as well. Moving on, stock-based compensation expense was $29 million in the fourth quarter and $117 million for the year, down 23% from $151 million in 2019. The decline owes [ph] to the positive impact of granting fewer year-end stock awards than in previous years, as well as the departure of certain senior executives during the year. As part of this year's compensation cycle, we granted long-term strategic equity awards to a small number of our most senior executives, which are predominantly tied to achieving milestones in our strategic plan. As a result, we expect our equity-based compensation expense to increase to amounts comparable to 2019. Let's shift to a broader discussion of our results. Overall, we had an active year and have great momentum entering 2021. As Kew noted earlier, we raised $27.5 billion in new capital in 2020 with both global credit and investment solutions posting a record fundraising years. Global credit surpassed its previous record by nearly 50% and investment solutions raise more than twice as much as any prior year. During the fourth quarter, investment solutions had a final closing on its $9 billion AlpInvest Secondaries program which round up nearly 40% larger than its predecessor and its new co-investment strategy is now raising capital. In global credit, we had an initial closing on our second opportunistic credit fund, and activity in several platform-wide strategies both segments are positioned well for future growth. Fund performance was particularly strong. The fourth quarter carry fund appreciation of 11% in corporate private equity, 3% in real estate, 3% in natural resources, 7% in global credit carry funds and 7% in investment solutions. Fee-related earnings in the fourth quarter were $145 million with a 34% margin, up from $108 million at a 26% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the upside largely owing to higher total fee revenue and lower G&A expenses. Fee revenues for the fourth quarter of $429 million, increased 5% from last year, largely driven by higher transaction fees of $21 million, nearly double a year ago and up from virtually zero in Q3 2020. During the fourth quarter, we also activated fees on our new Japan Buyout Fund, increasing global private equity management fees from Q3. Fee earning assets under management was $170 billion, up 3% for the quarter and 6% over last year with a 28% increase in investment solutions and then an 11% increase in global credit, both driven by strong fundraising offsetting a modest decline for global private equity, as we continue to realize proceeds for our fund investors. Shifting to expenses, cash compensation was $202 million for the fourth quarter and $822 million for the full year, 4% higher than 2019. And we continue to be disciplined on managing compensation expense. G&A expense was $73 million in the fourth quarter, down from $95 million a year ago. For the year, G&A of $241 million declined 27% year-over-year, owing to lower travel expenditures as well as a $30 million litigation cost recovery in the first quarter. G&A expense should increase in 2021 due to a normalization in both items but we believe G&A expenses are likely to remain below prior peak levels as we capitalize on learnings over the past year. Net realized performance revenues were $87 million in the fourth quarter and for the year increased 50% from 2019. The majority of realized performance revenues this quarter was from our six US Buyout fund with carry from our Real Estate funds making up most of the remainder. In sum, we continue to be pleased with the durability and sustainability of our fee earnings and we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunity for growing DE over the coming years. We look forward to speaking with you all in a few weeks when we will go into more detail on our growth plan. With that, let me turn it back over to Kew for some final thoughts. Craig, let me start. So in global credit, it was a very good year, nearly $10 billion of capital raised, good growth across the platform and it's really nicely disbursed in terms of the various components of the business and including even the CLO business. And in AlpInvest $14 billion of fundraising this year, a record year for fundraising, its AUM has been growing nicely. And the thing to also remember then in the case of AlpInvestis the burn off that we had in a lot of AUM in early years is really from some of the two major investors or shareholders in that business prior to our ownership. And so really the growth in AUM is even bigger than what you kind of see by looking at the aggregate numbers because you got to take into account that historical run-off. The team has really done a nice job of repositioning the industrial base across that whole platform and that secondaries program was $9 billion now in terms of the total program size, it didn't turn on fees really until the fourth quarter and so that should be a nice driver of fee revenue growth for that next year. And then as you think about the co-investment program, they're not just in raising their next kind of generation of that and that will be additive to next year as well; so really well-positioned for continued growth. And just adding on the $13 billion -- a little over $13 billion of pending fee earning AUM is relatively evenly spread across the three segments, a little bit larger in global credit and investment solutions than in global private equity and a lot of that is really tied to as the funds either turn on as we complete fundraising or as we invest capital. And so both providing really good FRE ramps, particularly in global credit and investment solutions. Robert, hey, thank you for that question. Managing capital to really drive the business is obviously our core priority, making sure that that capital really is driving growth in earnings and growth in the business. And so making sure that we have capital to invest in our funds, new initiatives available for strategic growth initiatives, and then, etcetera is always a priority for us. But cornerstone to everything we do is making sure that we maintain our fixed dividend. And looking at how we will plan to grow that is we have indicated in the past is really as FRE grows, that's how we will grow our fixed dividend. So Yes, I would not expect anything near term because I already have indicated a kind of FRE will be similar to this past year, or slightly up, but when we are really kind of well-positioned for growth in FRE because that way we can underpin that six businesses what we want to do. With respect to dilution management, what we have said before is we want to be around 1% in terms of dilution. We're cautious with our use of capital and buybacks really in 2020 given the pandemic and all the related uncertainties. But you can see us kind of being active to think through how to make sure we manage that dilution both through equity grants as well as through buybacks. Bill, thanks for your question, and good morning. Yes, so as we talk about -- I presume you're talking about net realized performance revenues, so our net carry just to level set, we had $246 million of realized carry this past year, it was up about 50% from the prior year, but well below our average that we ran between 2012 to 2017 of over $600 million a year. We're clearly positioned to surpass $600 million, the wealthy [ph] accrued carry remaining fair value in the ground. But that's not going to occur in 2021 outlook. Capital markets could do something and we could exceed expectations to the high, but we could also miss and predicting carry is always really hard to predict with precision. What I said in my remarks in particular, was expect a gradual increase and things to watch is, so just in the past year, as we said Carlyle Partners VI turned on carry in Q3. We also said that we weren't taking carry at a full 20% rate, which was true through all of 202, we did not take carry on CP VI at the full rate. And if you look at where the fund is, it's nicely set up. So there is room to take it at a higher rate on CP VI going forward. More importantly though, there are many other funds that have not yet turned on carry that are in accrued carry. Asia buyout IV is a good example, Japan III is a good example. And so as those funds also get to positions where we're comfortable from a fallback management perspective and you know we're careful on that will signal to you as, as the bigger funds turn on, so that you will kind of know kind of what that trajectory is but that's also kind of thinking gradual increase does not all of that will hit on right away. Hopefully, that gives you some color, Bill. Mike, it's Curt. Really good analysis in terms of how to look at that and that's exactly right in terms of what happened back in 2012 to 2017 on average. But if you look at the past couple of years, that's not held through in the past couple of years. And a lot of that is making sure that the portfolio has been mature enough. And we're not yet at that place where it is fully mature to make that same kind of conclusion with respect to '21. I'll speak more to the outer years at our Investor Day in two weeks. But right now, I would be cautious about applying the same math to '21. Yes. I think, you always have to be a little careful in that math only because a lot of it has to do with makeup at any point in time. And I would say it's more a correlation as opposed to causality but over long terms in good markets and capital markets are making sure that know all of the big buyout funds are producing carry, that's where it gets a little bit more comfortable. Glenn, hey, thanks for your question. And as I said, these grants are mostly to the most senior people in the firm that can really kind of drive our FRE and our earnings results. They are largely -- or predominantly performance testing as opposed to time testing. There is a component of time, but it's mostly performance. And those milestones are really what underpins the strategic plan and a lot of that is FRE. And so as we grow FRE, you'll see vesting. And so we think that alignment is very good. Hopefully, that helps So well -- so -- for talking fee-related earnings, I think over the past three years, we've seen nice step up in fee-related earnings in each annual year and I would say over the last three years that lumpiness has not been that lumpy. For 2021, I've been very clear that you can expect similar FRE to 2020 as adjusted for that $30 million or slightly up. And that from a managed top line growth, again kind of similar, but you will see the more growth within the two segments of credit and solutions and some pressure on the fee side in global private equity, simply as its real -- its realizations we're expecting to be really good and so that will put some downward pressure. And then as they get back end from a fundraising perspective, that will bring back up management fees and FRE in that sector. But that's in later years. So again, stable to slightly up next year or this year 2021. Yes. So let me start and then maybe Kew will jump in here. So the thing that I would point you to in terms of how we compete in the market for solutions and AlpInvest in particular. It's a long-standing business, great relationships with its respected GPs that invest with, but look at its track record. The performance in solutions and particularly and AlpInvest funds has been phenomenal. And I think that that really is a distinguishing factor in terms of how investors into that platform view us. And from a competitive standpoint, in terms of Carlyle, as well as the solutions platform, goes to market under a separate brand. We are very strong walls internally in terms of making sure that key information around their relationships are not reaching those walls, but the things from a fundraising perspective in terms of they want to make introductions and the like really helps build the platform using our distribution model to help them really bring around this very strong product set. So, hopefully that gets at most of your question."

With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We hope you and your families are safe, healthy and doing well. Carlyle\u2019s third quarter results underscore our position of strength as we adapt and perform in the current environment. The hard work and dedication of our people and the resilience of our global platform puts us on track to deliver attractive financial performance this year. Our portfolio continues to create value on behalf of our fund investors, which we believe sets the stage for higher distributable earnings for our shareholders over the next several years. All of this momentum, combined with our senior team\u2019s focus on the long-term strategic direction of the firm, positions Carlyle for accelerating growth. I\u2019d like to touch on four important points underpinning our momentum. First, we are focused on growing FRE. We\u2019ve done this by scaling our largest fund platforms, while carefully managing expenses. This has helped drive our FRE margins up more than 300 basis points this year, and margins have increased more than 1,000 basis points over the past three years. We intend to continue our focus on FRE and capture the benefits of operating leverage as we scale and drive growth in the years to come. Second, our fundraising continues to be successful despite challenging conditions. Our limited partners continue to entrust us with more capital, and we raised $5.5 billion of new capital in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have raised $18 billion versus $16 billion for the same period last year despite not having any of our flagship private equity carry funds in the market. Most of our new capital comes from global credit and investment solutions, which are businesses we\u2019ve been building over the past several years. And it\u2019s worth noting that Fortitude, the centerpiece of our insurance strategy, continues to positively impact fundraising. By the end of this year, Fortitude will have rotated or committed to invest approximately $4 billion of capital into Carlyle funds, with more expected in 2021. The funds raised from Fortitude are attractive because of the recurring, permanent-like nature of this capital. The third point is our investment portfolio is performing well. Our overall carry fund platform appreciated 5% in the third quarter, with our global private equity business leading the way and up 5% as well, with particular strength in our Asia portfolios. Our U.S. Real Estate funds continue to perform extremely well, up 3% in the quarter, due to disciplined portfolio construction, resulting in virtually no direct exposure to the hard-hit office, retail and hotel sectors. And our global credit teams are executing at a very high level, with our CLOs now substantially recovered and collecting all fees as a result of active, thoughtful repositioning and trading within these portfolios. Let me quickly also highlight our exposure to the energy sector, which is facing cyclical pressure as well as secular issues. Our investment exposure to this sector has been purposely structured to be ring-fenced in a few industry sector-focused funds, and as a result, much of our private equity and private credit portfolios have very limited exposure to energy-specific investments. As a result of the strong value creation by our funds this quarter, our net accrued carry balance grew to $2 billion, increasing our confidence for significant earnings growth as realizations increase and performance revenues accelerate. It\u2019s worth noting that we turned on carry for our largest fund, Carlyle Partners VI. And while we remain in the early stages of monetizing some of the public and private holdings across all of our maturing funds, we have line of sight to accelerating realization activity over the next several years, environmental conditions permitting. The fourth and last point I\u2019d like to make is that our activity is picking up as we use our platform to originate new investments. We invested $3.7 billion of new capital in the quarter, and our pipelines are filling up as activity builds throughout our businesses. Our private equity business continues to show resilience. It remains our largest and strongest platform. Growth investments are a key pillar; and we\u2019re very pleased with the activity in this area, especially in our strong industry sectors like technology, healthcare, consumer and financial services. Our global reach also continues to be a competitive differentiator. We have been quite busy in Asia, notably China, India and Korea. And we have closed or announced more than $1.5 billion of new investments in 2020. And while the industry\u2019s large, complex buyout volume has been muted, our teams are more active assessing traditionally larger opportunities like take-privates and carve-outs. And this is demonstrated through the announcement this morning that we have agreed to acquire Flender, a global leader in mechanical and electrical drive technology, in a carve-out from Siemens for \u20ac2 billion. Lastly, in Global Credit, we\u2019re seeing good deal flow in our opportunistic credit funds, as mid-cap private companies have a growing need for transitional capital. Before handing it over to Curt, a few comments on the environment. The economic recovery continues to be uneven based on region, asset class and industry sector. As the recovery progresses in different ways, dispersion of outcomes is becoming apparent. Some sectors have seen acceleration of growth, while other sectors like energy, retail, travel and leisure continued to struggle. Capital market conditions have been robust and accommodative to new debt and equity issuance, but we expect volatility to persist given the fits-and-starts nature of the recovery. Disruptions from the impact of COVID are changing the way we live and work, accelerating trends and modifying behavior. While no doubt uncertainty exists from the geopolitical policy, health care and regulatory issues of the day, our global platform and deep industry and sector expertise is what sets us apart and will help us navigate through this environment. We are very well positioned to be selectively aggressive and appropriately circumspect as we manage our existing portfolio; and seek attractive new opportunities across regions, asset classes, investment strategies and industry sectors. Let me stop and hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser, and then I\u2019ll come back and offer some final thoughts.\nCurt Buser: Thanks, Kew, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a few observations on our expected growth in distributable earnings based on our strong fund performance. Then I will wrap up with a review of our current results. As Kew mentioned, our fund performance continued to build on the strong momentum from last quarter, with third quarter carry fund appreciation of 5% in Corporate Private Equity, 2% in Real Assets and 4% in Global Credit. Investment Solutions appreciation was 8%, with the standard one-quarter reporting lag in many of its funds. This strong performance is most visible in the growth of our net accrued performance revenue, which as Kew indicated reached nearly $2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 14% on a year-to-date basis. The increase this quarter was largely driven by strength in our sixth U.S. buyout fund, which appreciated 4% in the quarter and 28% year-to-date; as well as our fourth Asia buyout fund, which appreciated 17% in the quarter and is also up 28% year-to-date. Both of these funds are fully invested and in a strong accrued carry position. We expect these funds, together with several others, including our U.S. Real Estate funds, will be strong drivers of continued growth in net performance revenues. With regard to realization of performance revenues, we continue to be confident in a significant ramp over the next few years. In the third quarter, we saw an important step in that direction, with both Carlyle Partners VI and our Ireland fund realizing carry for the first time. We are typically cautious when we first take cash carry as we look to minimize the risk of any future clawback. We look at whether a fund is fully invested, the valuation and time buffer between the fund\u2019s fair value and its preferred return hurdle and how much capital has been returned to our limited partners. Our first carry realizations in a fund are also typically at less than our contractual 20% share, which we recapture with higher carry rates on later exits. Once we turn on carry in a fund, we expect that fund to continue to realize carry on future exits, absent some unforeseen turn of events. The decision to initiate realized carry on these two funds demonstrates our confidence in their performance and maturity. And they are just two of several funds with meaningful accrued performance revenue which could begin to monetize in the near future. Now let me walk you through our third quarter 2020 and year-to-date financial results and touch on some key business drivers as we look forward. Fee-related earnings were $119 million, with a 30% margin for the third quarter of 2020, up from $109 million and a 27% margin in the third quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, fee-related earnings of $375 million and a 32% margin remain ahead of the $345 million in FRE achieved in the prior year-to-date period, though the current year result includes the positive impact of the $30 million of cost recoveries in the first quarter of this year. I have previously commented on the growth in revenues in our Global Credit business together with our continued investment in that business. It\u2019s now appropriate to call out that this effort has culminated in nearly doubling FRE in Global Credit on a year-to-date basis to $65 million, as compared to $34 million a year ago, with FRE margins increasing to 25% from 14% over that same time period. The same story is true in Investment Solutions, where it has also doubled its year-to-date FRE to $34 million from $17 million a year ago, with a similar improvement in its margin. These businesses have each benefited from strong fundraising in the current year, and we intend to continue to build on this success. Fee revenues for the third quarter were $394 million, roughly in line with the third quarter of last year. Current quarter revenue includes the full recovery of the $8 million of previously deferred CLO subordinated fees, as the repositioning and improvement in the underlying portfolios has supported a much faster-than-expected recovery. To be clear: All subordinated fees in our CLO portfolio are now fully recovered; and we expect to collect all base and subordinated fees going forward, absent a material change lower in credit markets. We continue to carefully manage our overall compensation structure, which will help us drive higher FRE and margin across the cycle. Cash compensation was $205 million for the third quarter; and $619 million year-to-date, approximately 3% higher than the year-to-date pace in 2019. Equity-based compensation was $87 million year-to-date and is running 25% below the prior year level. G&A expense was $62 million in the third quarter and continues to track materially lower compared to the $81 million in G&A expense a year ago. Travel and conference expenditures remained low relative to prior periods, and we expect these costs to remain depressed for the next several quarters. Some of these costs will return as activity levels increase post pandemic, but we believe many will prove to be permanent savings as we capitalize on learnings from this current environment. Looking forward, we expect full year 2020 fee-related earnings to be at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance range of $475 million for 2020, though I will reiterate that this result includes the aforementioned expense recoveries in the first quarter. We are currently in the process of evaluating our 2021 outlook for FRE, and consistent with past practice, we will share that with you next year. Net realized performance revenues remained modest in the third quarter at $40 million, bringing us to $159 million year-to-date and approaching the $164 million we generated for all of last year, but as I\u2019ve said, we are confident in a strong rebound in performance revenue realizations beginning next year and then further increasing in subsequent years. Distributable earnings were $152 million for the third quarter and $525 million year-to-date compared to $475 million in the prior year-to-date period. DE per share was $0.40 for the quarter and $1.41 year-to-date. And we declare our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. In sum, we are pleased with the durability and sustainability of our fee earnings, and we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunity for growing distributable earnings over the coming years. With that, let me turn it back over to Kew for some final thoughts.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Curt. The third quarter demonstrates that Carlyle is delivering attractive results. We are focused on adapting and are evolving the way we operate our business to accelerate our growth in what will undoubtedly be a very different environment in the years to come. I\u2019m very proud of our people around the world and want to thank all of them for their dedication, hard work and commitment to all of our stakeholders. Our leadership team is excited about the strategic direction of the firm, and we look forward to discussing this more broadly with all of you in 2021. With that, we are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. So I mean you had some good growth on the fundraising side between sectors versus and credit. I\u2019m curious with the biggest buyouts, I think in the range of 47%, 26% and 25% committed. Can we just talk about if anything has changed on your outlook for the next \u2013 the timing of the next round of fundraising for that big super cycle? Thanks.\nCurt Buser: Glenn, it\u2019s Curt. Hey, thanks for the question. Look, you appropriately pointed out that actually momentum seems to be going really well. We\u2019re excited about our pipelines and really the deals that we think that can get done. And with that, I will say that things are coming forward a tad but still too early to tell. We\u2019re going to give you our full multiyear kind of analysis, especially around 2021, at the beginning of next year, but let me just tell you now that you\u2019re right that some of the big funds are well-positioned, but here in the short-term we\u2019re going to continue to have a variety of products in the market, most importantly investment solutions and global credit. And then we\u2019ll see also a few other of our growth funds coming to market as we speak. So we\u2019re in good shape at this point, and more to comment as we kick off at the beginning of next year.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. There would seem to be the potential for a higher U.S. corporate tax rate and the potential for a much higher dividend and capital gains tax rate for the wealthy. Does the potential for the higher corporate tax rate play into the way you think about making and harvesting corporate investments here in the U.S.? And would a much higher dividend and capital tax rate for the wealthy influence the way you think about capital allocation between dividends, buybacks and investments back into the business? Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Hey Ken, it\u2019s Kew. Look, appreciate all the interests in this topic, but really it\u2019s just too early to comment. And it\u2019s not worth speculating given the limited details that we do know, but suffice it to say there\u2019s a lot of work going on. We\u2019re scenario planning, thinking through all the implications, but here is the bottom line. Look, we\u2019re long-term investors. We\u2019ve been around for a long time, working successfully through all types of environments, markets, administration and changes \u2013 and changes in tax policy. I\u2019m confident that the firm will be prepared regardless of whatever the outcomes are. Now there are maybe two other points I\u2019d make, one a little bit broader and the other maybe a little bit more granular. First, the history and track record of our asset class suggests alternative assets generate relative outperformance for LPs regardless of tax environment. So this is important to keep in mind because, at the end of the day, the alpha and relative performance we\u2019re generating ought to continue to provide tailwinds and demand for what we do regardless of any potential changes in tax policy. Second and finally, please remember, when we converted to a C corp, the path Carlyle chose was to become a true C corporation, as opposed to an up-C or a hybrid C corporation. As a reminder, our structure is really very simple. It\u2019s one class of shares, one share, one vote. This means that whatever changes the current taxes, the simplicity of our C corp structure makes it much easier to understand and manage through future tax changes. It also means real alignment, as we don\u2019t have private shareholders or public shareholder distinctions. All of us are shareholders owning the same shares just like you.\nKen Worthington: Sounds great. Thank you very much.\nCurt Buser: Ken, it\u2019s Curt. Let me just add onto that one quick comment, Ken, on your dividend question. We implemented a fixed annual dividend of $1.00, $0.25 a quarter; do not see any of the tax proposals as changing that fixed dividend. We\u2019re confident with that. The real question is, when do we increase our dividend and that will come as we continue to grow.\nKen Worthington: Awesome. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDean Stephan: Hey guys, this is Dean Stephan on for Mike Carrier. It looks like some investment solution funds moved into accrued carry in 3Q, where Carlyle has a higher performance revenue stake, so wondering if you could update us on the potential financial impact of these funds, Carlyle\u2019s performance stake in these funds versus prior funds and maybe how we should think about the potential timing of performance fee generation moving forward. Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Great observation. Look, I\u2019m really proud of our Investment Solutions team and how they\u2019ve been performing. The funds were up 8% here in the current quarter, and you\u2019re right. Accrued carry came back up. Now that\u2019s across the whole portfolio and so there\u2019s a blend. So there are some that of pieces that we\u2019re \u2013 our acquisition, in terms of what we\u2019re entitled to as small, 10% to 15%; and then at the much higher end at a 40% piece of all of that on a net basis. There\u2019s about $100 million net accrued carry. That\u2019s going to come over time. These are European-style waterfalls, but what I\u2019m really excited about with Investment Solutions is the FRE ramp. It\u2019s doubled versus last year, and their continued strong fundraising is going to enable us to continue to see the ramp in FRE. This is a good FRE business for us, plus it\u2019s also just performing really well. So thanks for your question.\nDean Stephan: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O\u2019Hara from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. And perhaps just actually picking up a little bit on that FRE ramp, especially as it relates to Global Credit and Investment Solutions. Appreciate the pickup, I guess, year-to-date and year-over-year, but can you perhaps help us frame where that FRE margin could continue to go, especially within those two businesses, if they still are kind of relatively early innings with that growth trajectory? Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Gerry, thanks. Look, you\u2019re right. I mean they\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve gone from, call it, mid-teens, so \u2013 mid-20s. We need to continue to grow that, and our credit business should be much greater. So watch for that to continue to grow over the next several years. That\u2019s going to be a really good growth driver for FRE and will improve our overall margins. Investment Solutions, same thing. As it kind of continues to perform as to its AUM base and as we\u2019ve also been adding other products within that sector, I see that also being a bigger driver of FRE. And there will be improvement in margin. Credit will have a much better upward trajectory, as you can see from \u2013 just from industry analyses. Investment Solutions will be a good driver of total FRE, as opposed to, say, margin per se.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, Good Morning Kew, Curt. Hope you are both doing well.\nCurt Buser: Good morning. How are you?\nCraig Siegenthaler: So I have another FRE question. And if I can sneak in a two-parter, I\u2019d really appreciate it, but first one, just given the improving macro backdrop, are we out of the woods with CLO sub fee deferrals? And number two is G&A is down roughly 30% during the first nine months of 2020. Where could G&A head into 2021 and 2022 as both T&E normalizes and also there could be some future investments?\nCurt Buser: Great. Thanks. Look, the CLOs, if you think about it broadly, what\u2019s really happened here is we\u2019ve got a big team. They\u2019ve worked really hard and they\u2019ve been successful and really taking advantage of it. What we\u2019ve also seen is rating agency downgrades have really slowed down. We\u2019ve seen a pickup from new CLO formation. We\u2019ve issued new CLOs. And then really the question that you\u2019re really asking that I think about is really how is the real economy going to perform next year. And if the M&A market comes back and accelerates, our CLO business will do really well. If we see some sort of big downturn in the real economy, which then also comes through into the credit markets, obviously that will be a challenge, but right now our CLOs have done really well and really repositioned. We recaptured all of those subordinated fees, so I\u2019m feeling pretty good about where we are, as I said in my opening remarks. On your second question, on G&A, you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve had a real benefit in G&A expenses this year. Now some of that in the first quarter is the recovery of the litigation costs, so that portion, you\u2019ve got to take out of the analysis, but even absent that, it\u2019s a very good kind of improvement. And obviously travel, conference costs are down, but also other things and professional fees, litigation costs, et cetera are also down. There\u2019s a number of things that we think that we can permanently benefit. We are changing the way we live and work, to quote Kew, and I think a lot of that could be permanent savings. So you\u2019re going to see some of this recovery, but I think a lot of it can also be permanent. The exact amounts, we\u2019ll tell you in time, but we\u2019re working through that and think that we can save a good part of this and really manage our expense lines very well going forward.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d just be curious to hear your latest updated outlook on investment returns on both existing investments you have in the ground today that may see some longer hold periods and then also on the new investments that you\u2019re putting to work here. What sort of returns are you underwriting to across your different strategies? And how is that attribution of the return profile maybe evolving a bit in terms of the key drivers of that in terms of leverage and so forth versus operational improvements, versus what you\u2019ve done in the past?\nKewsong Lee: Mike, thanks for that question. I mean, look, this is a challenging investment environment, right? You have low yields, a lot of competition. And in the midst of all this, we have dislocation and disruption, as certain industries and certain regions are doing really well and others are, quite frankly, being left behind given the dispersion that we\u2019re seeing as it relates to what\u2019s happening because of COVID. Having said that, we do see prices still are very high for very-high-growth businesses but with low interest rates and low discount rates. And if these growth rates can truly materialize into real businesses that are built, you can see why those types of prices are justified, but we\u2019re also seeing good activity starting to build in what I would say more traditional sectors, industrial sectors, et cetera, like the deal that we announced this morning, which are a little bit more \u2013 have a little bit more of a value aspect to it. But having said that, the main driver of returns moving forward: We\u2019re not underwriting to multiple expansion. We\u2019re not underwriting to more benefit for financial leverage given that quantum is pretty high right now and cost of capital is pretty low. So the real driver of an alpha in our asset class is going to be driven by making these businesses better, by improving them, like growing the top line, improving margins, increasing capital efficiency. And this is what our platform is perfectly positioned to help our management partners execute against and do. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. That\u2019s why we partner with our teams over the long term. So when you start with this global platform, great industry expertise; and then you add on top of that all of our corporate resources from our capital market expertise to our procurement experts, our digital experts, human capital experts, all helping our teams and our management teams, our portfolio companies grow, you can see why we feel pretty good about our positioning and continue to drive performance. So yes, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s competitive, but Mike, it\u2019s always been competitive in our industry. So it\u2019s all about driving and creating fundamental value with a long-term perspective, working in partnership with our management teams to do the old-fashioned work of growing and making these businesses better.\nCurt Buser: And let me just add onto that, Mike, because you asked also about our current \u2013 our portfolio. So just to remind everybody, Corporate Private Equity, our big business, 5% appreciation this quarter, that\u2019s after 13% appreciation in Q2. And that results in an 11% appreciation over the last 12 months. So that business is doing very well from a performance perspective.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks for the color. I don\u2019t know if you had any specifics in terms of targeted returns, though, that you\u2019re willing to share.\nKewsong Lee: The target returns depends on the thesis and the underlying nature of the deal and the risks, right? The more growth-y and the more risk there is in the business plan and in the deal, the higher rates of return we\u2019re going to be underwriting to. Those that are very, very cash flow generative with recurring like fee streams, clearly, we\u2019re able to push ourselves and stretch a bit more on price. In terms of what we\u2019re shooting for, we\u2019re still shooting for our funds to generate 2 times return on total capital in \u2013 on a MOIC basis in our major private equity funds. And our IRRs are still in the high teens that we underwrite to on average. Now it\u2019s really all about portfolio construction. And what you really want to do is assemble a portfolio with a wide variety not only of industry sectors but a wide variety of different thesis, different types of return and risk profiles. And when you assemble all that, what you\u2019re shooting for is a portfolio that is consistently generating on a gross basis the high-teens type of returns in the private equity business. That\u2019s what we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re striving for that, and we think we\u2019re well on our way to continue to accomplish that given what we\u2019re seeing today.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Kind of along the lines of portfolio construction, I just wanted to ask about the credit business given the good flows and the upward trend there. How is the book positioned right now just given some of the uncertainties? You mentioned some of the bifurcation and pandemic impact. Rating actions have probably been muted, so far, but could tick up in future. So just wanted to get your thoughts on the outlook there and maybe the interaction with the insurance channel.\nKewsong Lee: Great, Adam. I mean, it\u2019s hard to comment monolithically on \"credit\" because we have a platform that has a wide range \u2013 a wide array of strategies. I can tell you in our CLO business, given we\u2019re one of the leaders in the industry. We have full sector coverage across all industries. And that team is generating \u2013 has generated historically great returns with lower than industry average default and loss experience. And so we\u2019re very confident that they always are thinking about constructing portfolios carefully. Look, our Direct Lending business, there is a lot of opportunity right now as the private markets continue to grow with respect to being able to provide direct loans, especially, in our view, in the small to mid-cap segment of the market. The \u2013 let me jump to the distressed side. I\u2019d say, the distressed side, we are not seeing as many actionable opportunities as we like in light of the fact that liquidity and what the Fed has done has made our jobs harder, as liquidity has and the bridge available has extended the runways for many companies, but having said that, the pipelines of opportunities that we\u2019re interested in continue to build. And we\u2019re monitoring it day to day. And our suspicion is going to be that there will be more activity on the distressed side of the equation sometime next year. Infrastructure credit, which is a business we\u2019ve recently launched, is seeing a tremendous amount of opportunity in light of some of the issues in that sector, but also our limited partners are looking for really interesting risk-adjusted yields right now. And that\u2019s one area that affords very interesting returns in what is a volatile environment. And let me land on finally credit opportunities, which is really benefiting from volatility and the need of mid-cap companies seeking transitional capital. And the volatility that we\u2019re seeing and some of the uncertainty actually is helping that team as more and more companies come to them looking for interesting ways to secure transitional private credit during a time when they\u2019re trying to sort through what\u2019s happening in the real economy. So broadly speaking, it\u2019s really hard to comment generically on credit, but if you break down our different strategies \u2013 I think I\u2019ve just given you a bit of a snapshot and color on what we\u2019re seeing.\nAdam Beatty: That\u2019s very interesting \u2013 sorry. Go ahead.\nCurt Buser: If you were to aggregate it, Adam \u2013 but if you do kind of take this all together, there\u2019s really strong momentum in the credit space. If you look at the numbers, AUM $53 billion. That\u2019s up 14% year-over-year, and it\u2019s more than 40% over the last two years. Fee-earning AUM in this business is $42 billion. That\u2019s up 12% year-over-year and, similarly, up 40% in the last two years. I\u2019ve already told you about the doubling of FRE. So all of what Kew just said is being recognized in both fundraisings and in the way our AUM is growing.\nAdam Beatty: Perfect. Excellent. Thank you very much, both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nDaniel Jacoby: Hi, Good morning. This is Daniel Jacoby filling in for Alex. Thanks for taking our question. Just on the $475 million or better of 2020 FRE guidance, if I\u2019m doing my math here correctly, it looks like the implication is you\u2019re guiding to something like $100 million or better in the fourth quarter and which obviously I kind of see \u2013 I see that there\u2019s some room for upside, but it looks like there is also some room for that to kind of come down versus where we\u2019ve been in the prior two quarters closer to about $120 million a quarter. So can you just help us bridge from kind of the \u2013 where were you kind of running at, at about $120 million per quarter to kind of the range of outcomes that you\u2019re projecting for the fourth quarter?\nCurt Buser: Dan, great observation. Let me give you some clarity. Just as you noticed, $375 million year-to-date, that includes the $30 million in the first quarter. The \u2013 and we just did $119 million of fee-related earnings here in Q3. That does include the $8 million of the CLO recapture. So that puts us at $110 million. $110 million and $375 million is going to put you above the $475 million, which is what I was pointing out. So thanks for highlighting that. And if you \u2013 the real question, though, I think that you have is really what\u2019s that core run rate. And I will tell you that right now \u2013 and we\u2019re expecting to grow this, but right now we\u2019re in that $110 million to $120 million range. And so when you back out the $8 million, that puts you back down to the $110 million kind of level, but we have a lot of product coming online. Japan buyout, a $2.5 billion fund, for example, activates its fees here in the fourth quarter on October 1. And so that, coupled together with a lot of the growth in credit and in Investment Solutions and other things that we have kind of in plan, we\u2019re going to see top line growth. And that will really contribute to the FRE as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color.\nDaniel Jacoby: Got it. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks, good morning everyone. I hope everyone is doing well. I\u2019m just curious if maybe you can update us a little bit, just trying to get a sense of Fortitude Re. Like, it\u2019s maybe how it\u2019s contributing. It\u2019s \u2013 I know it\u2019s early days, but kind of update us on where that stands, its contributions right now and how we can maybe think about that flowing through in the coming \u2013 next year or so.\nKewsong Lee: Sure, Robert. It\u2019s Kew. Look, we\u2019re pleased with our progress with Fortitude. It\u2019s now fully carved out of AIG. It\u2019s completely standalone and fully operational. It\u2019s got a great management team. And Fortitude is an organization and, if you include dedicated employees over at service companies, close to 900 employees, so it\u2019s a real platform that\u2019s up and running. It\u2019s very differentiated from other approaches in our industry. It\u2019s got a diversified global book of business in both P&C and life. And in terms of its source of growth, it\u2019s reinsuring or acquiring legacy liabilities, as you know, as opposed to trying to originate organic growth in a single product like annuities. And the reason I point out those two things with respect to differentiation, the diversified book is important because it provides more capital efficiency. And it\u2019s recognized as such versus that of a monoline insurer. And then obviously, we like our B2B approach, where we are looking to acquire legacy liabilities, as opposed to trying to originate and dealing with the end consumer in terms of originating new policies. The way Fortitude is contributing to Carlyle really is in three ways, and it\u2019s been great thus far. First, our balance sheet investment is growing quite nicely. Fortitude is generating right now close to mid-teens types of return on equity, and so we\u2019re quite pleased with how our balance sheet investment has gone. Second, as I mentioned in my commentary, we\u2019ve already rotated over $4 billion of capital, which is pretty sticky in nature, right? So that $4 billion has come over into a wide smattering of Carlyle funds, everything from private equity, real assets and our credit products; and we do expect more to come. And obviously, those funds generate fees for us as well as carry over time. And then finally, to the extent we raise more capital for Fortitude, we have been able to do this by creating vehicles for our limited partners. And as we raise that money, we do earn fee-related revenue from those assets that we are managing. So there are three ways that Carlyle benefits from Fortitude. Looking forward, we are quite excited about this platform growing via acquisition. The space is large, trillions and billions of dollars of legacy liabilities that we think are available. And as Fortitude grows, that will benefit Carlyle.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning and thank you. I\u2019m just kind of curious to get your thoughts on the real estate business just in the sense that I guess that\u2019s one world that really has been kind of disrupted in a very significant way by COVID. And your current flagship fund is roughly half invested, and so I guess I\u2019m curious. How has COVID impacted the existing fund? And how has it made you think about investing the remaining half? And then \u2013 and I guess I\u2019m also curious about when it becomes time to start raising for the successor fund. Just in real estate, has \u2013 have the discussions and the dynamics changed with the LPs? Are they looking for different things in this new world?\nKewsong Lee: Okay, there are a lot of questions in that, but let me try to hit the high points. Look, we\u2019re investing in our eighth U.S. Real Estate fund. It\u2019s $5.5 billion of capital. And I got to tell you we\u2019re exceptionally pleased and proud of our team and their performance. We pride ourselves on very disciplined portfolio construction. Their approach is to set up a bunch of subsectors within real estate and, at a very granular level, looking at demographic trends, make investments which they think make sense on a risk-reward basis. And being very disciplined as they were, starting about two, three years ago, they pulled back. And as a result, we currently have virtually no exposure to the office, hotel and retail sectors in CRP VIII and in CPI, which is a huge compliment to our team for having constructed the portfolio this way. That explains why, despite all the disruption you\u2019re seeing in the broader real estate market, this fund continues to perform consistently and quite well. Looking forward, they\u2019re sticking to their approach, very demographic driven. They are looking at and trying to distinguish between secular and cyclical trends. And based on what they\u2019re seeing with consumer end markets and actually industrial end markets and behavior, it informs them on how they\u2019re going to be positioning and making investments in their asset-by-asset strategy. So look, I don\u2019t want to get into exactly when they\u2019re going to start fundraising or exactly where we think this could all go, but suffice it to say we\u2019re very pleased with the team. They\u2019ve done a great job with the portfolio construction. The results speak volumes in terms of their disciplined approach, and we\u2019re optimistic about the future behind this platform and team with respect to how they approach the U.S. real estate market.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. Thank you. That is it for me.\nOperator: And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Harris for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Ludy. And thank you, everyone, for listening to our call this morning. If you have any additional follow-ups, feel free to reach out to investor relations after the call. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We hope you and your families are safe, healthy and doing well. Carlyle's third quarter results underscore our position of strength as we adapt and perform in the current environment. The hard work and dedication of our people and the resilience of our global platform puts us on track to deliver attractive financial performance this year. Our portfolio continues to create value on behalf of our fund investors, which we believe sets the stage for higher distributable earnings for our shareholders over the next several years. All of this momentum, combined with our senior team's focus on the long-term strategic direction of the firm, positions Carlyle for accelerating growth. I'd like to touch on four important points underpinning our momentum. First, we are focused on growing FRE. We've done this by scaling our largest fund platforms, while carefully managing expenses. This has helped drive our FRE margins up more than 300 basis points this year, and margins have increased more than 1,000 basis points over the past three years. We intend to continue our focus on FRE and capture the benefits of operating leverage as we scale and drive growth in the years to come. Second, our fundraising continues to be successful despite challenging conditions. Our limited partners continue to entrust us with more capital, and we raised $5.5 billion of new capital in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have raised $18 billion versus $16 billion for the same period last year despite not having any of our flagship private equity carry funds in the market. Most of our new capital comes from global credit and investment solutions, which are businesses we've been building over the past several years. And it's worth noting that Fortitude, the centerpiece of our insurance strategy, continues to positively impact fundraising. By the end of this year, Fortitude will have rotated or committed to invest approximately $4 billion of capital into Carlyle funds, with more expected in 2021. The funds raised from Fortitude are attractive because of the recurring, permanent-like nature of this capital. The third point is our investment portfolio is performing well. Our overall carry fund platform appreciated 5% in the third quarter, with our global private equity business leading the way and up 5% as well, with particular strength in our Asia portfolios. Our U.S. Real Estate funds continue to perform extremely well, up 3% in the quarter, due to disciplined portfolio construction, resulting in virtually no direct exposure to the hard-hit office, retail and hotel sectors. And our global credit teams are executing at a very high level, with our CLOs now substantially recovered and collecting all fees as a result of active, thoughtful repositioning and trading within these portfolios. Let me quickly also highlight our exposure to the energy sector, which is facing cyclical pressure as well as secular issues. Our investment exposure to this sector has been purposely structured to be ring-fenced in a few industry sector-focused funds, and as a result, much of our private equity and private credit portfolios have very limited exposure to energy-specific investments. As a result of the strong value creation by our funds this quarter, our net accrued carry balance grew to $2 billion, increasing our confidence for significant earnings growth as realizations increase and performance revenues accelerate. It's worth noting that we turned on carry for our largest fund, Carlyle Partners VI. And while we remain in the early stages of monetizing some of the public and private holdings across all of our maturing funds, we have line of sight to accelerating realization activity over the next several years, environmental conditions permitting. The fourth and last point I'd like to make is that our activity is picking up as we use our platform to originate new investments. We invested $3.7 billion of new capital in the quarter, and our pipelines are filling up as activity builds throughout our businesses. Our private equity business continues to show resilience. It remains our largest and strongest platform. Growth investments are a key pillar; and we're very pleased with the activity in this area, especially in our strong industry sectors like technology, healthcare, consumer and financial services. Our global reach also continues to be a competitive differentiator. We have been quite busy in Asia, notably China, India and Korea. And we have closed or announced more than $1.5 billion of new investments in 2020. And while the industry's large, complex buyout volume has been muted, our teams are more active assessing traditionally larger opportunities like take-privates and carve-outs. And this is demonstrated through the announcement this morning that we have agreed to acquire Flender, a global leader in mechanical and electrical drive technology, in a carve-out from Siemens for \u20ac2 billion. Lastly, in Global Credit, we're seeing good deal flow in our opportunistic credit funds, as mid-cap private companies have a growing need for transitional capital. Before handing it over to Curt, a few comments on the environment. The economic recovery continues to be uneven based on region, asset class and industry sector. As the recovery progresses in different ways, dispersion of outcomes is becoming apparent. Some sectors have seen acceleration of growth, while other sectors like energy, retail, travel and leisure continued to struggle. Capital market conditions have been robust and accommodative to new debt and equity issuance, but we expect volatility to persist given the fits-and-starts nature of the recovery. Disruptions from the impact of COVID are changing the way we live and work, accelerating trends and modifying behavior. While no doubt uncertainty exists from the geopolitical policy, health care and regulatory issues of the day, our global platform and deep industry and sector expertise is what sets us apart and will help us navigate through this environment. We are very well positioned to be selectively aggressive and appropriately circumspect as we manage our existing portfolio; and seek attractive new opportunities across regions, asset classes, investment strategies and industry sectors. Let me stop and hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser, and then I'll come back and offer some final thoughts. Thanks, Curt. The third quarter demonstrates that Carlyle is delivering attractive results. We are focused on adapting and are evolving the way we operate our business to accelerate our growth in what will undoubtedly be a very different environment in the years to come. I'm very proud of our people around the world and want to thank all of them for their dedication, hard work and commitment to all of our stakeholders. Our leadership team is excited about the strategic direction of the firm, and we look forward to discussing this more broadly with all of you in 2021. With that, we are now ready to take your questions. Hey Ken, it's Kew. Look, appreciate all the interests in this topic, but really it's just too early to comment. And it's not worth speculating given the limited details that we do know, but suffice it to say there's a lot of work going on. We're scenario planning, thinking through all the implications, but here is the bottom line. Look, we're long-term investors. We've been around for a long time, working successfully through all types of environments, markets, administration and changes \u2013 and changes in tax policy. I'm confident that the firm will be prepared regardless of whatever the outcomes are. Now there are maybe two other points I'd make, one a little bit broader and the other maybe a little bit more granular. First, the history and track record of our asset class suggests alternative assets generate relative outperformance for LPs regardless of tax environment. So this is important to keep in mind because, at the end of the day, the alpha and relative performance we're generating ought to continue to provide tailwinds and demand for what we do regardless of any potential changes in tax policy. Second and finally, please remember, when we converted to a C corp, the path Carlyle chose was to become a true C corporation, as opposed to an up-C or a hybrid C corporation. As a reminder, our structure is really very simple. It's one class of shares, one share, one vote. This means that whatever changes the current taxes, the simplicity of our C corp structure makes it much easier to understand and manage through future tax changes. It also means real alignment, as we don't have private shareholders or public shareholder distinctions. All of us are shareholders owning the same shares just like you. Mike, thanks for that question. I mean, look, this is a challenging investment environment, right? You have low yields, a lot of competition. And in the midst of all this, we have dislocation and disruption, as certain industries and certain regions are doing really well and others are, quite frankly, being left behind given the dispersion that we're seeing as it relates to what's happening because of COVID. Having said that, we do see prices still are very high for very-high-growth businesses but with low interest rates and low discount rates. And if these growth rates can truly materialize into real businesses that are built, you can see why those types of prices are justified, but we're also seeing good activity starting to build in what I would say more traditional sectors, industrial sectors, et cetera, like the deal that we announced this morning, which are a little bit more \u2013 have a little bit more of a value aspect to it. But having said that, the main driver of returns moving forward: We're not underwriting to multiple expansion. We're not underwriting to more benefit for financial leverage given that quantum is pretty high right now and cost of capital is pretty low. So the real driver of an alpha in our asset class is going to be driven by making these businesses better, by improving them, like growing the top line, improving margins, increasing capital efficiency. And this is what our platform is perfectly positioned to help our management partners execute against and do. That's what we're all about. That's why we partner with our teams over the long term. So when you start with this global platform, great industry expertise; and then you add on top of that all of our corporate resources from our capital market expertise to our procurement experts, our digital experts, human capital experts, all helping our teams and our management teams, our portfolio companies grow, you can see why we feel pretty good about our positioning and continue to drive performance. So yes, it's hard. It's competitive, but Mike, it's always been competitive in our industry. So it's all about driving and creating fundamental value with a long-term perspective, working in partnership with our management teams to do the old-fashioned work of growing and making these businesses better. The target returns depends on the thesis and the underlying nature of the deal and the risks, right? The more growth-y and the more risk there is in the business plan and in the deal, the higher rates of return we're going to be underwriting to. Those that are very, very cash flow generative with recurring like fee streams, clearly, we're able to push ourselves and stretch a bit more on price. In terms of what we're shooting for, we're still shooting for our funds to generate 2 times return on total capital in \u2013 on a MOIC basis in our major private equity funds. And our IRRs are still in the high teens that we underwrite to on average. Now it's really all about portfolio construction. And what you really want to do is assemble a portfolio with a wide variety not only of industry sectors but a wide variety of different thesis, different types of return and risk profiles. And when you assemble all that, what you're shooting for is a portfolio that is consistently generating on a gross basis the high-teens type of returns in the private equity business. That's what we're still \u2013 we're striving for that, and we think we're well on our way to continue to accomplish that given what we're seeing today. Great, Adam. I mean, it's hard to comment monolithically on \"credit\" because we have a platform that has a wide range \u2013 a wide array of strategies. I can tell you in our CLO business, given we're one of the leaders in the industry. We have full sector coverage across all industries. And that team is generating \u2013 has generated historically great returns with lower than industry average default and loss experience. And so we're very confident that they always are thinking about constructing portfolios carefully. Look, our Direct Lending business, there is a lot of opportunity right now as the private markets continue to grow with respect to being able to provide direct loans, especially, in our view, in the small to mid-cap segment of the market. The \u2013 let me jump to the distressed side. I'd say, the distressed side, we are not seeing as many actionable opportunities as we like in light of the fact that liquidity and what the Fed has done has made our jobs harder, as liquidity has and the bridge available has extended the runways for many companies, but having said that, the pipelines of opportunities that we're interested in continue to build. And we're monitoring it day to day. And our suspicion is going to be that there will be more activity on the distressed side of the equation sometime next year. Infrastructure credit, which is a business we've recently launched, is seeing a tremendous amount of opportunity in light of some of the issues in that sector, but also our limited partners are looking for really interesting risk-adjusted yields right now. And that's one area that affords very interesting returns in what is a volatile environment. And let me land on finally credit opportunities, which is really benefiting from volatility and the need of mid-cap companies seeking transitional capital. And the volatility that we're seeing and some of the uncertainty actually is helping that team as more and more companies come to them looking for interesting ways to secure transitional private credit during a time when they're trying to sort through what's happening in the real economy. So broadly speaking, it's really hard to comment generically on credit, but if you break down our different strategies \u2013 I think I've just given you a bit of a snapshot and color on what we're seeing. Sure, Robert. It's Kew. Look, we're pleased with our progress with Fortitude. It's now fully carved out of AIG. It's completely standalone and fully operational. It's got a great management team. And Fortitude is an organization and, if you include dedicated employees over at service companies, close to 900 employees, so it's a real platform that's up and running. It's very differentiated from other approaches in our industry. It's got a diversified global book of business in both P&C and life. And in terms of its source of growth, it's reinsuring or acquiring legacy liabilities, as you know, as opposed to trying to originate organic growth in a single product like annuities.

And as Fortitude grows, that will benefit Carlyle. Okay, there are a lot of questions in that, but let me try to hit the high points. Look, we're investing in our eighth U.S. Real Estate fund.

            "name": "Curt Buser",
            "content": "Thanks, Kew, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a few observations on our expected growth in distributable earnings based on our strong fund performance. Then I will wrap up with a review of our current results. As Kew mentioned, our fund performance continued to build on the strong momentum from last quarter, with third quarter carry fund appreciation of 5% in Corporate Private Equity, 2% in Real Assets and 4% in Global Credit. Investment Solutions appreciation was 8%, with the standard one-quarter reporting lag in many of its funds. This strong performance is most visible in the growth of our net accrued performance revenue, which as Kew indicated reached nearly $2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 14% on a year-to-date basis. The increase this quarter was largely driven by strength in our sixth U.S. buyout fund, which appreciated 4% in the quarter and 28% year-to-date; as well as our fourth Asia buyout fund, which appreciated 17% in the quarter and is also up 28% year-to-date. Both of these funds are fully invested and in a strong accrued carry position. We expect these funds, together with several others, including our U.S. Real Estate funds, will be strong drivers of continued growth in net performance revenues. With regard to realization of performance revenues, we continue to be confident in a significant ramp over the next few years. In the third quarter, we saw an important step in that direction, with both Carlyle Partners VI and our Ireland fund realizing carry for the first time. We are typically cautious when we first take cash carry as we look to minimize the risk of any future clawback. We look at whether a fund is fully invested, the valuation and time buffer between the fund's fair value and its preferred return hurdle and how much capital has been returned to our limited partners. Our first carry realizations in a fund are also typically at less than our contractual 20% share, which we recapture with higher carry rates on later exits. Once we turn on carry in a fund, we expect that fund to continue to realize carry on future exits, absent some unforeseen turn of events. The decision to initiate realized carry on these two funds demonstrates our confidence in their performance and maturity. And they are just two of several funds with meaningful accrued performance revenue which could begin to monetize in the near future. Now let me walk you through our third quarter 2020 and year-to-date financial results and touch on some key business drivers as we look forward. Fee-related earnings were $119 million, with a 30% margin for the third quarter of 2020, up from $109 million and a 27% margin in the third quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, fee-related earnings of $375 million and a 32% margin remain ahead of the $345 million in FRE achieved in the prior year-to-date period, though the current year result includes the positive impact of the $30 million of cost recoveries in the first quarter of this year. I have previously commented on the growth in revenues in our Global Credit business together with our continued investment in that business. It's now appropriate to call out that this effort has culminated in nearly doubling FRE in Global Credit on a year-to-date basis to $65 million, as compared to $34 million a year ago, with FRE margins increasing to 25% from 14% over that same time period. The same story is true in Investment Solutions, where it has also doubled its year-to-date FRE to $34 million from $17 million a year ago, with a similar improvement in its margin. These businesses have each benefited from strong fundraising in the current year, and we intend to continue to build on this success. Fee revenues for the third quarter were $394 million, roughly in line with the third quarter of last year. Current quarter revenue includes the full recovery of the $8 million of previously deferred CLO subordinated fees, as the repositioning and improvement in the underlying portfolios has supported a much faster-than-expected recovery. To be clear: All subordinated fees in our CLO portfolio are now fully recovered; and we expect to collect all base and subordinated fees going forward, absent a material change lower in credit markets. We continue to carefully manage our overall compensation structure, which will help us drive higher FRE and margin across the cycle. Cash compensation was $205 million for the third quarter; and $619 million year-to-date, approximately 3% higher than the year-to-date pace in 2019. Equity-based compensation was $87 million year-to-date and is running 25% below the prior year level. G&A expense was $62 million in the third quarter and continues to track materially lower compared to the $81 million in G&A expense a year ago. Travel and conference expenditures remained low relative to prior periods, and we expect these costs to remain depressed for the next several quarters. Some of these costs will return as activity levels increase post pandemic, but we believe many will prove to be permanent savings as we capitalize on learnings from this current environment. Looking forward, we expect full year 2020 fee-related earnings to be at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance range of $475 million for 2020, though I will reiterate that this result includes the aforementioned expense recoveries in the first quarter. We are currently in the process of evaluating our 2021 outlook for FRE, and consistent with past practice, we will share that with you next year. Net realized performance revenues remained modest in the third quarter at $40 million, bringing us to $159 million year-to-date and approaching the $164 million we generated for all of last year, but as I've said, we are confident in a strong rebound in performance revenue realizations beginning next year and then further increasing in subsequent years. Distributable earnings were $152 million for the third quarter and $525 million year-to-date compared to $475 million in the prior year-to-date period. DE per share was $0.40 for the quarter and $1.41 year-to-date. And we declare our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. In sum, we are pleased with the durability and sustainability of our fee earnings, and we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunity for growing distributable earnings over the coming years. With that, let me turn it back over to Kew for some final thoughts. Glenn, it's Curt. Hey, thanks for the question. Look, you appropriately pointed out that actually momentum seems to be going really well. We're excited about our pipelines and really the deals that we think that can get done. And with that, I will say that things are coming forward a tad but still too early to tell. We're going to give you our full multiyear kind of analysis, especially around 2021, at the beginning of next year, but let me just tell you now that you're right that some of the big funds are well-positioned, but here in the short-term we're going to continue to have a variety of products in the market, most importantly investment solutions and global credit. And then we'll see also a few other of our growth funds coming to market as we speak. So we're in good shape at this point, and more to comment as we kick off at the beginning of next year. Ken, it's Curt. Let me just add onto that one quick comment, Ken, on your dividend question. We implemented a fixed annual dividend of $1.00, $0.25 a quarter; do not see any of the tax proposals as changing that fixed dividend. We're confident with that. The real question is, when do we increase our dividend and that will come as we continue to grow. Great observation. Look, I'm really proud of our Investment Solutions team and how they've been performing. The funds were up 8% here in the current quarter, and you're right. Accrued carry came back up. Now that's across the whole portfolio and so there's a blend. So there are some that of pieces that we're \u2013 our acquisition, in terms of what we're entitled to as small, 10% to 15%; and then at the much higher end at a 40% piece of all of that on a net basis. There's about $100 million net accrued carry. That's going to come over time. These are European-style waterfalls, but what I'm really excited about with Investment Solutions is the FRE ramp. It's doubled versus last year, and their continued strong fundraising is going to enable us to continue to see the ramp in FRE. This is a good FRE business for us, plus it's also just performing really well. So thanks for your question. Gerry, thanks. Look, you're right. I mean they've \u2013 I'm really pleased with the progress we've made. We've gone from, call it, mid-teens, so \u2013 mid-20s. We need to continue to grow that, and our credit business should be much greater. So watch for that to continue to grow over the next several years. That's going to be a really good growth driver for FRE and will improve our overall margins. Investment Solutions, same thing. As it kind of continues to perform as to its AUM base and as we've also been adding other products within that sector, I see that also being a bigger driver of FRE. And there will be improvement in margin. Credit will have a much better upward trajectory, as you can see from \u2013 just from industry analyses. Investment Solutions will be a good driver of total FRE, as opposed to, say, margin per se. Good morning. How are you? Great. Thanks. Look, the CLOs, if you think about it broadly, what's really happened here is we've got a big team. They've worked really hard and they've been successful and really taking advantage of it. What we've also seen is rating agency downgrades have really slowed down. We've seen a pickup from new CLO formation. We've issued new CLOs. And then really the question that you're really asking that I think about is really how is the real economy going to perform next year. And if the M&A market comes back and accelerates, our CLO business will do really well. If we see some sort of big downturn in the real economy, which then also comes through into the credit markets, obviously that will be a challenge, but right now our CLOs have done really well and really repositioned. We recaptured all of those subordinated fees, so I'm feeling pretty good about where we are, as I said in my opening remarks. On your second question, on G&A, you're right. We've had a real benefit in G&A expenses this year. Now some of that in the first quarter is the recovery of the litigation costs, so that portion, you've got to take out of the analysis, but even absent that, it's a very good kind of improvement. And obviously travel, conference costs are down, but also other things and professional fees, litigation costs, et cetera are also down. There's a number of things that we think that we can permanently benefit. We are changing the way we live and work, to quote Kew, and I think a lot of that could be permanent savings. So you're going to see some of this recovery, but I think a lot of it can also be permanent. The exact amounts, we'll tell you in time, but we're working through that and think that we can save a good part of this and really manage our expense lines very well going forward. And let me just add onto that, Mike, because you asked also about our current \u2013 our portfolio. So just to remind everybody, Corporate Private Equity, our big business, 5% appreciation this quarter, that's after 13% appreciation in Q2. And that results in an 11% appreciation over the last 12 months. So that business is doing very well from a performance perspective. If you were to aggregate it, Adam \u2013 but if you do kind of take this all together, there's really strong momentum in the credit space. If you look at the numbers, AUM $53 billion. That's up 14% year-over-year, and it's more than 40% over the last two years. Fee-earning AUM in this business is $42 billion. That's up 12% year-over-year and, similarly, up 40% in the last two years. I've already told you about the doubling of FRE. So all of what Kew just said is being recognized in both fundraisings and in the way our AUM is growing. Dan, great observation. Let me give you some clarity. Just as you noticed, $375 million year-to-date, that includes the $30 million in the first quarter. The \u2013 and we just did $119 million of fee-related earnings here in Q3. That does include the $8 million of the CLO recapture. So that puts us at $110 million. $110 million and $375 million is going to put you above the $475 million, which is what I was pointing out. So thanks for highlighting that. And if you \u2013 the real question, though, I think that you have is really what's that core run rate. And I will tell you that right now \u2013 and we're expecting to grow this, but right now we're in that $110 million to $120 million range. And so when you back out the $8 million, that puts you back down to the $110 million kind of level, but we have a lot of product coming online. Japan buyout, a $2.5 billion fund, for example, activates its fees here in the fourth quarter on October 1. And so that, coupled together with a lot of the growth in credit and in Investment Solutions and other things that we have kind of in plan, we're going to see top line growth. And that will really contribute to the FRE as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Daniel Harris. You may begin, sir.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Demetrius. Good morning, and welcome to The Carlyle's second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. For the second quarter, we generated $127 million in fee-related earnings and $198 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $0.53. We have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. To ensure participation by all those on the call, please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue for any additional follow-ups. With that, let me turn the call over to our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We hope you're doing well and that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. So before we get started, I want to thank Glenn for his partnership and friendship over the last several years. We accomplished a lot. And I am proud of the work we did together to make Carlyle an even stronger firm. He is a culture carrier and a class act. I wish Glenn all the very best as he goes off into a life of public service. Now on to Carlyle our priorities and our results. The combined health and economic crisis is a backdrop unlike anything we have lived through. I'm proud of how everyone at Carlyle has come together to do an amazing work and job on behalf of all of our investors. And I would like to thank our entire organization for their focus and commitment during these challenging times. Despite the current environment, we're adapting well and our business continues to perform. This is evidenced by our solid second quarter results, which includes strong fund depreciation, a substantial increase in our net accrued carry, and attractive distributable earnings for our shareholders. These results reflect the hard work of all of our people to deliver on our strategic priorities which remain on track. Specifically, we continue to grow our current fund families, and will launch new investment strategies with the potential to scale. We continue to drive growth in our global credit business and build upon strong momentum in our Fortitude Re insurance platform. And we continue to prudently manage our operations to further enhance margins. Executing these priorities will enable us to grow sustainable fee-related earnings, increase our dividend on a lag basis to FRE, expand our distributable earnings over the long-term underpinned by investment performance, and invest further in corporate growth and our shareholder friendly actions with the excess capital that we generate in the future. Looking forward in the near-term, COVID and other economic and geopolitical issues are likely to create headwinds in the environment, including a material drop in M&A activity, with global announced transactions down more than 50% in the second quarter from a year ago, and notably, large transactions remaining difficult to complete. Significant disruptions in certain industries, like energy, aviation and travel, and certain consumer segments. And weakening financial conditions of many municipalities, which could have disruptive effects on the infrastructure sector as development projects slowdown, especially for public private partnership is required, for example, in our terminal rebuilding project at JFK. Our public markets have experienced a strong recovery across all types of assets. We remind ourselves that we remain in the early stages of a global pandemic and are likely facing a multiyear recovery. The potential for an uneven and uncertain recovery leads us to maintain our cautious perspective on the outlook for the real economy, as regions, sectors and asset classes are all affected differently. But please do not conflate our tonality and caution on the real economy, with our ability to remain active to drive performance in the investment world. It is certainly possible to have a cautious and prudent outlook, while remaining active and successful in our core business, as demonstrated by our second quarter results. The very uneven nature of the recovery is what provides us the opportunity to be selectively aggressive and appropriately circumspect, depending on region, asset class and industry sector. Turning to our fund performance. Thoughtful construction of our portfolios around the world helped us deliver solid investment performance in the second quarter. Fund appreciation rebounded sharply, with a corporate private equity funds appreciating 13% in the quarter, which was the main driver of our net accrued carry balance increasing by nearly 50% from last quarter. Our portfolio benefited from improved public markets, as well as tighter credit spreads and better liquidity in the capital markets. With respect to investing activities, we have found attractive new investment opportunities, notably in Asia, as well as in global growth areas like technology and healthcare. We deployed just under $6 billion of new capital in the first-half of 2020, but we expect full year deployment to be below that of the past few years. We have $73 billion in dry powder and are well-positioned to deploy capital, as opportunities emerge in the years to come. With respect to exit activities, years of hard work led to attractive sales of portfolio companies during the quarter, including, among others, Golden Goose, Eggplant and Dealogic. In addition, improved pricing and market liquidity allowed us to opportunistically complete several secondary trades across corporate private equity and real estate. We were also able to execute IPOs of several companies in the first-half of this year, from our U.S. and Asia private equity business. With respect to fundraising, we have had a good start to the year raising new capital with approximately $12.4 billion raised across the platform, with particular strength in investment solutions and global credit. While, we expect to see the firm's fundraising slowdown later in the year, the fundraising environment thus far has remained generally resilient, since the onset of the pandemic. Now a quick note on one of our most important strategic initiatives, Fortitude. In June, we completed a process that started nearly two years ago, which has resulted in Carlyle and our partners owning 97% of Fortitude Re. We're now focused on driving attractive returns on capital, maintaining prudent risk and searching for growth by acquiring additional runoff insurance blocks. Fortitude is performing well and we expect it will be an important source of growth moving forward. Finally, as I said when I started, I am proud of our people and the work we are doing. Our people and culture are the most important priority. We are more focused than ever on diversity, equity and inclusion. We are in the judgment business and diversity of thought and perspectives is what gives us our investment edge. It is critical that we continue to push forward on cultivating an inclusive culture at Carlyle and incorporating ESG in all that we do. We are committed to drive positive change not only at our firm, but also in the companies that we influence and in the communities where we work. So in summary, putting all this together, Carlyle is in great shape and very well-positioned for the future. While, of course, there will be complications and challenges, I have total confidence in our entire global team, the strength of our platform and our ability to make businesses better and create impact to drive performance with our investment activities. Let me stop there and hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser, then I'll come back and offer some final thoughts.\nCurt Buser: Thanks Kew, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks, I will briefly discuss second quarter 2020 results and dig further into some key topics of interest to investors. Let's begin with our results for the quarter. Fee-related earnings were $127 million in the second quarter of 2020, with a 31% margin, slightly lower than the $133 million in the second quarter of 2019. So that result included $28 million in catch-up management fees, as compared to less than $2 million of such catch-up fees in the current quarter. Year-to-date, fee-related earnings were $256 million, which also includes the positive effect of the $30 million expense recovery, we discussed last quarter, and is ahead of the $236 million of fee-related earnings, we generated in the first-half of 2019. Fee revenues were mostly in line with the year ago after adjusting for the decrease in catch-up management fees, and the $10 million in transaction fees this quarter, as a result of closing the Fortitude transaction. Our net deferral of CLO subordinated management fees was $4 million in the current quarter, resulting in a cumulative deferral of $8 million as of June 30, up from $4 million at March 31. That said, our CLO performance is thus far stronger than we initially thought at the beginning of the pandemic and is trending favorably. Compensation was $210 million in the second quarter. And first-half 2020 cash compensation was approximately 1% higher than the first-half of 2019. We continue to closely manage our compensation expense, including equity-based compensation and the $66 million in first-half 2020 is 15% below the first-half 2019 level. G&A expense was $58 million in the second quarter, down from $80 million a year ago, reflecting lower travel and conference expenditures, as well as the recovery of certain of Fortitude transaction expenses and continued expenditure management. Net realized performance revenues were positively impacted by several attractive exits during the second quarter, as Kew discussed earlier. We produced $71 million in net realized performance revenues, largely driven by our U.S. real estate and our Europe technology funds. Year-to-date today net realized performance revenue of $119 million, is well above the $28 million generated in the first-half of 2019. That said, we expect the second-half of 2020 will likely be well below the first-half level. Overall, distributable earnings were $198 million in the second quarter, and first-half 2020 DE of $373 million was nearly $60 million higher than the first-half of 2019. DE per share was $0.53 in the quarter, $1.01 year-to-date, and we declared our quarterly $0.25 per share dividend. Strong portfolio and fund valuations drove our net accrued performance revenue balance to $1.8 billion, up 49% sequentially. Substantially, all of the increase is attributable to our appreciation in our sixth U.S. Buyout fund. Remaining fair value and public securities across our carry fund portfolio increased to 14% from 8% of total remaining fair value, as we IPO-ed to ZoomInfo and our public securities in total, appreciated more than 80% in the quarter. However, we acknowledge that volatility in either direction in the public markets could affect our accrual moving forward. Let me now shift to a discussion of the impact of Fortitude on our results and our fee-related earnings guidance. As part of the Fortitude transaction this quarter, we raised $2.1 billion of capital, upon which we will learn management fees. Fortitude is already rotated or committed to rotate nearly $4 billion into specific Carlyle funds. And we expect Fortitude to reach its $6 billion rotation target by next year. Let me now briefly explain the second quarter GAAP loss, which reverses prior GAAP earnings on Fortitude, none of which has been included in FRE or distributable earnings. For U.S. GAAP, we previously accounted for investment in Fortitude by recording our proportionate share of Fortitude's GAAP earnings, inclusive of unrealized gains and losses, resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives, related to certain reinsurance contracts. With the closing of this transaction, we now account for investments at net asset value, which still reflects a 10% appreciation above our entry price. Moving to our fee-related earnings outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we have generated $256 million in year-to-date fee-related earnings, relative to the full year 2020 range, we discussed last quarter of $400 million to $450 million. Given the strong first-half of the year and incorporated in our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our target 2020 FRE range to $440 million to $475 million. We are incrementally more comfortable than last quarter, but still cognizant of the many uncertainties that could impact results in the back-half of the year. Finally, let me summarize where we are following our corporate conversion. Following our transition to a Full C-Corporation on January 1, 2020, we have seen many of the expected benefits emerge. Our trading liquidity is nearly tripled, our top shareholders include many new high quality names, and we've been added to important indexes at Russell, MSCI and CRSP. Overall, there's been a positive set of developments. Let me now turn the call back over to Kew for some final thoughts.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Curt, and again, thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our firm's strong results for the second quarter, and more broadly, we are confident we are well-positioned to navigate through these uncertain times. We remain focused on delivering attractive returns for our fund investors and growing earnings for our shareholders over the long-term. And we'll do this with one of the best teams in the world. I will say again, I am proud of how our people have adapted and excelled amidst all that is going on. That is what we do best at Carlyle, and all of us are excited for what's ahead. With that, let's turn the call over to the operator and take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first quarter comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may proceed.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. Wonder if I could just get a follow up on your comments on Fortitude. You and a couple other players continued to invest in this space. It\u2019s a big space, so I wouldn\u2019t call it crowded, it\u2019s just more people focusing on it. So, you\u2019d mentioned buying additional runoff portfolios as part of the core growth. I'm curious what you see out there? And more importantly, how do those deals get priced? I'll leave it general, and let you go where you chose to?\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Glenn. It\u2019s Kew, how are you? Thanks for your question on Fortitude. So look, we're really pleased how Fortitude is progressing. And just to point out, it's a globally diversified book of liabilities at Fortitude. It's largely B2B meaning, we don't really directly originate anything from the consumer. It's definitely not model line. And from a financial perspective, we're really pleased with the fact that its capital ratio is higher than our target in regulatory thresholds. It's generating attractive call it, mid-teens greater return on equity. And with the recent raising of additional monies from our limited partners and strategic investors, we and them now control approximately 97% of this platform that, like I just mentioned is performing well. So, we're now turning to managing this platform for attractive growth and prudent growth. So, by maintaining an emphasis on policy holder surplus and making sure our risk management policies are appropriate, as you know Glenn, there are jillions of dollars of legacy liabilities out there that need to be moved off of the balance sheets of the insurance industry, because it's not efficient for them to be holding onto these types of liabilities. We are very well-positioned with this platform. It's a proven team. It's a diversified book. And now that we've been able to with our partners effectively gain control of Fortitude, we do look forward to growing vis-\u00e0-vis acquisition of these types of businesses. In terms of how do you price these books, very carefully. These are complicated books of business. I'm glad we got incredibly talented management team at this platform, and we're going to be very carefully looking at these books to understand what makes sense to acquire into Fortitude, so that we can grow.\nGlenn Schorr: I can't spell the jillion, but I appreciate that. Maybe just one quick follow up. Just I don't remember what's your lock up on ZoomInfo?\nKewsong Lee: You know, Glenn\u2026.\nCurt Buser: Glenn, it\u2019s Curt.\nKewsong Lee: Go ahead.\nCurt Buser: So just, in terms of the public securities in our portfolio, it's not our practice to talk about individual securities. But as we look -- and our practice has been -- is really so, as the markets open up remain liquid and healthy, we obviously look to what's right for our respective funds and stakeholders across and look for attractive opportunities to sell. Remember, we're not forced sellers. We look for the right windows. And when the securities are trading well, and we think it's in the best interest of all stakeholders, we\u2019ll sell blocks. But, no comment on that any specific position.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks for all that. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nDean Stephan: Hey, guys. This is Dean Stephan on for Mike Carrier. Just a question around the CLO subordinated fees. Although, the deferral of the sub-fees hasn't been too material, so far year-to-date at only $8 million. Wondering how we should think about the risk of additional sub-fee deferrals moving forward, kind of the puts and takes around that? And maybe what you guys are forecasting as the potential impact over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nCurt Buser: Hey, Dean, it\u2019s Curt. Hey, thanks for that question, really appreciate it. So, let me start with maybe a little bit of background. We have a large CLO business, where probably top three market share manages $27 billion of U.S. and European CLO funds. It's an experienced team. They've been through the wars before, including the great financial crisis and we came through that really well. We had some sub-fees back then that turned off. And we turned them all back, got them all turned back on and recovered all of those fees before. Our CLOs are performing better quarter-over-quarter. And, the performance and the trajectory is better than we initially thought at the beginning of this pandemic, probably if I knew what I knew now, I probably wouldn't even as mentioned the CLOs as much as we did in the first quarter. But one at least get that out there. I would say our team, what I'm really proud of is the activity of our team. There's been probably $3 billion of activity that the team's taken into account here in the second quarter, really to reposition the portfolio, make sure we're in the right place, manage our default rates, get the portfolio structured the right way. It's appreciated, I know on our own balance sheet, which isn't necessarily the same thing, but it's our CLOs and amount balance sheet is up about 13% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting kind of that improved performance. None of our European CLOs have turned off, while the U.S. CLOs are continuing to show some deferrals. We expect that either by the end of this year or beginning in 2021, we'll see those fees start to turn back on and possibly recoup all those deferred fees. The activity that we've had is really been really good in terms of focusing on cash. And really default rates at the end of the day is what you want to really look at. And our default rates continue to track very favorably to all kind of industry stats. And, this is amidst a time period where rating agency downgrades, at least year-to-date have far exceeded anything that's been before really in the broadly syndicated loan space. And so, this is despite all of that. So, again, I'm pleased with where we are. But, look, risks are ahead, you get a second wave, things get bad, the world changes. Obviously, what I've just said could be impacted. But right now, I'm feeling pretty good about our CLO book.\nDean Stephan: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. You may proceed.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you. My question is more broad, I guess, in terms of the cadence of economic shifts you're seeing kind of geographically and by vertical across the portfolio, maybe compare and contrast versus, when we were talking three months ago.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Patrick, it's Kew. Thanks for the question. It's a great question because what we're noticing is that this recovery is really uneven in different regions and different industries and different sectors are being affected very differently. From a regional perspective, clearly, Asia is out ahead. And by our estimates, China probably won't even enter into a recession this year. I would also point out that part of the world, particularly China, much of their recovery has been organic with very little fiscal stimulus. So they have a lot of ammunition left to deploy from a macroeconomic perspective. But clearly, what we're seeing there, though, is consumer behavior, even there is changing with skittishness. Travel's not yet fully recovered. Consumer discretionary is not as high as it used to be. And of course, the big issue is at some point, if the rest of the world doesn't pick up, what does that have implications to China. Europe is probably doing a little bit better than we thought and dependent on country. But in general, it's correlating to the fact that they may have made more progress on the health care front than we have. And as such, we're hopeful they're not out of the woods. But we're hopeful that there's a little bit of a step in Europe. America, you see what I see, it's uneven. Certain states are doing better than others. Certain industries are certainly going to be affected more than others. And I think it's fair to say there's still more to go with respect to declaring victory as it relates to health care, but also progress on the economic recovery front. In terms of industries, look, I think it's very clear there are some industries that have been very badly hit by COVID. And quite frankly, there are others that are just moving along and even have had their growth accelerated because of COVID. Especially those are tech enabled e-commerce, collaboration-based or cloud-based. And so, so really, it's one of the reasons why having a global platform like ours, having deep industry expertise, like ours, and being in all the asset classes with really strong investment teams is truly an advantage in this type of an uncertain and uneven recovery. It's why, per my comments, we can be cautious about the real economy, but are quite selectively aggressive in the areas we like, and are going to maintain a bit of caution and prudence as it relates to those companies and industries that are going to get hit harder. So, it's very difficult to characterize or answer your question with just a very flip, monolithic statement. It is a very uncertain, uneven, very differing recovery based on region, industry sector and asset class. But that's exactly the type of situation which quite frankly, Carlyle is well-positioned to handle.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nMichael Cyprys: So you had some strong performance, appreciation in the funds this quarter. I just hope that you could share a little bit more color around the performance in the funds. What are you seeing in terms of EBITDA and revenue trends among the portfolio companies? And what portion of the book would you say is more impacted here from this environment versus what portion of the book, would you say is not impacted? Or maybe even benefits from this backdrop? And how is that evolving relative to your expectations last quarter?\nCurt Buser: So, Mike, I'll start and then Kew might add on a little bit. So, just you know, again, if we look at it, we saw really good appreciation in our corporate private equity funds, and also real strength in our global credit business. And I'll just point out that the numbers that we do share on appreciation and global credit, really just relates to the 20%, 25% of the book that is in traditional carry funds. So, it doesn't really talk about, the CLOs which make up half and I told you that that's up, a lot or some of the other areas like direct lending and the like. And again, good performance across that entire book. In corporate private equity, the public markets are incredibly volatile. We've had real fortune with respect to some of the public companies that we've been able to take public, as well as some of the existing ones they've not only performed well, but the market has appreciated by and large, and so you see real appreciation there. A lot of that is in just the areas that Kew mentioned, we're strong in healthcare, and we're strong in technology, not just in terms of our public portfolios, but that's really makes up a good percentage of the way we've constructed. And again, what I like about where we are in even real estate, our U.S. real estate team has done a fabulous job of diversifying our portfolio, don't have exposure really in any material ways to hotel, no material exposure to big office buildings, no material exposure to retail. So, we've done a nice job of really being diversified and constructing our portfolios both in the buyout business and in the real estate business. And the footprint in global credit is really starting to take off nicely. So, I think that's good. Now, the one thing I will point out is, that I mentioned in my opening remarks, is our appreciation in carry was a lot driven by not just corporate private equity, but our sixth U.S. buyout fund, which is great. And I'm glad that that's a good place to have a little bit of concentration risk, but I want everyone to be aware of that concentration risk, but it's in there. If I had to look at my own dollars, that's a good place for me to be parking my dollars with that theme. I like that theme a lot.\nKewsong Lee: Yes. Curt, that was a great answer. Michael, I'll just add maybe just two quick thoughts, which is first, we're really pleased with two quarters worth of portfolio performance. But I just want to make sure everybody appreciates. We and the industry we're by no means out of the woods, in terms of, there is still a lot to play out with respect to this recovery. So, having said that, I can't emphasize enough the importance of how well we have focused on portfolio construction. Look, while every fund will have one or two deals that aren't going away, we'd like them to, in general, our funds have been constructed very well. Case in point is our U.S. real estate portfolio, where they have virtually no exposure to office, hotel or retail sectors in that portfolio, and thus performing exceptionally well. But to Curt's point, it's a lot of hard work that's gone in over the years with respect to constructing these portfolio as well. And assuming we can stay focused and work with our management teams, and stay vigilant we're hoping to continue to navigate through this environment, because of the fact that portfolios have been constructed so well. So, look, it's a great quarter. But by no means are we going to be complacent. There's a lot more work to do, which we look forward to doing moving forward to the second-half of the year.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nGerald O'Hara: Good morning. Perhaps picking up on the increased target for the FRE range. I appreciate the outlook there but perhaps a little bit of color on what gives you comfortability on that increased range? And then also if there's any expectation around sort of FRE margin? I think you talked a little bit about kind of grinding towards 30% in the past. And now we're sort of at that level, what we might expect in this kind of new and updated range, if anything? Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Gerry, it's Curt. Thanks for the question. Let me just kind of level set give a little backdrop and then dig into it a little bit for you. So, as we've said, $256 million year-to-date FRE now, and that has some benefit in the first quarter of the $30 million, CTC expense recovery. And then obviously, again, with the Fortitude transaction, we recovered some expenses there. So, I would say we're naturally tracking to the middle of our range of $440 million to $475 million. But, there's a lot of things I'm really pleased with this point in time. The fee growth and the fundraising that we've seen, really in our investment solutions business, particularly at Alpinvest, has been fantastic. The Improvements that I've already talked about and our CLO platform is good. In addition, we recently activated fees on our latest aviation fund, and we also expect to activate fees on our most recent Japan fund here in the second-half of the year. Although, that will have some timing dependency upon completing the deployment of the existing fund. And we have further initiatives underway, specifically in credit, which should also give us some uplift. As everyone knows the pandemic has helped to curtail some expenses, especially travel and conference costs. And look, we're continuing to be very diligent on expense management. And so if all of that continues, and if we get some further help from transaction fees, but as Kew mentioned, I'd be careful there because large M&A deals may be tough to do this year. But if things were to pop favorably, we could end at the top end of the range. But to be clear, I wouldn't guide you really at this point in time to that middle point of our range, but we remain focused on continuing to grow FRE over the long-term. And as it relates to our margins, but we're hovering kind of 28% to 32% this year, we're at 32%, year-to-date 31% here in the quarter, and we'll bounce right around that. So yes, we've achieved that. We'll get higher in terms of the mid-30s and higher upon completion of the fundraising for our big flagship funds. As that occurs, that's when you'll see the next major step up. Until then, I would think that we'll be kind of in the same kind of ballpark zip code.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. You may proceed.\nBill Katz: Kew, maybe I want to come back to you. You had mentioned some cautionary comments on the sort of infrastructure outlook. I was wondering if you might be able to expand on that a little bit, and perhaps tie it into where Curt just left off. How should we be thinking about maybe some of the flagship fund raising as we look out into \u201921 and \u201922 given your comments about some second-half plus or minuses? Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Sure. Thanks, Bill. Look, as a sector, infrastructure is something that has been affected by COVID. Clearly, the finances of municipalities and the tax base has been hit. And there are other weird ways that implications of the current environment affect infrastructure, for instance, general contractors with working safety rules have difficulty completing projects. So clearly, certain types of projects, development projects in general are -- they\u2019re complex to begin with. They get even that much more harder to complete in this type of environment. So, I would expect to see deployment to be more of an issue broadly speaking in the infrastructure sector. Now having said that, it's the type of conditions which over the medium to longer-term present great opportunity. When you have disruptions like this and dislocations, clearly, capital is there [ph] to complete important projects and to invest in infrastructure. And so, this is one of the things where I do believe in the short-term there are issues, but over the medium to longer-term the winds at the back of the infrastructure asset class in general. With respect to your question on fundraising for some of our flagship funds, all of this is interrelated to pace of deployment and pace of exits. And to the extent that that gets pushed out a little bit, it shouldn't be a surprise that fundraising would similarly get pushed out a little bit. I think, it's too early right now to tell you precisely, exactly when we think we'll be raising money for our next cycle of funds, so stay tuned for that. But clearly, mission critical right now is just to make sure our portfolio is in good shape, is to find these opportunities as the environment and adapt to the environment to find these new opportunities. And as our pace picks up, and no doubt as our exits pick up, you'll start hearing from us much more about beginning the next leg of fundraising.\nCurt Buser: And Bill, I\u2019ll just add to that, even with all those challenges and issues, fundraising first six months of this year $12.5 billion, and that's without really anything significant in corporate private equity, really just showing the strength of fundraising in global credit and solutions, and more to come. So, we're always having activity from a fundraising perspective. It just may not be at those super or larger amounts with the flagship funds.\nBill Katz: Thank you, both.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may proceed.\nRobert Lee: Thanks for taking my questions. And even though, he's not on the call, I'm sure he\u2019s listening, so Glenn, best of luck in your new endeavors and congratulations. Anyway, one business wanted to focus on was investment solutions doesn't get a lot of attention, but as a secondaries business, it seems like place that there should be pretty healthy growth and you've doubled FRE there. So, can you maybe update us on that? It kind of feels like maybe that business has finally reached some type of inflection point. And how should we think of that as an outside source of growth kind of the opportunities set there?\nKewsong Lee: On this one Robert, it\u2019s Kew. Let me start with some very high level comments and then Curt can help you a little bit with some figures. Look, we're really happy with our investment solutions team. I have to be careful, they are in the market right now raising a secondaries fund. But suffice it to say, when you have a strong team and a great track record, even in a COVID type of fundraising environment, it's a lot easier because of their ability to market their track record. So I've got a lot of confidence in that team. And I think you're exactly right. We are seeing broadly speaking opportunities in secondaries as limited partners and other owners of Alps are looking to find ways to manage liquidity and manage their portfolio, and manage allocations across their investment portfolio. So it's actually a very good time to be thinking about secondaries types of strategies, which positions our solutions segment and our Alpinvest team in a very good way. With that, let me turn it over to Curt.\nCurt Buser: So, thanks Kew. The thing that I've always been really pleased about, our investment solutions business is its performance. So, if you think about just our most recent the prior secondaries fund, for example, which was fully invested, and it\u2019s a Fund part [ph] 2011, it's 18% net IRR. If you look at Page 27 of our materials in the earnings release, the Alpinvest funds on a net basis -- and these are primary, secondary and co-investment blends to a 12% net IRR. I mean it's just really good performance for these products. The investors really appreciate it. It's allowed us to scale this business. And you're right, that's contributing to a real nice uptick in fee-related earnings, going from call it $6 million in Q2 last year to call it $12 million this quarter and they're not done. The other thing that I like about this business is, when we bought it, we didn't buy the embedded carry. And these are European style waterfall's, which means it takes a while for that carry to come into and be in and really be attributed to us. So, while you'll see low net carry numbers coming off of this business, because most of that's going out to other owners. As we move forward, our percentage of that will increase and that will make this also a stronger driver of DE going forward. Now, again, this business is not going to be like a corporate private equity business, but it will be a bigger component. And I like its increasing contribution to our overall platform.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nDaniel Jacoby: Hi. Good morning. This is Daniel Jacoby filling in for Alex. Thanks for taking my questions. Not to beat a dead horse here, but just to clarify a little bit on the updated FRE guidance. I guess two questions. One is what does this contemplate in terms of CLO subordinated fee deferrals, so kind of the range of sub-fee deferrals that you're assuming, it's in that for $440 million to $475 million range? I mean, just for comparison sake, as we think about kind of the increased FRE range, was the impact of the Fortitude transaction contemplated in the prior quarters, $400 million to $450 million? Or is that something that wasn't in that $400 million to $450 million guidance?\nCurt Buser: So, let me take a shot at these answers and thank you for the good questions. So the CLOs, just to kind of remind everybody, we are in about a $120 million a year annually on management fees out of the CLO business. So it's an important part of our business. Again, it's a $27 billion AUM business for us. So it's significant. Now, about two-thirds of that number roughly speaking, are subordinated fees that could be shut off. And so therefore, the concern at the beginning of the year was that could obviously have a significant impact, if rating downgrades were significant. That's proven not to be the case thus far. And so I'm feeling good about that. That has obviously helped us in terms of thinking about expectation for the balance of this year. But as I said earlier, there's a lot of other things to think about, the expectation. The Fortitude transaction coming through obviously helps. And as we look forward, our Alpinvest business is performing very well and that's done great. And so all of these things together has helped me, think through kind of the increasing our range, from where we were from the $400 million to $450 million to the $440 million to $475 million. On top of this, the comments really around -- I get a part of that was what drives, and again, it's these factors that they kind of get us there. And so, hopefully that\u2019s responsive to your question. But I just would caution people that things, there's a lot of uncertainties that continue to pop up in 2020. And so, we just have to be continue to be cautious while actually effectively executing what we do.\nDaniel Jacoby: Thank you, that's helpful. And can I ask a follow up?\nCurt Buser: Sure, Dan. Go ahead, please.\nDaniel Jacoby: Thanks. Just maybe you've touched on this throughout the call, but maybe just to kind of tied all together, some of the fundraising that you expect kind of between now and that\u2019s fundraising super cycle. What should we keep an eye out for?\nCurt Buser: So this year, we've done about $12.5 billion year-to-date. Early in the year we indicated $20 billion, that's still possible. I don't want you to put that down as a hard number. We just told, the second-half could be lighter. That's still a possible number for this year. And somewhere kind of hovering in that high teens to that level is what the business generally will be doing on an annual basis prior to the super cycle coming back in.\nDaniel Jacoby: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. You may proceed.\nJeremy Campbell: Sorry, juggling a couple calls this morning. So, forgive me if you've addressed this already in your FRE step up walk through. But I was hoping to give us some context on how to think about management fee rates? [Indiscernible] it looks like it stepped up a little bit quarter-over-quarter in both investment solutions and credit after you adjust to the CLO sub-fee drag. Now, I know obviously when fee paying AUM changes more dramatically like it did the quarter-over-quarter that there can be some denominator averaging issues involved. So maybe that's the culprit. But just wondering if you can give us an update on management fee rates and any potential impacts from here around either new funds turning on or any Fortitude impact?\nCurt Buser: Sure. So generally speaking, the funds that we have been raising from a fee rate perspective have been either equivalent to, or in some cases slightly better than their predecessor funds. So, the movement that you see up or down generally have to do with mix. And also the other key factor is when you get -- the new funds also coming in and you get the big step up from a larger fund, at full committed capital levels, that helps. And then you need to also take into account some places in particular our global credit business. Those fees tend to be more on invested capital rather than committed capital. And so as you invest more, you earn more in management fees, obviously, which makes sense. And that from an operating margin perspective, that is obviously very helpful because you're generally not adding the same type of expenses to the equation as you are from a management fee perspective. So, I would not get too focused on the effective rates at this time, because there's a lots of gives and takes. But the overall piece that I really would think about is that generally on a like-for-like basis, we're not seeing any decreases in terms. The terms are generally flat to better.\nJeremy Campbell: Great. And then now that Fortitude is all buttoned up, any potential impact to call out on that one too?\nCurt Buser: I guess, I wouldn't call quarantine or pandemic or uncertainties buttoned up. As Kew mentioned, I think we're still at the early stages of kind of recovery and seeing how things really play out. But what I do like is our core business. Our core business model 98% of our fee earning AUM is not subject to redemption. 90% of our fee revenues are long-term oriented. And that's all good. And then with respect to Fortitude itself, that Fortitude transaction changes essentially the dynamics around how we operate. So you saw the gap charge. But from an investment perspective, that business is well. It's marked 10% above what we have carried for. Its performance is right on track. Things are going well. With this closing, there's $2 billion of capital we raised, which will earn management fees on. You only saw one month here in the second quarter from that. So that's additive going forward. And then you have essentially as they continue to rotate capital in, essentially about $4 billion about now and are close to either committed or slotting in and then get up to the $6 billion, we'll see further uptake as that all rotates in. And then if we're fortunate to grow that business, I would expect further growth from said growth.\nJeremy Campbell: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. You may proceed.\nAdam Beatty: Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow-up on CLOs maybe add to your having flagged it before. But I wanted to ask about the environment there. I mean, it sounds like your team is doing a really good job kind of managing it. Is it a case of your team kind of outperforming in a weak environment? Or not to take anything away, but is the CLO environment generally just better than folks would have expected? Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Yes. Thank you. So let me just give you a little bit of color. So, from a macro environmental perspective, clearly, one thing that really affects this business is our rating agency downgrades. And that came in spades last quarter. It has slowed down. And if all continues as currently right now, to Curt's earlier comments, I think we'll be in good shape. Of course, if the real economy goes in a different direction, then the downgrades accelerate, then I think that does pose headwinds for the CLO business. In terms of new issuances, but we didn't quite mention earlier or maybe we did, but we didn't highlight it. But we did partake in two recent issuances. One in Europe, one in the U.S. I would say those two does not a trend yet make. But certainly, it's encouraging that we're starting to see some life with respect to new issuances of CLO structures. An important aspect of execution in this business is, quite frankly, our team's ability to trade in and out and manage the CLO portfolios. And to that, to your question, on this front, I think our team did an amazing job over the past three, four months, trading out of certain positions and trading into higher yielding positions, with dislocations in the market, such that our positions are better yielding and performing today than they may have been during the depths of the crisis. So, hats off to the team. But to your point about what's environmental versus what are we doing. I think that's one element where having great investment teams and having the scale and the breadth that we do, really helps in this business. So, when you throw all those things together, you can see that it's a big business that we have, we think we've got a great team, the portfolios have been repositioned in a way that I think makes a lot of sense. We're all keeping an eye on rating agencies and what they're up to. And quite frankly, we are among the first if not the first in terms of being able to issue new CLOs. And hopefully, that'll pick up in the second-half of the year. But no promises on that, because I think it's not quite yet in a place where you're going to see sustained new CLO structures emerging.\nAdam Beatty: Great, that's a really valuable context. Thank you. Then just a quick follow-up, if I may, on flows in fee AUM, maybe it's little bit housekeeping. But it seemed like a little lumpy in corporate private equity and investment solutions on the outflow side. So, I'm assuming some of that was some funds exiting the investment period, is that correct or any other color? Thank you.\nCurt Buser: So, keep in mind as we sell, that's our goal here. Our goal is not to in these closed end fund structures, which is kind of driving 90% of our revenues, our goal is to invest it, and then to sell it at a multiple and make money for our investors. And so you should always expect that our business to see outflows. It's not redemptions. Again, 98% of our fee earning AUM is not subject to redemption, but it's from realizations. And so, we had good realizations this year, and that's a big part of which we'll see. And obviously, other things that can contribute to that are some, step downs when you move around fee earning AUM and you move from the committed to the post the investment period, and so you can see a step down at that time. But generally most of the activity is from exits. And then inflows are obviously as we're raising capital around it and that\u2019s really has been a big piece. You also see some inflows as we activate for fee earning AUM, so as we activate funds that we have raised, which would be otherwise included in total AUM but not included in fee earning AUM, until we activate them, and so they'll come in there. And then some of the funds which are dependent upon us investing, they'll flow into fee earning AUM as we invest that capital. So those are what really accounts for some of the ups and downs in the roll forward.\nAdam Beatty: Fair enough. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Bill Cuddy filling in for Ken. So, focusing on your energy business, NGP XII is about half invested. So, getting to the range where we can think about the next vintage. But we have returned after fees negative NGP X and XI. What are the prospects for raising energy assets going forward? Do you think energy assets are going to be an asset class that investors will invest in? Or dedicated energy funds a thing of the past?\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Bill, it's Kew. So look, your question has a lot to do with what's going to be happening with carbon and alternative forms of energy. And clearly, there is a transition going on, but this transition in our views can take a long time. And in the short-term, obviously, the energy markets right now have been very impacted, with demand destruction, as well as destruction on the supply side, and a whole bunch of geopolitical factors that are impacting conditions in the energy market. But the switchover to alternative is not as easy or as quick as people would want it to be. And so our view is, there's going to be a period of time where both traditional forms of energy, as well as new and emerging forms of energy are all both going to be viable. Now, from an investment perspective, how we play this is very dependent on values, valuations, as well as the ability of management teams that we partner with to actually drive operational improvement, irrespective of commodity prices. And suffice to say, I think in the short-term, we're in a little bit of a wait and see cautious mode, because of all the issues that are affecting the energy sector, broadly speaking. We do have a lot of optimism for finding great investment opportunities in renewables and alternative forms of energy. And we have teams that are looking at that. But clearly, this is not just a switchover. And in a snap of a finger, one whole sector is gone and another whole factor has phased in. It's going to take time. There's going to be bumps along the road. There's clearly a transition. And while that transition plays out, my personal perspective is there'll be great investment opportunities in both worlds. And it's up to our platform to try to figure out how to best navigate that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks for answering the question.\nOperator: And we have a follow up question from Michael Cypress with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nMichael Cyprys: Thanks for taking the follow up question. Just on fee-related earnings, about two-thirds nearly of your distributable earnings this quarter. I guess where do you see that in the medium-term? Obviously, there's some moving put some takes near-term, performance fees a little bit more subdued and then you raise the next flagship funds, which would help on the FRE, but at some point performance fee get to more of a normalized level, which I think maybe would drive that FRE contribution or I guess, where do you see that going? Anything through the puts and takes? And where would you like the FRE contribution to be longer-term?\nCurt Buser: So, I think you're asking about the performance fees currently and longer-term?\nMichael Cyprys: The mix of FREs longer-term.\nCurt Buser: You're breaking up a little bit. FRE longer-term.\nMichael Cyprys: Yes. The mix.\nCurt Buser: Okay. So look, on fee related earnings, we have been really clear in terms of growing FRE and committed to growing margins. Given guidance for this year, $440 million to $475 million and then as we go forward, the real question is I got to get 2020 done before I can really definitively answer what happens going forward. I think the right way to think about near-terms call it \u201921 is probably flattish, is slightly up, again depending upon all of these issues from an environment perspective that we talked about. And then, I think you see a real recovery and a further opportunity to really stand upon FRE and margin, again as we\u2019ve said, when the flagship funds return. And so, I think we'll be really -- but even before then, just to be more subdued but we're going to do whatever we can to drive growth in that near-term period. On net realized performance fees, I like the fact that we have $1.8 billion of accrued carry. I would like where some of our larger funds are positioned. But in the short-term, what you saw here in the first-half of this year was essentially, we're really good at focused on exits. I congratulate our teams for doing that across the board. And then pull forward, some of the carry that I thought would happen later in the year into the second quarter. And so, that's why I said realizations and carry will likely be well below first-half levels than the second-half. And look, there's always things that people are working on and we get surprised in Q4 by something kind of written or commented, but I think the more realistic place is well below kind of first-half levels for 2020. And then again, on \u201921 and \u201922, I think the engine is set up right to get us back to historical levels on much more -- $0.5 billion to $600 million of net carry per year. But when that happens, patience is the right word, especially in this world where big transactions are tough to do, and so calling timing on that is really hard. And my crystal ball just doesn't work that good right now.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may proceed.\nRobert Lee: Thank you for taking my follow-up and patience. Real quickly, Kew you kind of touched on the resiliencies so far fundraising, but may be drilling into that a little bit. Are there -- what are the different pockets where it\u2019s been more resilient than others? Is it kind of I would assume endowment, a tension or be more reticent to make your commitments compared to maybe some other investors? Just trying to get a sense on maybe the complexion of fundraising and how different parts of the marketplaces are reacting?\nKewsong Lee: Sure, Robert. Thanks for the question. So, yes, in general fundraising the environment has been more resilient. But I think in a virtual video, COVID type of a world obviously that has implications, so what are those? So, first of all, re-ups are easier than first time funds. Dealing with existing LPs is easier than trying to meet new LP's and new investment committees over video technology. And in certain asset classes, things like credit and credit opportunities, things where you can take advantage of dislocation like in our secondaries area, all areas where LPs are showing a real appetite. My general view is that for the most part the largest LPs are very sophisticated. They have a plan, they are fine tuning it, but we are not experiencing or seeing any dramatic changes in their appetite or their desire to keep allocating and keep investing in the asset class. The two last things I would state are, first, in times like these, I think our brand and our platform has particular appeal. LPs are comforted by the fact that we have enormous resources, our global platform being what it is, that we can really engage with our portfolio companies and bring full force to bear to help these companies, navigate through turbulent times. All the functional resources we have, procurement specialists, supply chain specialists, human capital experts, capital market experts, all that comes to bear at Carlyle around the world, as we're working with our portfolio companies. That is just a huge advantage to our platform that I think LPs appreciate and they become more aware of in times like this. The second thing I would say, and I'll finish with this. Taking a big step back, we're in a world where interest rates could be zero for a very long period of time. And I'm exaggerating a little for effect. Obviously, interest rates right now are going to be, in my mind, could be low for a very long period of time. In that type of an environment, there is no better way for our LPs to meet the needs of their investment objectives, than have to allocate and continue their investment into alternatives. And so from a longer-term perspective, I think the current economic environment and current outlook is such that, it further supports and reinforces the tailwinds that our asset class has. And within those tailwinds, I do believe Carlyle, with our platform and our global presence and the history and the depth of our teams, I think we're extremely well-positioned. So that makes fundraising for us easier. But, let's be clear, it's logistically more challenging, if you're trying to deal with new LPs. And obviously, first time funds are also a little bit harder.\nRobert Lee: Great. I appreciate you taking my follow up question. Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: And this now concludes our Q&A portion for today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Harris for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you all for listening, and for your time and attention this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please follow-up with Investor Relations at any point. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a nice day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We hope you're doing well and that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. So before we get started, I want to thank Glenn for his partnership and friendship over the last several years. We accomplished a lot. And I am proud of the work we did together to make Carlyle an even stronger firm. He is a culture carrier and a class act. I wish Glenn all the very best as he goes off into a life of public service. Now on to Carlyle our priorities and our results. The combined health and economic crisis is a backdrop unlike anything we have lived through. I'm proud of how everyone at Carlyle has come together to do an amazing work and job on behalf of all of our investors. And I would like to thank our entire organization for their focus and commitment during these challenging times. Despite the current environment, we're adapting well and our business continues to perform. This is evidenced by our solid second quarter results, which includes strong fund depreciation, a substantial increase in our net accrued carry, and attractive distributable earnings for our shareholders. These results reflect the hard work of all of our people to deliver on our strategic priorities which remain on track. Specifically, we continue to grow our current fund families, and will launch new investment strategies with the potential to scale. We continue to drive growth in our global credit business and build upon strong momentum in our Fortitude Re insurance platform. And we continue to prudently manage our operations to further enhance margins. Executing these priorities will enable us to grow sustainable fee-related earnings, increase our dividend on a lag basis to FRE, expand our distributable earnings over the long-term underpinned by investment performance, and invest further in corporate growth and our shareholder friendly actions with the excess capital that we generate in the future. Looking forward in the near-term, COVID and other economic and geopolitical issues are likely to create headwinds in the environment, including a material drop in M&A activity, with global announced transactions down more than 50% in the second quarter from a year ago, and notably, large transactions remaining difficult to complete. Significant disruptions in certain industries, like energy, aviation and travel, and certain consumer segments. And weakening financial conditions of many municipalities, which could have disruptive effects on the infrastructure sector as development projects slowdown, especially for public private partnership is required, for example, in our terminal rebuilding project at JFK. Our public markets have experienced a strong recovery across all types of assets. We remind ourselves that we remain in the early stages of a global pandemic and are likely facing a multiyear recovery. The potential for an uneven and uncertain recovery leads us to maintain our cautious perspective on the outlook for the real economy, as regions, sectors and asset classes are all affected differently. But please do not conflate our tonality and caution on the real economy, with our ability to remain active to drive performance in the investment world. It is certainly possible to have a cautious and prudent outlook, while remaining active and successful in our core business, as demonstrated by our second quarter results. The very uneven nature of the recovery is what provides us the opportunity to be selectively aggressive and appropriately circumspect, depending on region, asset class and industry sector. Turning to our fund performance. Thoughtful construction of our portfolios around the world helped us deliver solid investment performance in the second quarter. Fund appreciation rebounded sharply, with a corporate private equity funds appreciating 13% in the quarter, which was the main driver of our net accrued carry balance increasing by nearly 50% from last quarter. Our portfolio benefited from improved public markets, as well as tighter credit spreads and better liquidity in the capital markets. With respect to investing activities, we have found attractive new investment opportunities, notably in Asia, as well as in global growth areas like technology and healthcare. We deployed just under $6 billion of new capital in the first-half of 2020, but we expect full year deployment to be below that of the past few years. We have $73 billion in dry powder and are well-positioned to deploy capital, as opportunities emerge in the years to come. With respect to exit activities, years of hard work led to attractive sales of portfolio companies during the quarter, including, among others, Golden Goose, Eggplant and Dealogic. In addition, improved pricing and market liquidity allowed us to opportunistically complete several secondary trades across corporate private equity and real estate. We were also able to execute IPOs of several companies in the first-half of this year, from our U.S. and Asia private equity business. With respect to fundraising, we have had a good start to the year raising new capital with approximately $12.4 billion raised across the platform, with particular strength in investment solutions and global credit. While, we expect to see the firm's fundraising slowdown later in the year, the fundraising environment thus far has remained generally resilient, since the onset of the pandemic. Now a quick note on one of our most important strategic initiatives, Fortitude. In June, we completed a process that started nearly two years ago, which has resulted in Carlyle and our partners owning 97% of Fortitude Re. We're now focused on driving attractive returns on capital, maintaining prudent risk and searching for growth by acquiring additional runoff insurance blocks. Fortitude is performing well and we expect it will be an important source of growth moving forward. Finally, as I said when I started, I am proud of our people and the work we are doing. Our people and culture are the most important priority. We are more focused than ever on diversity, equity and inclusion. We are in the judgment business and diversity of thought and perspectives is what gives us our investment edge. It is critical that we continue to push forward on cultivating an inclusive culture at Carlyle and incorporating ESG in all that we do. We are committed to drive positive change not only at our firm, but also in the companies that we influence and in the communities where we work. So in summary, putting all this together, Carlyle is in great shape and very well-positioned for the future. While, of course, there will be complications and challenges, I have total confidence in our entire global team, the strength of our platform and our ability to make businesses better and create impact to drive performance with our investment activities. Let me stop there and hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser, then I'll come back and offer some final thoughts. Thanks, Curt, and again, thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our firm's strong results for the second quarter, and more broadly, we are confident we are well-positioned to navigate through these uncertain times. We remain focused on delivering attractive returns for our fund investors and growing earnings for our shareholders over the long-term. And we'll do this with one of the best teams in the world. I will say again, I am proud of how our people have adapted and excelled amidst all that is going on. That is what we do best at Carlyle, and all of us are excited for what's ahead. With that, let's turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. Hey, Glenn. It's Kew, how are you? Thanks for your question on Fortitude. So look, we're really pleased how Fortitude is progressing. And just to point out, it's a globally diversified book of liabilities at Fortitude. It's largely B2B meaning, we don't really directly originate anything from the consumer. It's definitely not model line. And from a financial perspective, we're really pleased with the fact that its capital ratio is higher than our target in regulatory thresholds. It's generating attractive call it, mid-teens greater return on equity. And with the recent raising of additional monies from our limited partners and strategic investors, we and them now control approximately 97% of this platform that, like I just mentioned is performing well. So, we're now turning to managing this platform for attractive growth and prudent growth. So, by maintaining an emphasis on policy holder surplus and making sure our risk management policies are appropriate, as you know Glenn, there are jillions of dollars of legacy liabilities out there that need to be moved off of the balance sheets of the insurance industry, because it's not efficient for them to be holding onto these types of liabilities. We are very well-positioned with this platform. It's a proven team. It's a diversified book. And now that we've been able to with our partners effectively gain control of Fortitude, we do look forward to growing vis-a\u0300-vis acquisition of these types of businesses. In terms of how do you price these books, very carefully. These are complicated books of business. I'm glad we got incredibly talented management team at this platform, and we're going to be very carefully looking at these books to understand what makes sense to acquire into Fortitude, so that we can grow. You know, Glenn.... Go ahead. Hey, Patrick, it's Kew. Thanks for the question. It's a great question because what we're noticing is that this recovery is really uneven in different regions and different industries and different sectors are being affected very differently. From a regional perspective, clearly, Asia is out ahead. And by our estimates, China probably won't even enter into a recession this year. I would also point out that part of the world, particularly China, much of their recovery has been organic with very little fiscal stimulus. So they have a lot of ammunition left to deploy from a macroeconomic perspective. But clearly, what we're seeing there, though, is consumer behavior, even there is changing with skittishness. Travel's not yet fully recovered. Consumer discretionary is not as high as it used to be. And of course, the big issue is at some point, if the rest of the world doesn't pick up, what does that have implications to China. Europe is probably doing a little bit better than we thought and dependent on country. But in general, it's correlating to the fact that they may have made more progress on the health care front than we have. And as such, we're hopeful they're not out of the woods. But we're hopeful that there's a little bit of a step in Europe. America, you see what I see, it's uneven. Certain states are doing better than others. Certain industries are certainly going to be affected more than others. And I think it's fair to say there's still more to go with respect to declaring victory as it relates to health care, but also progress on the economic recovery front. In terms of industries, look, I think it's very clear there are some industries that have been very badly hit by COVID. And quite frankly, there are others that are just moving along and even have had their growth accelerated because of COVID. Especially those are tech enabled e-commerce, collaboration-based or cloud-based. And so, so really, it's one of the reasons why having a global platform like ours, having deep industry expertise, like ours, and being in all the asset classes with really strong investment teams is truly an advantage in this type of an uncertain and uneven recovery. It's why, per my comments, we can be cautious about the real economy, but are quite selectively aggressive in the areas we like, and are going to maintain a bit of caution and prudence as it relates to those companies and industries that are going to get hit harder. So, it's very difficult to characterize or answer your question with just a very flip, monolithic statement. It is a very uncertain, uneven, very differing recovery based on region, industry sector and asset class. But that's exactly the type of situation which quite frankly, Carlyle is well-positioned to handle. Yes. Curt, that was a great answer. Michael, I'll just add maybe just two quick thoughts, which is first, we're really pleased with two quarters worth of portfolio performance. But I just want to make sure everybody appreciates. We and the industry we're by no means out of the woods, in terms of, there is still a lot to play out with respect to this recovery. So, having said that, I can't emphasize enough the importance of how well we have focused on portfolio construction. Look, while every fund will have one or two deals that aren't going away, we'd like them to, in general, our funds have been constructed very well. Case in point is our U.S. real estate portfolio, where they have virtually no exposure to office, hotel or retail sectors in that portfolio, and thus performing exceptionally well. But to Curt's point, it's a lot of hard work that's gone in over the years with respect to constructing these portfolio as well. And assuming we can stay focused and work with our management teams, and stay vigilant we're hoping to continue to navigate through this environment, because of the fact that portfolios have been constructed so well. So, look, it's a great quarter. But by no means are we going to be complacent. There's a lot more work to do, which we look forward to doing moving forward to the second-half of the year. Sure. Thanks, Bill. Look, as a sector, infrastructure is something that has been affected by COVID. Clearly, the finances of municipalities and the tax base has been hit. And there are other weird ways that implications of the current environment affect infrastructure, for instance, general contractors with working safety rules have difficulty completing projects. So clearly, certain types of projects, development projects in general are -- they're complex to begin with. They get even that much more harder to complete in this type of environment. So, I would expect to see deployment to be more of an issue broadly speaking in the infrastructure sector. Now having said that, it's the type of conditions which over the medium to longer-term present great opportunity. When you have disruptions like this and dislocations, clearly, capital is there [ph] to complete important projects and to invest in infrastructure. And so, this is one of the things where I do believe in the short-term there are issues, but over the medium to longer-term the winds at the back of the infrastructure asset class in general. With respect to your question on fundraising for some of our flagship funds, all of this is interrelated to pace of deployment and pace of exits. And to the extent that that gets pushed out a little bit, it shouldn't be a surprise that fundraising would similarly get pushed out a little bit. I think, it's too early right now to tell you precisely, exactly when we think we'll be raising money for our next cycle of funds, so stay tuned for that. But clearly, mission critical right now is just to make sure our portfolio is in good shape, is to find these opportunities as the environment and adapt to the environment to find these new opportunities. And as our pace picks up, and no doubt as our exits pick up, you'll start hearing from us much more about beginning the next leg of fundraising. On this one Robert, it's Kew. Let me start with some very high level comments and then Curt can help you a little bit with some figures. Look, we're really happy with our investment solutions team. I have to be careful, they are in the market right now raising a secondaries fund. But suffice it to say, when you have a strong team and a great track record, even in a COVID type of fundraising environment, it's a lot easier because of their ability to market their track record. So I've got a lot of confidence in that team. And I think you're exactly right. We are seeing broadly speaking opportunities in secondaries as limited partners and other owners of Alps are looking to find ways to manage liquidity and manage their portfolio, and manage allocations across their investment portfolio. So it's actually a very good time to be thinking about secondaries types of strategies, which positions our solutions segment and our Alpinvest team in a very good way. With that, let me turn it over to Curt. Yes. Thank you. So let me just give you a little bit of color. So, from a macro environmental perspective, clearly, one thing that really affects this business is our rating agency downgrades. And that came in spades last quarter. It has slowed down. And if all continues as currently right now, to Curt's earlier comments, I think we'll be in good shape. Of course, if the real economy goes in a different direction, then the downgrades accelerate, then I think that does pose headwinds for the CLO business. In terms of new issuances, but we didn't quite mention earlier or maybe we did, but we didn't highlight it. But we did partake in two recent issuances. One in Europe, one in the U.S. I would say those two does not a trend yet make. But certainly, it's encouraging that we're starting to see some life with respect to new issuances of CLO structures. An important aspect of execution in this business is, quite frankly, our team's ability to trade in and out and manage the CLO portfolios. And to that, to your question, on this front, I think our team did an amazing job over the past three, four months, trading out of certain positions and trading into higher yielding positions, with dislocations in the market, such that our positions are better yielding and performing today than they may have been during the depths of the crisis. So, hats off to the team. But to your point about what's environmental versus what are we doing. I think that's one element where having great investment teams and having the scale and the breadth that we do, really helps in this business. So, when you throw all those things together, you can see that it's a big business that we have, we think we've got a great team, the portfolios have been repositioned in a way that I think makes a lot of sense. We're all keeping an eye on rating agencies and what they're up to. And quite frankly, we are among the first if not the first in terms of being able to issue new CLOs. And hopefully, that'll pick up in the second-half of the year. But no promises on that, because I think it's not quite yet in a place where you're going to see sustained new CLO structures emerging. Hey, Bill, it's Kew. So look, your question has a lot to do with what's going to be happening with carbon and alternative forms of energy. And clearly, there is a transition going on, but this transition in our views can take a long time. And in the short-term, obviously, the energy markets right now have been very impacted, with demand destruction, as well as destruction on the supply side, and a whole bunch of geopolitical factors that are impacting conditions in the energy market. But the switchover to alternative is not as easy or as quick as people would want it to be. And so our view is, there's going to be a period of time where both traditional forms of energy, as well as new and emerging forms of energy are all both going to be viable. Now, from an investment perspective, how we play this is very dependent on values, valuations, as well as the ability of management teams that we partner with to actually drive operational improvement, irrespective of commodity prices. And suffice to say, I think in the short-term, we're in a little bit of a wait and see cautious mode, because of all the issues that are affecting the energy sector, broadly speaking. We do have a lot of optimism for finding great investment opportunities in renewables and alternative forms of energy. And we have teams that are looking at that. But clearly, this is not just a switchover. And in a snap of a finger, one whole sector is gone and another whole factor has phased in. It's going to take time. There's going to be bumps along the road. There's clearly a transition. And while that transition plays out, my personal perspective is there'll be great investment opportunities in both worlds. And it's up to our platform to try to figure out how to best navigate that. Sure, Robert. Thanks for the question. So, yes, in general fundraising the environment has been more resilient. But I think in a virtual video, COVID type of a world obviously that has implications, so what are those? So, first of all, re-ups are easier than first time funds. Dealing with existing LPs is easier than trying to meet new LP's and new investment committees over video technology. And in certain asset classes, things like credit and credit opportunities, things where you can take advantage of dislocation like in our secondaries area, all areas where LPs are showing a real appetite. My general view is that for the most part the largest LPs are very sophisticated. They have a plan, they are fine tuning it, but we are not experiencing or seeing any dramatic changes in their appetite or their desire to keep allocating and keep investing in the asset class. The two last things I would state are, first, in times like these, I think our brand and our platform has particular appeal. LPs are comforted by the fact that we have enormous resources, our global platform being what it is, that we can really engage with our portfolio companies and bring full force to bear to help these companies, navigate through turbulent times. All the functional resources we have, procurement specialists, supply chain specialists, human capital experts, capital market experts, all that comes to bear at Carlyle around the world, as we're working with our portfolio companies. That is just a huge advantage to our platform that I think LPs appreciate and they become more aware of in times like this. The second thing I would say, and I'll finish with this. Taking a big step back, we're in a world where interest rates could be zero for a very long period of time. And I'm exaggerating a little for effect. Obviously, interest rates right now are going to be, in my mind, could be low for a very long period of time. In that type of an environment, there is no better way for our LPs to meet the needs of their investment objectives, than have to allocate and continue their investment into alternatives. And so from a longer-term perspective, I think the current economic environment and current outlook is such that, it further supports and reinforces the tailwinds that our asset class has. And within those tailwinds, I do believe Carlyle, with our platform and our global presence and the history and the depth of our teams, I think we're extremely well-positioned. So that makes fundraising for us easier. But, let's be clear, it's logistically more challenging, if you're trying to deal with new LPs. And obviously, first time funds are also a little bit harder. Thanks, Rob."

            "name": "Curt Buser",
            "content": "Thanks Kew, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks, I will briefly discuss second quarter 2020 results and dig further into some key topics of interest to investors. Let's begin with our results for the quarter. Fee-related earnings were $127 million in the second quarter of 2020, with a 31% margin, slightly lower than the $133 million in the second quarter of 2019. So that result included $28 million in catch-up management fees, as compared to less than $2 million of such catch-up fees in the current quarter. Year-to-date, fee-related earnings were $256 million, which also includes the positive effect of the $30 million expense recovery, we discussed last quarter, and is ahead of the $236 million of fee-related earnings, we generated in the first-half of 2019. Fee revenues were mostly in line with the year ago after adjusting for the decrease in catch-up management fees, and the $10 million in transaction fees this quarter, as a result of closing the Fortitude transaction. Our net deferral of CLO subordinated management fees was $4 million in the current quarter, resulting in a cumulative deferral of $8 million as of June 30, up from $4 million at March 31. That said, our CLO performance is thus far stronger than we initially thought at the beginning of the pandemic and is trending favorably. Compensation was $210 million in the second quarter. And first-half 2020 cash compensation was approximately 1% higher than the first-half of 2019. We continue to closely manage our compensation expense, including equity-based compensation and the $66 million in first-half 2020 is 15% below the first-half 2019 level. G&A expense was $58 million in the second quarter, down from $80 million a year ago, reflecting lower travel and conference expenditures, as well as the recovery of certain of Fortitude transaction expenses and continued expenditure management. Net realized performance revenues were positively impacted by several attractive exits during the second quarter, as Kew discussed earlier. We produced $71 million in net realized performance revenues, largely driven by our U.S. real estate and our Europe technology funds. Year-to-date today net realized performance revenue of $119 million, is well above the $28 million generated in the first-half of 2019. That said, we expect the second-half of 2020 will likely be well below the first-half level. Overall, distributable earnings were $198 million in the second quarter, and first-half 2020 DE of $373 million was nearly $60 million higher than the first-half of 2019. DE per share was $0.53 in the quarter, $1.01 year-to-date, and we declared our quarterly $0.25 per share dividend. Strong portfolio and fund valuations drove our net accrued performance revenue balance to $1.8 billion, up 49% sequentially. Substantially, all of the increase is attributable to our appreciation in our sixth U.S. Buyout fund. Remaining fair value and public securities across our carry fund portfolio increased to 14% from 8% of total remaining fair value, as we IPO-ed to ZoomInfo and our public securities in total, appreciated more than 80% in the quarter. However, we acknowledge that volatility in either direction in the public markets could affect our accrual moving forward. Let me now shift to a discussion of the impact of Fortitude on our results and our fee-related earnings guidance. As part of the Fortitude transaction this quarter, we raised $2.1 billion of capital, upon which we will learn management fees. Fortitude is already rotated or committed to rotate nearly $4 billion into specific Carlyle funds. And we expect Fortitude to reach its $6 billion rotation target by next year. Let me now briefly explain the second quarter GAAP loss, which reverses prior GAAP earnings on Fortitude, none of which has been included in FRE or distributable earnings. For U.S. GAAP, we previously accounted for investment in Fortitude by recording our proportionate share of Fortitude's GAAP earnings, inclusive of unrealized gains and losses, resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives, related to certain reinsurance contracts. With the closing of this transaction, we now account for investments at net asset value, which still reflects a 10% appreciation above our entry price. Moving to our fee-related earnings outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we have generated $256 million in year-to-date fee-related earnings, relative to the full year 2020 range, we discussed last quarter of $400 million to $450 million. Given the strong first-half of the year and incorporated in our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our target 2020 FRE range to $440 million to $475 million. We are incrementally more comfortable than last quarter, but still cognizant of the many uncertainties that could impact results in the back-half of the year. Finally, let me summarize where we are following our corporate conversion. Following our transition to a Full C-Corporation on January 1, 2020, we have seen many of the expected benefits emerge. Our trading liquidity is nearly tripled, our top shareholders include many new high quality names, and we've been added to important indexes at Russell, MSCI and CRSP. Overall, there's been a positive set of developments. Let me now turn the call back over to Kew for some final thoughts. Glenn, it's Curt. So just, in terms of the public securities in our portfolio, it's not our practice to talk about individual securities. But as we look -- and our practice has been -- is really so, as the markets open up remain liquid and healthy, we obviously look to what's right for our respective funds and stakeholders across and look for attractive opportunities to sell. Remember, we're not forced sellers. We look for the right windows. And when the securities are trading well, and we think it's in the best interest of all stakeholders, we'll sell blocks. But, no comment on that any specific position. Hey, Dean, it's Curt. Hey, thanks for that question, really appreciate it. So, let me start with maybe a little bit of background. We have a large CLO business, where probably top three market share manages $27 billion of U.S. and European CLO funds. It's an experienced team. They've been through the wars before, including the great financial crisis and we came through that really well. We had some sub-fees back then that turned off. And we turned them all back, got them all turned back on and recovered all of those fees before. Our CLOs are performing better quarter-over-quarter. And, the performance and the trajectory is better than we initially thought at the beginning of this pandemic, probably if I knew what I knew now, I probably wouldn't even as mentioned the CLOs as much as we did in the first quarter. But one at least get that out there. I would say our team, what I'm really proud of is the activity of our team. There's been probably $3 billion of activity that the team's taken into account here in the second quarter, really to reposition the portfolio, make sure we're in the right place, manage our default rates, get the portfolio structured the right way. It's appreciated, I know on our own balance sheet, which isn't necessarily the same thing, but it's our CLOs and amount balance sheet is up about 13% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting kind of that improved performance. None of our European CLOs have turned off, while the U.S. CLOs are continuing to show some deferrals. We expect that either by the end of this year or beginning in 2021, we'll see those fees start to turn back on and possibly recoup all those deferred fees. The activity that we've had is really been really good in terms of focusing on cash. And really default rates at the end of the day is what you want to really look at. And our default rates continue to track very favorably to all kind of industry stats. And, this is amidst a time period where rating agency downgrades, at least year-to-date have far exceeded anything that's been before really in the broadly syndicated loan space. And so, this is despite all of that. So, again, I'm pleased with where we are. But, look, risks are ahead, you get a second wave, things get bad, the world changes. Obviously, what I've just said could be impacted. But right now, I'm feeling pretty good about our CLO book. So, Mike, I'll start and then Kew might add on a little bit. So, just you know, again, if we look at it, we saw really good appreciation in our corporate private equity funds, and also real strength in our global credit business. And I'll just point out that the numbers that we do share on appreciation and global credit, really just relates to the 20%, 25% of the book that is in traditional carry funds. So, it doesn't really talk about, the CLOs which make up half and I told you that that's up, a lot or some of the other areas like direct lending and the like. And again, good performance across that entire book. In corporate private equity, the public markets are incredibly volatile. We've had real fortune with respect to some of the public companies that we've been able to take public, as well as some of the existing ones they've not only performed well, but the market has appreciated by and large, and so you see real appreciation there. A lot of that is in just the areas that Kew mentioned, we're strong in healthcare, and we're strong in technology, not just in terms of our public portfolios, but that's really makes up a good percentage of the way we've constructed. And again, what I like about where we are in even real estate, our U.S. real estate team has done a fabulous job of diversifying our portfolio, don't have exposure really in any material ways to hotel, no material exposure to big office buildings, no material exposure to retail. So, we've done a nice job of really being diversified and constructing our portfolios both in the buyout business and in the real estate business. And the footprint in global credit is really starting to take off nicely. So, I think that's good. Now, the one thing I will point out is, that I mentioned in my opening remarks, is our appreciation in carry was a lot driven by not just corporate private equity, but our sixth U.S. buyout fund, which is great. And I'm glad that that's a good place to have a little bit of concentration risk, but I want everyone to be aware of that concentration risk, but it's in there. If I had to look at my own dollars, that's a good place for me to be parking my dollars with that theme. I like that theme a lot. Gerry, it's Curt. Thanks for the question. Let me just kind of level set give a little backdrop and then dig into it a little bit for you. So, as we've said, $256 million year-to-date FRE now, and that has some benefit in the first quarter of the $30 million, CTC expense recovery. And then obviously, again, with the Fortitude transaction, we recovered some expenses there. So, I would say we're naturally tracking to the middle of our range of $440 million to $475 million. But, there's a lot of things I'm really pleased with this point in time. The fee growth and the fundraising that we've seen, really in our investment solutions business, particularly at Alpinvest, has been fantastic. The Improvements that I've already talked about and our CLO platform is good. In addition, we recently activated fees on our latest aviation fund, and we also expect to activate fees on our most recent Japan fund here in the second-half of the year. Although, that will have some timing dependency upon completing the deployment of the existing fund. And we have further initiatives underway, specifically in credit, which should also give us some uplift. As everyone knows the pandemic has helped to curtail some expenses, especially travel and conference costs. And look, we're continuing to be very diligent on expense management. And so if all of that continues, and if we get some further help from transaction fees, but as Kew mentioned, I'd be careful there because large M&A deals may be tough to do this year. But if things were to pop favorably, we could end at the top end of the range. But to be clear, I wouldn't guide you really at this point in time to that middle point of our range, but we remain focused on continuing to grow FRE over the long-term. And as it relates to our margins, but we're hovering kind of 28% to 32% this year, we're at 32%, year-to-date 31% here in the quarter, and we'll bounce right around that. So yes, we've achieved that. We'll get higher in terms of the mid-30s and higher upon completion of the fundraising for our big flagship funds. As that occurs, that's when you'll see the next major step up. Until then, I would think that we'll be kind of in the same kind of ballpark zip code. And Bill, I'll just add to that, even with all those challenges and issues, fundraising first six months of this year $12.5 billion, and that's without really anything significant in corporate private equity, really just showing the strength of fundraising in global credit and solutions, and more to come. So, we're always having activity from a fundraising perspective. It just may not be at those super or larger amounts with the flagship funds. So, thanks Kew. The thing that I've always been really pleased about, our investment solutions business is its performance. So, if you think about just our most recent the prior secondaries fund, for example, which was fully invested, and it's a Fund part [ph] 2011, it's 18% net IRR. If you look at Page 27 of our materials in the earnings release, the Alpinvest funds on a net basis -- and these are primary, secondary and co-investment blends to a 12% net IRR. I mean it's just really good performance for these products. The investors really appreciate it. It's allowed us to scale this business. And you're right, that's contributing to a real nice uptick in fee-related earnings, going from call it $6 million in Q2 last year to call it $12 million this quarter and they're not done. The other thing that I like about this business is, when we bought it, we didn't buy the embedded carry. And these are European style waterfall's, which means it takes a while for that carry to come into and be in and really be attributed to us. So, while you'll see low net carry numbers coming off of this business, because most of that's going out to other owners. As we move forward, our percentage of that will increase and that will make this also a stronger driver of DE going forward. Now, again, this business is not going to be like a corporate private equity business, but it will be a bigger component. And I like its increasing contribution to our overall platform. So, let me take a shot at these answers and thank you for the good questions. So the CLOs, just to kind of remind everybody, we are in about a $120 million a year annually on management fees out of the CLO business. So it's an important part of our business. Again, it's a $27 billion AUM business for us. So it's significant. Now, about two-thirds of that number roughly speaking, are subordinated fees that could be shut off. And so therefore, the concern at the beginning of the year was that could obviously have a significant impact, if rating downgrades were significant. That's proven not to be the case thus far. And so I'm feeling good about that. That has obviously helped us in terms of thinking about expectation for the balance of this year. But as I said earlier, there's a lot of other things to think about, the expectation. The Fortitude transaction coming through obviously helps. And as we look forward, our Alpinvest business is performing very well and that's done great. And so all of these things together has helped me, think through kind of the increasing our range, from where we were from the $400 million to $450 million to the $440 million to $475 million. On top of this, the comments really around -- I get a part of that was what drives, and again, it's these factors that they kind of get us there. And so, hopefully that's responsive to your question. But I just would caution people that things, there's a lot of uncertainties that continue to pop up in 2020. And so, we just have to be continue to be cautious while actually effectively executing what we do. Sure, Dan. Go ahead, please. So this year, we've done about $12.5 billion year-to-date. Early in the year we indicated $20 billion, that's still possible. I don't want you to put that down as a hard number. We just told, the second-half could be lighter. That's still a possible number for this year. And somewhere kind of hovering in that high teens to that level is what the business generally will be doing on an annual basis prior to the super cycle coming back in. Sure. So generally speaking, the funds that we have been raising from a fee rate perspective have been either equivalent to, or in some cases slightly better than their predecessor funds. So, the movement that you see up or down generally have to do with mix. And also the other key factor is when you get -- the new funds also coming in and you get the big step up from a larger fund, at full committed capital levels, that helps. And then you need to also take into account some places in particular our global credit business. Those fees tend to be more on invested capital rather than committed capital. And so as you invest more, you earn more in management fees, obviously, which makes sense. And that from an operating margin perspective, that is obviously very helpful because you're generally not adding the same type of expenses to the equation as you are from a management fee perspective. So, I would not get too focused on the effective rates at this time, because there's a lots of gives and takes. But the overall piece that I really would think about is that generally on a like-for-like basis, we're not seeing any decreases in terms. The terms are generally flat to better. I guess, I wouldn't call quarantine or pandemic or uncertainties buttoned up. As Kew mentioned, I think we're still at the early stages of kind of recovery and seeing how things really play out. But what I do like is our core business. Our core business model 98% of our fee earning AUM is not subject to redemption. 90% of our fee revenues are long-term oriented. And that's all good. And then with respect to Fortitude itself, that Fortitude transaction changes essentially the dynamics around how we operate. So you saw the gap charge. But from an investment perspective, that business is well. It's marked 10% above what we have carried for. Its performance is right on track. Things are going well. With this closing, there's $2 billion of capital we raised, which will earn management fees on. You only saw one month here in the second quarter from that. So that's additive going forward. And then you have essentially as they continue to rotate capital in, essentially about $4 billion about now and are close to either committed or slotting in and then get up to the $6 billion, we'll see further uptake as that all rotates in. And then if we're fortunate to grow that business, I would expect further growth from said growth. So, keep in mind as we sell, that's our goal here. Our goal is not to in these closed end fund structures, which is kind of driving 90% of our revenues, our goal is to invest it, and then to sell it at a multiple and make money for our investors. And so you should always expect that our business to see outflows. It's not redemptions. Again, 98% of our fee earning AUM is not subject to redemption, but it's from realizations. And so, we had good realizations this year, and that's a big part of which we'll see. And obviously, other things that can contribute to that are some, step downs when you move around fee earning AUM and you move from the committed to the post the investment period, and so you can see a step down at that time. But generally most of the activity is from exits. And then inflows are obviously as we're raising capital around it and that's really has been a big piece. You also see some inflows as we activate for fee earning AUM, so as we activate funds that we have raised, which would be otherwise included in total AUM but not included in fee earning AUM, until we activate them, and so they'll come in there. And then some of the funds which are dependent upon us investing, they'll flow into fee earning AUM as we invest that capital. So those are what really accounts for some of the ups and downs in the roll forward. So, I think you're asking about the performance fees currently and longer-term? You're breaking up a little bit. FRE longer-term. Okay. So look, on fee related earnings, we have been really clear in terms of growing FRE and committed to growing margins. Given guidance for this year, $440 million to $475 million and then as we go forward, the real question is I got to get 2020 done before I can really definitively answer what happens going forward. I think the right way to think about near-terms call it '21 is probably flattish, is slightly up, again depending upon all of these issues from an environment perspective that we talked about. And then, I think you see a real recovery and a further opportunity to really stand upon FRE and margin, again as we've said, when the flagship funds return. And so, I think we'll be really -- but even before then, just to be more subdued but we're going to do whatever we can to drive growth in that near-term period. On net realized performance fees, I like the fact that we have $1.8 billion of accrued carry. I would like where some of our larger funds are positioned. But in the short-term, what you saw here in the first-half of this year was essentially, we're really good at focused on exits. I congratulate our teams for doing that across the board. And then pull forward, some of the carry that I thought would happen later in the year into the second quarter. And so, that's why I said realizations and carry will likely be well below first-half levels than the second-half. And look, there's always things that people are working on and we get surprised in Q4 by something kind of written or commented, but I think the more realistic place is well below kind of first-half levels for 2020. And then again, on '21 and '22, I think the engine is set up right to get us back to historical levels on much more -- $0.5 billion to $600 million of net carry per year. But when that happens, patience is the right word, especially in this world where big transactions are tough to do, and so calling timing on that is really hard. And my crystal ball just doesn't work that good right now."

I'd now like to like to hand the conference over to your host Mr. Daniel Harris. Please go ahead, sir.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website.  We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release.  Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. For the first quarter, we generated $129 million in fee-related earnings and $175 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $0.48. We have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share.  To ensure participation by all those on the call, please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue for any additional follow-ups.  And with that, let me turn the call over to our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Youngkin.\nGlenn Youngkin: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. To describe the current global health and economic crisis as unprecedented feels wholly inadequate. The human toll is tragic, and the economic damage has been extensive. I want to start by thanking all of the health care professionals and frontline workers helping to protect and heal our communities. Our thoughts and prayers are foremost with the people and families across the globe that have been and continue to be impacted by this pandemic. As the situation has continued to unfold, our top priorities at Carlyle have been and remain the health and safety of our people and their families as well as supporting our portfolio in every way we can and ensuring that we can continue to deliver for investors and all stakeholders by mobilizing our extensive global platform and every resource at our disposal.  Carlyle was in a position of strength leading into this crisis, which has provided us great stability. The pandemic has shocked the world over the past 4 months, but we've been able to mobilize quickly and decisively. Thanks to the great work and continuity across our entire global platform. Kew and I are incredibly proud of the Carlyle team. We have found an even greater level of both collaboration and commitment and compassion and service.  The first quarter of 2020 started off exceptionally well with our 2019 momentum continuing. At the firm level, our outlook for the year was developing as envisioned, with solid earnings growth, substantial dry powder from our $110 billion fundraising campaign, our successful transition to a C-corp and a sturdy balance sheet. In addition, our portfolios were in good shape and performing well with strong investment and exit pipelines. In the first quarter, we were able to execute several IPOs, secondary trades and announced transactions. Including the IPO of One Medical and the sale of Sundyne from our US Buyout portfolio, block trades in China Literature and MicroPort in our Asia buyout portfolios and numerous sales from our U.S. Real Estate funds. Fundraising momentum continued into the early part of the year, with $7.5 billion of new capital raised in the first quarter. So while the pandemic has shocked the world, Carlyle was sturdy and steady going into the storm.  Upon the onset of the crisis in January, our China team took decisive action, which set the precedent for our other regions and accelerated our decision-making process in Europe and the United States. In March, we quickly moved all of our U.S. and Europe employees to work remotely. We then activated our business continuity plans and to date have seen near-perfect execution. Early on, Carlyle's investment teams were active, stress testing every equity and credit position in our portfolio and making decisions for each asset based on varying levels of business disruption. And One Carlyle, our global resource platform, has been an action like never before, using all of our capabilities to provide support for our portfolio companies. We've also been leveraging many of the company's unique offerings, particularly in health care and technology to help provide solutions to the most pressing issues as many of our companies have also been upfront in the fight against the virus. For example, PA Consulting has done great work coordinating efforts to source ventilators for patients in the U.K., and most recently, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics announced breakthrough work to rapidly deploy antibody tests.  With that said, it is clear that the next few months and quarters will be challenging. It is our view that the recovery will progress in fits and starts and will take longer than what we all would have hoped. With this in mind, we remain fully committed to our top priorities, but also to our strategy as long-term investors and partners to our portfolio companies and our LPs. We're planning for and preparing for a wide range of outcomes, and we do remain in a strong position with $74 billion of dry powder, $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and $525 million in capacity on our revolver, a global team and platform that are stronger than ever and deep experience across Carlyle as we have previously operated successfully through economic, financial and market crisis.  There's no doubt that we have much work to do, and I'll hand it over to Kew to walk you through some of our thoughts for the future. I, again, want to reiterate that our leadership team is active and focused on driving value for our fund investors and shareholders. And we thank you for your commitment to us, and we assure you that the Carlyle team remains equally committed to all of you.  With that, let me turn the call over to Kew.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. And let me echo our sentiment of gratitude towards our health care professionals and frontline workers serving our communities around the world. I'm going to discuss our views on the impact of the current situation on our business, and after some financial commentary from Curt, we'll wrap up with thoughts on the future.  As Glenn noted, Carlyle was well positioned before the crisis. Our momentum has slowed but not stalled. We believe there could be a continuing and significant impact from this pandemic. The severity and duration of various health and economic issues and the shape and nature of the recovery are still unknowns, and therefore, all of this will take longer to play out than not. Our experience managing through disruptions and cycles in the past inform us of our path now. We are taking a cautionary stance in maintaining a balanced and patient perspective. By doing so, we are confident that over time, our shareholders as well as public pensions, endowments and foundations will benefit as we use our well-positioned global platform to drive value from our existing $143 billion of assets in the ground and put our $74 billion of dry powder to work towards attractive opportunities as they emerge around the world across various sectors in all asset classes.  We'd like to share our thoughts on how our business and the industry could be affected by this crisis in an effort to be as transparent and helpful as possible. So let me address 3 important dimensions: deal activity, valuations and fundraising.  First, the volume of traditional private equity investment is likely to decline significantly in the short term. Investors will step back and assess the real economic impact of the pandemic on businesses, their prospects and valuations. In our experience, financial buyers mark-to-market faster than sellers, and thus, there is likely to be reduced traditional deal activity for several quarters or more until some of this uncertainty abates. The majority of our $74 billion of dry powder was recently raised, we can afford to be patient and disciplined, and we look forward to many attractive opportunities, but it will take some time.  Similarly, traditional exit activity will be put on hold as IPOs are delayed and sales processes are put on pause until M&A activity and more confidence returns. Keep in mind, our fund structures do not have liquidity risk, and at Carlyle, we are never forced sellers and have the ability to hold assets through periods of market volatility and continue to build value in our companies and portfolio. We believe investment activity will recover at different rates and vary by asset classes, regions and sectors as the path of recovery becomes clearer. One bright spot is that credit deployment has already seen a significant increase as several of our funds are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on current market dislocations, particularly in credit opportunities, distressed and special situations. In addition, we are starting to see interesting new opportunities in Asia and in our secondaries business. And certain global sectors benefiting from structural changes, like technology and health care may present opportunities earlier than more cyclical sectors.  Certain industry sectors may experience more than just a short-term impact. Notably, the energy sector is undergoing a significant structural dislocation on both the supply and demand side that is likely to take more than a few quarters to play out. However, over the long term, we have more than $4 billion in dry powder to invest into new opportunities across our energy-related funds and what could be attractive valuations.  Let me now turn to the second important factor and speak to valuation challenges that could last beyond the quarter. As the full impact of global shutdowns and an uncertain recovery becomes more evident, there could be additional pressure on fund valuations. Our interim marks are important, the more significant driver of realized earnings in the future is the improvement in growth and performance of our portfolio companies over the long term, which is why one of our major priorities as an investment organization is to focus on our invested assets and drive value creation at our portfolio companies. We thought it would be helpful to share with you the diversification and how some of our most important portfolios are constructed in aggregate.  With respect to the remaining fair value of our entire corporate private equity portfolio, we have very little direct consumer retail exposure at about 5%. Relatively low exposure to commercial aviation at approximately 7%. We have very little energy exposure at 2% and less than 1% exposure to lodging and hotels. Finally, only 7% of the remaining fair value of our corporate private equity portfolio is in publicly listed securities.  Similarly, in our United States Real Estate portfolio, which represents far and away our largest holdings of real estate assets, we had only 2% of our U.S. Real Estate fair value invested in hotels, 2% in traditional office and only 1% in retail. Our energy exposure is largely concentrated in separate funds, which account for approximately $13 billion of fair value or roughly 9% of total firm-wide fair value. The segregation of these energy focused funds, which is a conscious design of our investment platform, is important because the performance and carry potential of our corporate private equity and other carry funds is independent of the results from these energy funds. Without a doubt, we will have some issues and troubles in each of our funds that will be problematic and need to be worked through. But our diversification and the way we have constructed our portfolios gives us confidence that over the long term, we are well positioned to continue driving performance and significant value creation. And having done so in the past, we believe our limited partners have come to appreciate our ability to deliver relative outperformance compared to public market indices.  Finally, let me address fundraising which, in aggregate, is likely to slow down in the short term as investors try to understand the current environment and their own specific needs. LPs are assessing the impact of this crisis on their portfolios and evaluating the denominator impact, allocation targets and liquidity schedules in light of market volatility. Our experience is that their pace of new commitments will slow down temporarily while they continue to fund their existing commitments. Having said this for the industry as a whole, some LPs will be more aggressive about continuing to lean into alternatives, and there will be opportunities to raise capital for tactical strategies in the near term to take advantage of dislocations, particularly in the credit asset class.  In the short term, we are in good shape as we have just completed a multiyear $110 billion fundraising campaign. And over the medium- to longer-term and what we have great confidence in, is that fund investors will ascribe increased value to relationships with their most trusted, well-resourced and experienced partners. We believe this positions Carlyle well for the potential to gain more wallet share from our limited partners as the fundraising environment stabilizes in the future.  Given these comments with regards to deal activity, valuations and fundraising, it's understandable there is more uncertainty with respect to near-term financial results, and we feel it is therefore prudent to remove prior guidance and for the moment, refrain from providing comprehensive guidance for the future. We have a strong handle on our business and the factors affecting us but believe it is appropriate to take our time to better understand the nature and path of recovery in the real economy and markets. To be clear, removal of our guidance should not be interpreted as anything other than our continued desire to build long-term credibility with our shareholders.  Before I hand the call off to Curt, let me conclude with this. The private capital industry has experienced attractive growth over the past several decades. This trend is likely to continue as private markets will remain an important source of capital and play an important role as the economy recovers. With every investment we make, we drive value creation and serve the pensions, endowments and foundations that will need our performance now more than ever.  Let me turn the call over to Curt to go through our financial results, and then I'll come back with some final thoughts. Over to you, Curt.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Kew. In my remarks, I will briefly discuss first quarter 2020 results and then frame some of the important issues we're watching. Let's begin with our results for the quarter. Fee-related earnings were $129 million with a 33% margin, up from $103 million in the first quarter of 2019. We recovered $30 million of litigation costs in connection with the final settlement of the Carlyle Capital Corp. Litigation, which is included as a reduction of G&A expense. Excluding this recovery, FRE would have been $99 million with a 25% margin, which reflects some specific revenue shortfalls that developed in March due to the pandemic related to CLOs and transaction fees, both of which, I will comment on further in a minute.  Net realized performance revenues began the year on plan with several carry-producing exits, which then slowed as the crisis emerged globally in March. Overall, pretax distributable earnings were $175 million in the first quarter compared to $101 million in the first quarter of 2019. With markets still unstable and exit slowing, the pace of realizations over the next few quarters is expected to slow, and quarterly realized performance revenues are likely to be below this quarter for the next several quarters.  Our valuations were lower in the quarter. Our corporate private equity funds depreciated 8% in the first quarter compared to the MSCI All Country World index decline of 23% over the same period. Real estate was generally stable, down 1% in the quarter, while our natural resources funds, which have a large energy component depreciated 22%. Investment Solutions appreciated 1% in the quarter, reflecting the standard 1 quarter lag in portfolio valuation for this segment.  As a result, in total, net accrued performance revenue on our balance sheet declined to $1.2 billion from $1.7 billion at year-end. It's important to note that our accrued clawback remained insignificant and unchanged from year-end. And while it's possible that our net accrued carry could further decrease should values continue to decline, we do not expect a material change in our accrued clawback.  As Kew said, given the very high level of uncertainty for the rest of 2020, we are not able to provide comprehensive forward guidance at this time. But let me frame certain aspects of our fee revenues and expenses. Starting with fee revenues. One key point is that approximately 98% of our management fees arise from fee-earning AUM located in closed-end fund structures with no redemption risk. Furthermore, approximately 90% of our fee revenues are from traditional closed-end, long-dated funds for which our fees are highly predictable and stable and have very little exposure to fund valuations. While we have $12.5 billion of pending fee-earning AUM that is not yet activated fees, further management fee growth relies on new vintages or new carry fund families. To the extent fundraising is delayed, growth of this revenue base will be similarly delayed.  With regards to the other 10% of fee revenue, we earned about $120 million annually from management fees on our CLOs in the form of base fees and subordinated fees. Subordinated fees represent about 70% of this revenue base. Credit rating downgrades across the industry may cause the subordinated fees to be deferred. These deferred fees can be subsequently turned back on and recaptured based on the actual default rates and cash returns within the CLO structures.  During this quarter, we did not recognize $4 million of subordinated fees, which were deferred. If the rating agencies further downgrade bonds and loans in which the CLOs have invested, it's likely that CLOs across the industry will experience revenue deferrals over the course of this year. During the great financial crisis, we saw the majority of CLOs across the industry shut off subordinated fees, but 100% of our CLO subordinated fees were turned back on, and all of our deferred revenue was recovered.  Finally, transaction and advisory fees generated $53 million of fee revenue in 2019 and are likely to trend lower with a slower pace of closed investments. Shifting now from revenues to expenses. Cash compensation was $204 million in Q1 2020, generally in line with the first quarter of 2019. In a given year, a little over half of total cash compensation and benefits expense is due to variable year-end compensation. We will actively manage this level based on actual results for the year. We have control over our professional fees, travel and entertainment and general and administrative expenses, which in some cases, like travel, will be lower; and in other cases, where we'll even more tightly manage expenditures.  When you put all of this together, it's really hard to say where exactly our 2020 distributable earnings will land. Forecasting FRE is more doable. But given the current economic uncertainties, we are currently estimating a wide range of $400 million to $450 million for our 2020 FRE outlook.  Two last items. First, we continue to manage equity-based compensation expense and the $32 million in equity-based compensation expense compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2019, represented a 19% decline. Second, as Glenn noted, we are in a strong liquidity position and accordingly declared a dividend of $0.25 per share in line with our planned fixed dividend of $1 annually.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Kew.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you, Curt. Let me end with a few thoughts on the future. The crisis has slowed, but by no means stalled the momentum we've established coming into this year. Our focus has not wavered, and we are uninterrupted in our work of driving value in our companies. Our 2020 financial results will reflect our solid start to the year and the relative stability of our fee earnings as we now adapt to emerging opportunities and trends and take advantage of our strong position to deliver on 2021 and beyond. To that end, our investment strategy remains on track. We are a global investment firm with a long-term orientation, seeking to generate attractive and consistent performance for our investors, who are relying on us now more than ever.  We are focused on generating as much value as possible from our existing and highly diversified portfolio for our fund investors and our shareholders. We are also patiently investing our dry powder and believe many attractive investment opportunities will emerge in the years to come. Our business strategy remains on track. We are growing our best-positioned and most scalable investment funds, managing our expenses prudently and finding the right opportunities to selectively expand and diversify our business. Our financial objectives are unchanged. We are focused on driving FRE each year, generating significant distributable earnings over the medium to long term, which, in combination with FRE, provides for a long-term attractive earnings growth profile, continuing to control equity dilution over time and protecting and increasing our dividend over time on a lagging basis to our FRE as it grows. No one could have predicted this pandemic but we had already been preparing our organization and investing with the mindset that we were late cycle in the economy.  Over the last three decades, we have become an industry leader, given our ability to build better businesses in partnership with great management teams through all sorts of economic and market cycles. We have confidence that our platform positions us well to navigate through and adapt to a new environment as we continue to find attractive investment opportunities and fund our strategies by raising significant amounts of new capital. We thank you for your support and partnership and hope that all of you stay safe and healthy.  With that, let turn the call over to the operator and take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. \nWilliam Katz: I hope everyone is safe and healthy on your end as well. Just maybe Curt for yourself, relatively wide range on the FRE. I was wondering if you might be able to help us sort of frame the upside, downside of that range, what some of the underlying assumptions might be either micro or company-specific that would range it between the $400 million to $450 million?\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Bill, for your question, and good to talk to you this morning. So first, I just want to reiterate, we remain really focused on growing fee-related earnings and also improving our FRE margin over time. We have a great handle on our business. But even with having a great handle on our business, there's still much that we don't know about how the pandemic will play out and how it will impact us. So for example, I don't know what further downgrades to expect from the rating agencies and how that could potentially affect our CLO subordinated fees, as I described in my opening remarks. I'm hopeful that it has really no material effect. And you can kind of see it was only $4 million here in the first quarter. But if you look back to the great financial crisis, obviously, it had a bigger impact. . That said, there are a lot of great aspects of our business model that clearly help. 98% of our fee-earning AUM has no redemption risk. 90% of our fee revenues is from predictable and stable management fee streams. And our LP defaults have historically been nonexistent. So we remain committed to growing FRE. But right now, it's hard really to kind of exactly see how this plays out. And we have a lot of good levers. And right now, I think it's the right thing to kind of appropriately set this in the $400 million to $450 million. Bill, it is a wide range. I wish I could give you much more precision, but it's just too early in the year to give you that kind of precision.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hope you're all healthy. I just wanted to start with the credit marks. With a 21% mark for your credit carry funds, I wanted to see what were the marks in the businesses that are not in carry funds, like CLOs, direct originations? And I'm not sure if you include aviation and structured credit or not, but I was interested in that mark, too.\nCurtis Buser: Craig, thanks for your answer. So as again, as we think about our global credit carry funds, the 21% is just the carry funds. And the carry funds are about 25%, and that number is inclusive of the aviation business. But it doesn't include the direct lending. It doesn't include the other aspects of the business, including the CLOs. The CLOs fundamentally really don't drive off of their marks, right? They drive off of the default rates within the underlying CLOs. And so really not as relevant. I need to be a little careful about disclosure around the BDC at this time because it is a separate public company and hasn't separately released its earnings. The key thing in that business is managing those portfolios over time. Key thing is managing default rates and how it all plays out over time, we remain really optimistic about it. Lots of great opportunities to come. And I think that you got to put that 21%, clearly, in perspective, it has a high energy concentration. That's from our energy mezz funds and so I wouldn't let that distort the whole thing, and that's why we only give you the carry funds because it's the only thing that's really comparable here. I don't know if Kew or Glenn, there's anything you'd like to add to that.\nKewsong Lee: Craig, it's Kew. Let me just give you a little bit more color, and Curt did a good job of laying out the numbers and making a big distinction as to the performance of carry versus the other strategies we have in the portfolio. And remember, credit is a platform-based strategy. With respect to the marks that you saw, most of it, a large portion was driven in our Energy Mezzanine strategy, which several quarters ago, we've already announced, it's not a continuing strategy of Carlyle. The other main driver of the marks within our distressed business, which had a little bit of energy exposure. In the one fund that we can talk about is performance, which is a mature and fully invested fund. I can tell you the gross IRRs of that fund even after these marks is in excess of 20%. And the newer fund about half its capital is still available to invest. And I think it's fair to say distressed is one area where there's lots of great opportunities right now. And so having that dry powder is terrific. So if you look at that with some color, a lot of the marks are driven by what I would call strategies that we're not really going to be fundraising to into the future. And the other major driver was in the business, which actually has more opportunities now than ever before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKenneth Worthington: I wanted to ask about the implications of both lower rates and the impact of coronavirus on your recent acquisitions. So you pursued both Apollo Aviation and Fortitude Re. What is the outlook for earnings from both of these businesses? And I don't know if I'm completely off the reservation, so please tell me if I am. But is there any risk of write-down from either of these investments due to the market actions that we're seeing out there?\nKewsong Lee: Ken, it's Kew. I'll take on both of those. It's actually a great question. And the short answer, I think, the headline answer to your question on write-downs, no. But I think it's important to go through each one of them. And so if you don't mind, I will peel into each and give you a little bit of color. . Let's start with Fortitude first. It's well capitalized. We have an excess capital ratio of 210%, which is far above the 150% target ECR ratio. Our adjusted book value is up significantly from when we did this deal 1.5 years, 2 years ago. And the ROEs of the underlying business are strong and, let's call it, in the low to mid-teens. The biggest issue in the industry, and quite frankly, for Fortitude, is the impact on -- from all the volatility and the rate movements we've all experienced over the past several months. And I think it's really important to note Fortitude did a tremendous job of putting into place hedges and risk management maneuvers, which really insulated the capital in this business. In particular, when we first announced this transaction, we entered into hedges on interest rates, hedges to help us with our asset liability duration mismatch and hedges, which protect against spread volatility.  And when you throw all of that together, we have a company which has weathered the volatility that you've seen remarkably well, and we find the company in a position of strength and capital preservation, which is really fortuitous and really an advantageous position for that platform to be in this current environment. The reserves are performing as expected. It does not have any material COVID-19 risk, particularly from business interruption. The carve-out is proceeding on plan. We expect it to really be fully separated from AIG sometime this year. And 2 last points, we do expect the closing of an important element of this transaction, which is capital that we raised from our limited partners and some strategic partners to effectuate ownership of up to 97%, close to 100% of this business from AIG. That transaction is expected to close, I'd say, sometime by mid-year.  With respect to the investment management aspect of Fortitude, the rotation that we talked about in previous calls of rotating assets over into Carlyle from an investment management perspective remains on track, and we're quite pleased with the strategic partnership that we have with Fortitude. So I think in Fortitude's case, we're in pretty good shape as we sit here today.  Let me talk to aviation, which is the second aspect of your question, and I apologize for the length of the answer, but it's an important question that you asked. Look, this business is performing really well. In 2019, it generated approximately $40 million of revenue and over $10 million of FRE to Carlyle. And the acquisition has met or exceeded our expectations. There is fundraising going on for aviation. So I want to be careful what I say, but let me just state, it's off to a great start, and these are closed-end carry funds with locked-up capital.  Now of course, there's tremendous disruption that's occurred in the sector. Travel, flights being curtailed, airlines taking plans off of -- out of capacity, canceling orders, et cetera. This new fund that we've raised or in the process of finishing raising is a source of critically important financing to this market, and we believe it's really well positioned, and the timing is quite good. We have about $1 billion of dry powder to help finance important businesses to this vital sector for our economy. So we're hard at work managing this portfolio. The team is doing -- going beyond the call of duty, working with our airline partners, helping them keep aircraft on lease. As we sit here today, we feel very good about our aviation business and the future prospects in that company for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerry O'hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Glenn, you mentioned activating a business continuity plan as you kind of start to identify some of the issues that began to evolve early in the quarter. Perhaps you could give a few examples of how that actually works structurally or perhaps some of the steps that we're taking to shore up portfolio companies identify risk or just kind of assess the...\nGlenn Youngkin: Great. Jerry, thanks for the question. So first of all, the primary step of transitioning was to get everybody working remotely and stood up. And so over the course of the January, February and March period, we had 100% of our workforce move to remote working. And that's over more than 30 offices on 6 continents, and that was a big step, and it worked extraordinarily well. I think in the first week of activity, we had 40,000 video conference calls.  The second big step was to move through the portfolio aggressively and really triage. And we categorize the businesses into and real estate assets and energy companies and loan positions into 1 of 3 buckets. A bucket that it was going to be -- going to have a limited impact from all of this. A bucket that it was going to have a much more severe impact and a bucket that it was going to have potentially a large impact. And I do think that, that first amount of work allowed us to really focus on liquidity and where we needed to spend our time.  And then the second -- the final big area of activity was how can we use the global resources at Carlyle in order to really support these companies. And just a couple of examples. Early on, we convened a global meeting with all of the chief information officers of the big companies, and helped them figure out how do we, in fact, help you transition into a remote working environment. We also did an enormous amount of work in helping kind of clean up some supply chains that were interrupted. We had a number of companies that literally couldn't source key components to their manufacturing process. And so the global Carlyle resource team went to work to help people source components. And then, of course, we were supporting a number of these companies that were bringing some really innovative ways to support frontline virus initiatives. One Medical, all of a sudden was able to provide remote COVID-19 diagnostics for people, and it wasn't in place beforehand. So it was across the whole portfolio, but the very first steps, we're getting people stood up, then the heavy work on the portfolio and then using the big broad Carlyle platform in order to support each and every one of the companies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Appreciate all your realistic outlook and transparency upfront. So I guess the question I have is on LP behavior. And I wonder if you could talk to it from the standpoint of commitments to current funds, appetite as they re-undertake an underfunded position and think about asset allocations? And then lastly, on just the concept of dedicated funds in general. And that's a private equity and credit comment of -- I understand the good and the bad, they self-select in. But any given dedicated funds could have ups and downs, and it kind of highlights it. I'm just curious if there's any rethink on your or the LP parts there?\nGlenn Youngkin: Okay. Glenn, thanks for that question. Let me get started, but I have a feeling, Kew will be able to jump in and provide some thoughts as well. So first, the LP universe, the fund investor universe has broadly gone into this pandemic in much better shape than they went into the great financial crisis. And the primary reason is the great financial crisis educated a lot of investors on how to manage liquidity, especially and particularly how important their private capital portfolios are. And in fact, coming out of the great financial crisis, it was the private capital portfolios that performed extraordinarily well that enabled many of these investors to get back ahead of some losses that they had had in other parts of their portfolio. . What we hear from our investors is, of course, different across the whole set. But in general, as Kew mentioned in his comments, they're catching their breath a bit, and they're making sure they understand what they have in their portfolio, but some of them really are leaning in. And so we do see investment processes continuing, commitments continuing. As Kew said, I think the front end of that is in credit. We also see it in secondaries. I would call those sectors that are really able to take advantage of the dislocation. The next area of interest from investors is what's going to come during the rebound. And I think we're starting to see some real interest in investing into that phase. But as Kew said, we do think that traditional private equity-type investing will be at the back end of this recovery. And investors recognize that.  My final comment, and then I'll invite Kew in for something -- for a comment. My final comment is the most important aspect of this has been the intimacy that we share with our investors. And one of the things that, in fact, happened during this period is we were very quick to inform them where the portfolios are, very quick to interact with them on the status of the various portfolio companies. And I think that's the long-term relationship that really does underpin their confidence in having us as one of their core, core, core private capital partners. Kew, anything else you'd add?\nKewsong Lee: Yes, Glenn, that was really good. Two or 3 additional points, Glenn. First, obviously, we've been in very close contact with all of our LPs, as Glenn just mentioned. And we have, in fact, issued some significant capital calls and all of them have been met with no problems. So just you know, we have been functioning. We have been issuing capital calls, and those calls are being met.  Second, look, every crisis is different, and who knows how this will play out versus the GFC. For whatever it's worth, if you go back to the great financial crisis, similar question were asked of us. And we can tell you in hindsight, there were all capital calls were, in essence, met and no material, if any significant defaults occurred with respect to our funding base with respect to LP commitments.  And then finally, with respect to your question on dedicated funds. Look, this is an interesting question. And different LPs are set up differently, and some have different ways of allocating and prefer focused strategies for their portfolios. But also for us, it's a conscious way that we've designed our investment platform, recognizing that certain strategies are distinct and have their own inherent characteristics. But the importance that having energy and dedicated funds brings out in periods like this, is that the volatility of those funds does not help nor impair the ability of our other funds to drive value and get to carry. Because remember, the way funds work with their press and their hurdle is its cumulative and aggregated rates of return across all deals in that fund. So to the extent you have overexposure to certain sectors or deals that take the fund, the performance overall down, that fund would be in jeopardy of not getting to carry.  So it's a very important point, Glenn, that you just touched on. And so by having inherently more volatile strategies in more focused funds, we think it does two things. One, it helps our LPs from an allocation perspective because many LPs do want those types of strategies broken out. But second, from our investment performance, but more importantly, our ability to deliver distributable earnings in the future. It does have the effect of insulating our more traditional strategies from the downside and upside from these more volatile strategies. So hopefully, Glenn, that gives you a little bit more color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was just hoping you could dive in a little bit more on the 3 funds that fell out of carry in the quarter. Maybe you could just give us a sense if that's due to a single or a handful of portfolio companies? And any color could share around those 3 funds that fell out. And if you can remind us maybe of a time in the past for some of your funds sell-out of carry, and eventually went back in, how often has that happened? And if you look back in time, which funds, if any, in history at Carlyle did not actually go back into carry? And why was that the case?\nCurtis Buser: Mike, it's Curt. I'll start, and then one of the other guys and also join in. So just to be clear, in the quarter, I would say that we had 4 significant funds fall out of carry: Our Europe Buyout fund, the fourth version of that; our international energy buyout fund, that's the first version of that; our long-dated fund and then credit opportunities fund. Now the point isn't always ever where is something marked today, it's obviously where it performs over time. And each of these have different strategies. They're very unique. But we are working hard on all of them to position them back into carry. And if you go back to the great financial crisis, we had the same thing happened. Our fourth US Buyout fund fell out of accrued carry. Well, guess what? I am really happy that I was invested in that fourth US Buyout fund because it did great.  Also, our fifth U.S. Real Estate fund sell-out of a crude carry during that time, and it came back and has done well. And it's in accrued carry to even at this point in time. So these funds -- look, the energy implication on international energy, I mean you understand that story. The long-dated funds got a long time for this to play out. It's actually still deploying capital. Our credit opportunities fund is incredibly well positioned. And it's also in a place where there's a little bit more capital to deploy, but also as the nature of that portfolio over time, we like it. And our Europe Buyout portfolio, it will have some challenges, but its diversity in terms of structure is good. So hopefully, that solves -- answers your question. I don't know if Glenn or Kew, anything you want to add. .\nGlenn Youngkin: No, No, Curt, you did a really good job there.\nKewsong Lee: That was pretty good, Curt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: You mentioned the kind of bucketing of the portfolio into those that are fine, some of that it's more severe and some there might be a large impact. Could you maybe frame how that process -- I mean the result of that process as a percent of your fair value or even more broadly kind of talk through the relative sizes of those buckets?\nCurtis Buser: Patrick, it's Curt. So here's how we thought about it. And look, it differs by each portfolio and segment. And the first thing that I'll say is a general comment is that from a valuation perspective, our process is systematic, consistent, lots of third-party reviews, we take it incredibly serious. And guess what, this was a hard quarter. A couple of specifics in terms of this quarter. First, very much of a forward-looking. So what is the -- our confidence around forward projections of earnings or cash flows and to the extent that, that was less certain, we took discount rates up. We also were very focused on near-term liquidity and to the extent that there were any near-term liquidity challenges, we obviously factored that into our thinking. . With respect to bucketing, most of that was really in our corporate private equity portfolio. And as we did that, roughly 27% of the corporate private equity portfolio was categorized as low impact. Meaning, generally, those investments experienced low single-digit movement, whether up or down, some of it was up, some of it was down, but kind of think about it as low single-digit movement either way. About 40% of the portfolio was categorized as medium impact. And those investments generally were modest negative appreciation or modest depreciation in the quarter. But about 30% of the portfolio was categorized as high impact and that drove most of the quarter's depreciation with some of that being 25% or so down. And that also kind of helped gear us in terms of where we're focused in terms of providing help and support across the portfolio. And in the other areas, I mean it was really the portfolio construction that really helped us, as Kew already mentioned, and I'll stop there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nDean Stephan: This is Dean Stephan on for Mike Carrier. Just a question around the realization outlook. I understand that at this point, the outlook is quite blurry. But can you help us understand maybe a V-shaped recovery versus U-shaped recovery areas that can potentially bounce back quicker? And then what type of recovery are you guys kind of forecasting at this point in time?\nKewsong Lee: Dean, it's Kew. I'll take that one. I mean, I think it's fair to say nobody really knows. It's going to take longer than not, and this is my personal opinion. It's probably not a V-shaped, but we're still early on. And obviously, there's a lot of dialogue going on exactly what the nature and path of the recovery is going to be. And so you're asking the right question, and I'm not trying to hide behind saying we don't know. But I think it's fair to say, we got to work this all through. We feel really good about our visibility across the world in all different regions and all different sectors. We had really teed up a lot of companies to hit the IPO market and/or to be sold. And we're feeling really good about the momentum we had, and that pipeline still exists. These companies are still chugging along, and it's a matter of when and how the markets open that we'll be able to access some of that with respect to realization activity. But as Curt pointed out -- it just wouldn't be right of us to try to forecast realization activity at this point in time because we still need to see how this is going to play out before we can give you more color on that.\nOperator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: So on the wide kind of FRE guide, if I take another tack at it, I think you said the core in 1Q is $92 million. And the midpoint of the new range is $425 million. So can you kind of bridge to maybe where you see the growth coming from 1Q? Because I think all I have of size in my numbers is the Alpinvest raise this year?\nCurtis Buser: Patrick, it's Curt. Let me give you some help. First, the starting point for this quarter, I think the core is $99 million. So there's $30 million of recovery. So $99 million is the place to start. The second thing I'd say is we raised $7.5 billion in the quarter. Our pending fee-earning AUM went up to $12.5 billion. So there's a lot of capital that we haven't activated fees on yet that we did like to spend all the money to kind of get raised. And that's going to come through here in the balance of the year. The other 2 things I'd point out are transaction fees were light in the quarter, will probably be light for the balance of the year because it will be tied to exits and activity and the like. But one never knows, and that's clearly in the way I had planned out the year, I was expecting more out of that and expecting more here in the first quarter and hopeful for some recovery. And then the third thing that hit us here in the quarter was $4 million on the CLOs. And so that -- I think if you put those things together, that's kind of the difference. And again, that fee-earning AUM is going to help glide us forward. If you think about -- I'm still optimistic in terms of our opportunities, both in the solutions business as well in the credit business. And both of those can help continue to drive growth, hard to predict, hard to call it out, hence the wide range, that's where I'm still optimistic about what we can do in the balance of the year.\nOperator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was just hoping to get a little bit more clarity and color around the credit business build-out and how the current environment has slowed or impacted that build out? And if you can give us maybe a sense of maybe what's on your to-do list next for the build-out and how that is evolving?\nKewsong Lee: Sure, Mike, it's Kew. I'll take that. With respect to the credit business, clearly, the more -- the most attractive from a fundraising, but also from a deployment perspective right now is in the more opportunistic, distressed, special situation, rescue capital type of strategies. It's more tactical strategies. We've received reverse inquiry already and have, in fact, launched to raise more money in the opportunistic strategies as well as distressed. And given that they're in market, I don't really want to comment on it, but suffice it to say, I do believe we're well positioned there in terms of not only on how we're positioned, but also the appetite from LPs.  With respect to the CLO business, I think it's fair to say, there's no real issuance of CLOs at the moment. And if the market is at about -- really at a standstill. But many of these structures are repositioning into higher-yielding loans, and you're going to start to see really interesting much more yield being obtained in these structures that we have. And I think it's important to point out Carlyle has no warehouses outstanding or hung warehouses at the moment. So we're very fortunately positioned in our CLO business.  The direct lending business is a business that I do think has opportunity. And I think it's fair to say that's the one strategy where I wish we had more dry powder. So we are thinking through at the moment how we intend to go obtain the dry powder for that strategy because let's face it. It's -- as with all the turmoil and the stresses in the markets, the ability to have private credit play a role to provide really important financing for companies, especially in that small to mid-market as traditional sources like the banks have really dried up, it's going to be a really important role as our economy restarts. And I do think that's a strategy that we are putting our heads together to figure out how we're going to go and get more dry powder for that team. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color. There are more opportunities than not on our credit platform, and we've already moved to start trying to figure out how to raise capital against some of those strategies, particularly on the opportunistic side of the equation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Jacoby: This is Daniel Jacoby filling in for Alex. Just kind of a bigger question on the FRE outlook, which is to say that last quarter's earnings call, you guys had spoken to kind of that next fundraising super cycle, commencing at the beginning of -- or at the end of 2021, kind of beginning 2022. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty and totally appreciate that, but just if you had to kind of put a guess together based on the information that we have at this point in time, any kind of color as to when that next fundraising super cycle is going to play out? Is it fair to think that, that's been pushed out somewhat? Or are we looking at kind of that's commencing as anticipated?\nGlenn Youngkin: Great. Daniel, this is Glenn, and thanks for the good question. So as we've said a number of times today, we're sharing with you everything that we know, but we're also quite aware of the many, many, many things we don't know. And I think that question is going to depend materially on the length of this recovery. Our funds, as we've talked about today, I think, have performed well. They performed relatively well, and they're well positioned from a construction standpoint and portfolio support standpoint. And so we think our investment performance will be attractive over the long term, which will set us up well for the next multiyear fundraising campaign. But at this point, it's really hard to tell whether that's going to land in the same spot or it may be delayed a bit, and that's going to fully be dependent on what happens here in the second half of this year from a recovery standpoint. So again, we really we don't want to skirt the question. We're thinking about it all the time, but the reality is, until we get a little bit more water under the bridge from this recovery pace, we're really not going to be able to give you a much more guidance than we think we'll do well in the next multiyear fundraising campaign. We think our funds will be attractive to our investors, but when that exactly starts, it's kind of hard to tell right now.\nDaniel Jacoby: Got it. And can I sneak in one more? Is that possible?\nCurtis Buser: Go ahead, Dan.\nDaniel Jacoby: Just kind of on the -- just on the FRE outlook. So kind of thinking about that $400 million to $450 million guidance, if I just compare that to the prior guidance of, I think, it was $475 million for 2020. I'm just trying to kind of bridge from the prior guidance to the current guidance. And I appreciate the color that you guys have provided on the CLO dynamics. If you were to kind of help me break this up in terms of -- and really just on a directional basis, between kind of the CLO dynamics versus the near-term slowdown in new commitments versus the lower transaction fees, kind of what does that breakdown look like as I try to bridge from prior to current guidance?\nCurtis Buser: So look, I fully appreciate the question. And it now sounds like you're doing what I do on a daily basis, which is trying to get the exact precision on a variety of variables and that's why we gave a wide range. If I could give you that -- if I could kind of narrow those things much more specifically in this environment, I would have given a tighter range and maybe not even move kind of the guidance. But there's just too much in terms of some of those pieces, in terms of how they'll play out. But again, I'd just point you back to the strength of our management fees, the pending fee-earning AUM and the overall position of where we are, think that we can count and our focus is very much on growing FRE for the long-term and improving our margins.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Daniel Harris\nDaniel Harris: Thank you all very much for your time, attention and focus today. We do look forward to speaking with you after the call. Any follow-ups, please contact Investor Relations. Stay safe and healthy, and we'll talk to you again soon.\nGlenn Youngkin: Thanks, everybody.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. And let me echo our sentiment of gratitude towards our health care professionals and frontline workers serving our communities around the world. I'm going to discuss our views on the impact of the current situation on our business, and after some financial commentary from Curt, we'll wrap up with thoughts on the future.  As Glenn noted, Carlyle was well positioned before the crisis. Our momentum has slowed but not stalled. We believe there could be a continuing and significant impact from this pandemic. The severity and duration of various health and economic issues and the shape and nature of the recovery are still unknowns, and therefore, all of this will take longer to play out than not. Our experience managing through disruptions and cycles in the past inform us of our path now. We are taking a cautionary stance in maintaining a balanced and patient perspective. By doing so, we are confident that over time, our shareholders as well as public pensions, endowments and foundations will benefit as we use our well-positioned global platform to drive value from our existing $143 billion of assets in the ground and put our $74 billion of dry powder to work towards attractive opportunities as they emerge around the world across various sectors in all asset classes.  We'd like to share our thoughts on how our business and the industry could be affected by this crisis in an effort to be as transparent and helpful as possible. So let me address 3 important dimensions: deal activity, valuations and fundraising.  First, the volume of traditional private equity investment is likely to decline significantly in the short term. Investors will step back and assess the real economic impact of the pandemic on businesses, their prospects and valuations. In our experience, financial buyers mark-to-market faster than sellers, and thus, there is likely to be reduced traditional deal activity for several quarters or more until some of this uncertainty abates. The majority of our $74 billion of dry powder was recently raised, we can afford to be patient and disciplined, and we look forward to many attractive opportunities, but it will take some time.  Similarly, traditional exit activity will be put on hold as IPOs are delayed and sales processes are put on pause until M&A activity and more confidence returns. Keep in mind, our fund structures do not have liquidity risk, and at Carlyle, we are never forced sellers and have the ability to hold assets through periods of market volatility and continue to build value in our companies and portfolio. We believe investment activity will recover at different rates and vary by asset classes, regions and sectors as the path of recovery becomes clearer. One bright spot is that credit deployment has already seen a significant increase as several of our funds are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on current market dislocations, particularly in credit opportunities, distressed and special situations. In addition, we are starting to see interesting new opportunities in Asia and in our secondaries business. And certain global sectors benefiting from structural changes, like technology and health care may present opportunities earlier than more cyclical sectors.  Certain industry sectors may experience more than just a short-term impact. Notably, the energy sector is undergoing a significant structural dislocation on both the supply and demand side that is likely to take more than a few quarters to play out. However, over the long term, we have more than $4 billion in dry powder to invest into new opportunities across our energy-related funds and what could be attractive valuations.  Let me now turn to the second important factor and speak to valuation challenges that could last beyond the quarter. As the full impact of global shutdowns and an uncertain recovery becomes more evident, there could be additional pressure on fund valuations. Our interim marks are important, the more significant driver of realized earnings in the future is the improvement in growth and performance of our portfolio companies over the long term, which is why one of our major priorities as an investment organization is to focus on our invested assets and drive value creation at our portfolio companies. We thought it would be helpful to share with you the diversification and how some of our most important portfolios are constructed in aggregate.  With respect to the remaining fair value of our entire corporate private equity portfolio, we have very little direct consumer retail exposure at about 5%. Relatively low exposure to commercial aviation at approximately 7%. We have very little energy exposure at 2% and less than 1% exposure to lodging and hotels. Finally, only 7% of the remaining fair value of our corporate private equity portfolio is in publicly listed securities.  Similarly, in our United States Real Estate portfolio, which represents far and away our largest holdings of real estate assets, we had only 2% of our U.S. Real Estate fair value invested in hotels, 2% in traditional office and only 1% in retail. Our energy exposure is largely concentrated in separate funds, which account for approximately $13 billion of fair value or roughly 9% of total firm-wide fair value. The segregation of these energy focused funds, which is a conscious design of our investment platform, is important because the performance and carry potential of our corporate private equity and other carry funds is independent of the results from these energy funds. Without a doubt, we will have some issues and troubles in each of our funds that will be problematic and need to be worked through. But our diversification and the way we have constructed our portfolios gives us confidence that over the long term, we are well positioned to continue driving performance and significant value creation. And having done so in the past, we believe our limited partners have come to appreciate our ability to deliver relative outperformance compared to public market indices.  Finally, let me address fundraising which, in aggregate, is likely to slow down in the short term as investors try to understand the current environment and their own specific needs. LPs are assessing the impact of this crisis on their portfolios and evaluating the denominator impact, allocation targets and liquidity schedules in light of market volatility. Our experience is that their pace of new commitments will slow down temporarily while they continue to fund their existing commitments. Having said this for the industry as a whole, some LPs will be more aggressive about continuing to lean into alternatives, and there will be opportunities to raise capital for tactical strategies in the near term to take advantage of dislocations, particularly in the credit asset class.  In the short term, we are in good shape as we have just completed a multiyear $110 billion fundraising campaign. And over the medium- to longer-term and what we have great confidence in, is that fund investors will ascribe increased value to relationships with their most trusted, well-resourced and experienced partners. We believe this positions Carlyle well for the potential to gain more wallet share from our limited partners as the fundraising environment stabilizes in the future.  Given these comments with regards to deal activity, valuations and fundraising, it's understandable there is more uncertainty with respect to near-term financial results, and we feel it is therefore prudent to remove prior guidance and for the moment, refrain from providing comprehensive guidance for the future. We have a strong handle on our business and the factors affecting us but believe it is appropriate to take our time to better understand the nature and path of recovery in the real economy and markets. To be clear, removal of our guidance should not be interpreted as anything other than our continued desire to build long-term credibility with our shareholders.  Before I hand the call off to Curt, let me conclude with this. The private capital industry has experienced attractive growth over the past several decades. This trend is likely to continue as private markets will remain an important source of capital and play an important role as the economy recovers. With every investment we make, we drive value creation and serve the pensions, endowments and foundations that will need our performance now more than ever.  Let me turn the call over to Curt to go through our financial results, and then I'll come back with some final thoughts. Over to you, Curt. Thank you, Curt. Let me end with a few thoughts on the future. The crisis has slowed, but by no means stalled the momentum we've established coming into this year. Our focus has not wavered, and we are uninterrupted in our work of driving value in our companies. Our 2020 financial results will reflect our solid start to the year and the relative stability of our fee earnings as we now adapt to emerging opportunities and trends and take advantage of our strong position to deliver on 2021 and beyond. To that end, our investment strategy remains on track. We are a global investment firm with a long-term orientation, seeking to generate attractive and consistent performance for our investors, who are relying on us now more than ever.  We are focused on generating as much value as possible from our existing and highly diversified portfolio for our fund investors and our shareholders. We are also patiently investing our dry powder and believe many attractive investment opportunities will emerge in the years to come. Our business strategy remains on track. We are growing our best-positioned and most scalable investment funds, managing our expenses prudently and finding the right opportunities to selectively expand and diversify our business. Our financial objectives are unchanged. We are focused on driving FRE each year, generating significant distributable earnings over the medium to long term, which, in combination with FRE, provides for a long-term attractive earnings growth profile, continuing to control equity dilution over time and protecting and increasing our dividend over time on a lagging basis to our FRE as it grows. No one could have predicted this pandemic but we had already been preparing our organization and investing with the mindset that we were late cycle in the economy.  Over the last three decades, we have become an industry leader, given our ability to build better businesses in partnership with great management teams through all sorts of economic and market cycles. We have confidence that our platform positions us well to navigate through and adapt to a new environment as we continue to find attractive investment opportunities and fund our strategies by raising significant amounts of new capital. We thank you for your support and partnership and hope that all of you stay safe and healthy.  With that, let turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. Craig, it's Kew. Let me just give you a little bit more color, and Curt did a good job of laying out the numbers and making a big distinction as to the performance of carry versus the other strategies we have in the portfolio. And remember, credit is a platform-based strategy. With respect to the marks that you saw, most of it, a large portion was driven in our Energy Mezzanine strategy, which several quarters ago, we've already announced, it's not a continuing strategy of Carlyle. The other main driver of the marks within our distressed business, which had a little bit of energy exposure. In the one fund that we can talk about is performance, which is a mature and fully invested fund. I can tell you the gross IRRs of that fund even after these marks is in excess of 20%. And the newer fund about half its capital is still available to invest. And I think it's fair to say distressed is one area where there's lots of great opportunities right now. And so having that dry powder is terrific. So if you look at that with some color, a lot of the marks are driven by what I would call strategies that we're not really going to be fundraising to into the future. And the other major driver was in the business, which actually has more opportunities now than ever before. Ken, it's Kew. I'll take on both of those. It's actually a great question. And the short answer, I think, the headline answer to your question on write-downs, no. But I think it's important to go through each one of them. And so if you don't mind, I will peel into each and give you a little bit of color. . Let's start with Fortitude first. It's well capitalized. We have an excess capital ratio of 210%, which is far above the 150% target ECR ratio. Our adjusted book value is up significantly from when we did this deal 1.5 years, 2 years ago. And the ROEs of the underlying business are strong and, let's call it, in the low to mid-teens. The biggest issue in the industry, and quite frankly, for Fortitude, is the impact on -- from all the volatility and the rate movements we've all experienced over the past several months. And I think it's really important to note Fortitude did a tremendous job of putting into place hedges and risk management maneuvers, which really insulated the capital in this business. In particular, when we first announced this transaction, we entered into hedges on interest rates, hedges to help us with our asset liability duration mismatch and hedges, which protect against spread volatility.  And when you throw all of that together, we have a company which has weathered the volatility that you've seen remarkably well, and we find the company in a position of strength and capital preservation, which is really fortuitous and really an advantageous position for that platform to be in this current environment. The reserves are performing as expected. It does not have any material COVID-19 risk, particularly from business interruption. The carve-out is proceeding on plan. We expect it to really be fully separated from AIG sometime this year. And 2 last points, we do expect the closing of an important element of this transaction, which is capital that we raised from our limited partners and some strategic partners to effectuate ownership of up to 97%, close to 100% of this business from AIG. That transaction is expected to close, I'd say, sometime by mid-year.  With respect to the investment management aspect of Fortitude, the rotation that we talked about in previous calls of rotating assets over into Carlyle from an investment management perspective remains on track, and we're quite pleased with the strategic partnership that we have with Fortitude. So I think in Fortitude's case, we're in pretty good shape as we sit here today.  Let me talk to aviation, which is the second aspect of your question, and I apologize for the length of the answer, but it's an important question that you asked. Look, this business is performing really well. In 2019, it generated approximately $40 million of revenue and over $10 million of FRE to Carlyle. And the acquisition has met or exceeded our expectations. There is fundraising going on for aviation. So I want to be careful what I say, but let me just state, it's off to a great start, and these are closed-end carry funds with locked-up capital.  Now of course, there's tremendous disruption that's occurred in the sector. Travel, flights being curtailed, airlines taking plans off of -- out of capacity, canceling orders, et cetera. This new fund that we've raised or in the process of finishing raising is a source of critically important financing to this market, and we believe it's really well positioned, and the timing is quite good. We have about $1 billion of dry powder to help finance important businesses to this vital sector for our economy. So we're hard at work managing this portfolio. The team is doing -- going beyond the call of duty, working with our airline partners, helping them keep aircraft on lease. As we sit here today, we feel very good about our aviation business and the future prospects in that company for us. Yes, Glenn, that was really good. Two or 3 additional points, Glenn. First, obviously, we've been in very close contact with all of our LPs, as Glenn just mentioned. And we have, in fact, issued some significant capital calls and all of them have been met with no problems. So just you know, we have been functioning. We have been issuing capital calls, and those calls are being met.  Second, look, every crisis is different, and who knows how this will play out versus the GFC. For whatever it's worth, if you go back to the great financial crisis, similar question were asked of us. And we can tell you in hindsight, there were all capital calls were, in essence, met and no material, if any significant defaults occurred with respect to our funding base with respect to LP commitments.  And then finally, with respect to your question on dedicated funds. Look, this is an interesting question. And different LPs are set up differently, and some have different ways of allocating and prefer focused strategies for their portfolios. But also for us, it's a conscious way that we've designed our investment platform, recognizing that certain strategies are distinct and have their own inherent characteristics. But the importance that having energy and dedicated funds brings out in periods like this, is that the volatility of those funds does not help nor impair the ability of our other funds to drive value and get to carry. Because remember, the way funds work with their press and their hurdle is its cumulative and aggregated rates of return across all deals in that fund. So to the extent you have overexposure to certain sectors or deals that take the fund, the performance overall down, that fund would be in jeopardy of not getting to carry.  So it's a very important point, Glenn, that you just touched on. And so by having inherently more volatile strategies in more focused funds, we think it does two things. One, it helps our LPs from an allocation perspective because many LPs do want those types of strategies broken out. But second, from our investment performance, but more importantly, our ability to deliver distributable earnings in the future. It does have the effect of insulating our more traditional strategies from the downside and upside from these more volatile strategies. So hopefully, Glenn, that gives you a little bit more color. That was pretty good, Curt. Dean, it's Kew. I'll take that one. I mean, I think it's fair to say nobody really knows. It's going to take longer than not, and this is my personal opinion. It's probably not a V-shaped, but we're still early on. And obviously, there's a lot of dialogue going on exactly what the nature and path of the recovery is going to be. And so you're asking the right question, and I'm not trying to hide behind saying we don't know. But I think it's fair to say, we got to work this all through. We feel really good about our visibility across the world in all different regions and all different sectors. We had really teed up a lot of companies to hit the IPO market and/or to be sold. And we're feeling really good about the momentum we had, and that pipeline still exists. These companies are still chugging along, and it's a matter of when and how the markets open that we'll be able to access some of that with respect to realization activity. But as Curt pointed out -- it just wouldn't be right of us to try to forecast realization activity at this point in time because we still need to see how this is going to play out before we can give you more color on that. Sure, Mike, it's Kew. I'll take that. With respect to the credit business, clearly, the more -- the most attractive from a fundraising, but also from a deployment perspective right now is in the more opportunistic, distressed, special situation, rescue capital type of strategies. It's more tactical strategies. We've received reverse inquiry already and have, in fact, launched to raise more money in the opportunistic strategies as well as distressed. And given that they're in market, I don't really want to comment on it, but suffice it to say, I do believe we're well positioned there in terms of not only on how we're positioned, but also the appetite from LPs.  With respect to the CLO business, I think it's fair to say, there's no real issuance of CLOs at the moment. And if the market is at about -- really at a standstill. But many of these structures are repositioning into higher-yielding loans, and you're going to start to see really interesting much more yield being obtained in these structures that we have. And I think it's important to point out Carlyle has no warehouses outstanding or hung warehouses at the moment. So we're very fortunately positioned in our CLO business.  The direct lending business is a business that I do think has opportunity. And I think it's fair to say that's the one strategy where I wish we had more dry powder. So we are thinking through at the moment how we intend to go obtain the dry powder for that strategy because let's face it. It's -- as with all the turmoil and the stresses in the markets, the ability to have private credit play a role to provide really important financing for companies, especially in that small to mid-market as traditional sources like the banks have really dried up, it's going to be a really important role as our economy restarts. And I do think that's a strategy that we are putting our heads together to figure out how we're going to go and get more dry powder for that team. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color. There are more opportunities than not on our credit platform, and we've already moved to start trying to figure out how to raise capital against some of those strategies, particularly on the opportunistic side of the equation. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Youngkin",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. To describe the current global health and economic crisis as unprecedented feels wholly inadequate. The human toll is tragic, and the economic damage has been extensive. I want to start by thanking all of the health care professionals and frontline workers helping to protect and heal our communities. Our thoughts and prayers are foremost with the people and families across the globe that have been and continue to be impacted by this pandemic. As the situation has continued to unfold, our top priorities at Carlyle have been and remain the health and safety of our people and their families as well as supporting our portfolio in every way we can and ensuring that we can continue to deliver for investors and all stakeholders by mobilizing our extensive global platform and every resource at our disposal.  Carlyle was in a position of strength leading into this crisis, which has provided us great stability. The pandemic has shocked the world over the past 4 months, but we've been able to mobilize quickly and decisively. Thanks to the great work and continuity across our entire global platform. Kew and I are incredibly proud of the Carlyle team. We have found an even greater level of both collaboration and commitment and compassion and service.  The first quarter of 2020 started off exceptionally well with our 2019 momentum continuing. At the firm level, our outlook for the year was developing as envisioned, with solid earnings growth, substantial dry powder from our $110 billion fundraising campaign, our successful transition to a C-corp and a sturdy balance sheet. In addition, our portfolios were in good shape and performing well with strong investment and exit pipelines. In the first quarter, we were able to execute several IPOs, secondary trades and announced transactions. Including the IPO of One Medical and the sale of Sundyne from our US Buyout portfolio, block trades in China Literature and MicroPort in our Asia buyout portfolios and numerous sales from our U.S. Real Estate funds. Fundraising momentum continued into the early part of the year, with $7.5 billion of new capital raised in the first quarter. So while the pandemic has shocked the world, Carlyle was sturdy and steady going into the storm.  Upon the onset of the crisis in January, our China team took decisive action, which set the precedent for our other regions and accelerated our decision-making process in Europe and the United States. In March, we quickly moved all of our U.S. and Europe employees to work remotely. We then activated our business continuity plans and to date have seen near-perfect execution. Early on, Carlyle's investment teams were active, stress testing every equity and credit position in our portfolio and making decisions for each asset based on varying levels of business disruption. And One Carlyle, our global resource platform, has been an action like never before, using all of our capabilities to provide support for our portfolio companies. We've also been leveraging many of the company's unique offerings, particularly in health care and technology to help provide solutions to the most pressing issues as many of our companies have also been upfront in the fight against the virus. For example, PA Consulting has done great work coordinating efforts to source ventilators for patients in the U.K., and most recently, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics announced breakthrough work to rapidly deploy antibody tests.  With that said, it is clear that the next few months and quarters will be challenging. It is our view that the recovery will progress in fits and starts and will take longer than what we all would have hoped. With this in mind, we remain fully committed to our top priorities, but also to our strategy as long-term investors and partners to our portfolio companies and our LPs. We're planning for and preparing for a wide range of outcomes, and we do remain in a strong position with $74 billion of dry powder, $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and $525 million in capacity on our revolver, a global team and platform that are stronger than ever and deep experience across Carlyle as we have previously operated successfully through economic, financial and market crisis.  There's no doubt that we have much work to do, and I'll hand it over to Kew to walk you through some of our thoughts for the future. I, again, want to reiterate that our leadership team is active and focused on driving value for our fund investors and shareholders. And we thank you for your commitment to us, and we assure you that the Carlyle team remains equally committed to all of you.  With that, let me turn the call over to Kew. Great. Jerry, thanks for the question. So first of all, the primary step of transitioning was to get everybody working remotely and stood up. And so over the course of the January, February and March period, we had 100% of our workforce move to remote working. And that's over more than 30 offices on 6 continents, and that was a big step, and it worked extraordinarily well. I think in the first week of activity, we had 40,000 video conference calls.  The second big step was to move through the portfolio aggressively and really triage. And we categorize the businesses into and real estate assets and energy companies and loan positions into 1 of 3 buckets. A bucket that it was going to be -- going to have a limited impact from all of this. A bucket that it was going to have a much more severe impact and a bucket that it was going to have potentially a large impact. And I do think that, that first amount of work allowed us to really focus on liquidity and where we needed to spend our time.  And then the second -- the final big area of activity was how can we use the global resources at Carlyle in order to really support these companies. And just a couple of examples. Early on, we convened a global meeting with all of the chief information officers of the big companies, and helped them figure out how do we, in fact, help you transition into a remote working environment. We also did an enormous amount of work in helping kind of clean up some supply chains that were interrupted. We had a number of companies that literally couldn't source key components to their manufacturing process. And so the global Carlyle resource team went to work to help people source components. And then, of course, we were supporting a number of these companies that were bringing some really innovative ways to support frontline virus initiatives. One Medical, all of a sudden was able to provide remote COVID-19 diagnostics for people, and it wasn't in place beforehand. So it was across the whole portfolio, but the very first steps, we're getting people stood up, then the heavy work on the portfolio and then using the big broad Carlyle platform in order to support each and every one of the companies. Okay. Glenn, thanks for that question. Let me get started, but I have a feeling, Kew will be able to jump in and provide some thoughts as well. So first, the LP universe, the fund investor universe has broadly gone into this pandemic in much better shape than they went into the great financial crisis. And the primary reason is the great financial crisis educated a lot of investors on how to manage liquidity, especially and particularly how important their private capital portfolios are. And in fact, coming out of the great financial crisis, it was the private capital portfolios that performed extraordinarily well that enabled many of these investors to get back ahead of some losses that they had had in other parts of their portfolio. . What we hear from our investors is, of course, different across the whole set. But in general, as Kew mentioned in his comments, they're catching their breath a bit, and they're making sure they understand what they have in their portfolio, but some of them really are leaning in. And so we do see investment processes continuing, commitments continuing. As Kew said, I think the front end of that is in credit. We also see it in secondaries. I would call those sectors that are really able to take advantage of the dislocation. The next area of interest from investors is what's going to come during the rebound. And I think we're starting to see some real interest in investing into that phase. But as Kew said, we do think that traditional private equity-type investing will be at the back end of this recovery. And investors recognize that.  My final comment, and then I'll invite Kew in for something -- for a comment. My final comment is the most important aspect of this has been the intimacy that we share with our investors. And one of the things that, in fact, happened during this period is we were very quick to inform them where the portfolios are, very quick to interact with them on the status of the various portfolio companies. And I think that's the long-term relationship that really does underpin their confidence in having us as one of their core, core, core private capital partners. Kew, anything else you'd add? No, No, Curt, you did a really good job there. Great. Daniel, this is Glenn, and thanks for the good question. So as we've said a number of times today, we're sharing with you everything that we know, but we're also quite aware of the many, many, many things we don't know. And I think that question is going to depend materially on the length of this recovery. Our funds, as we've talked about today, I think, have performed well. They performed relatively well, and they're well positioned from a construction standpoint and portfolio support standpoint. And so we think our investment performance will be attractive over the long term, which will set us up well for the next multiyear fundraising campaign. But at this point, it's really hard to tell whether that's going to land in the same spot or it may be delayed a bit, and that's going to fully be dependent on what happens here in the second half of this year from a recovery standpoint. So again, we really we don't want to skirt the question. We're thinking about it all the time, but the reality is, until we get a little bit more water under the bridge from this recovery pace, we're really not going to be able to give you a much more guidance than we think we'll do well in the next multiyear fundraising campaign. We think our funds will be attractive to our investors, but when that exactly starts, it's kind of hard to tell right now. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Curtis Buser",
            "content": "Thanks, Kew. In my remarks, I will briefly discuss first quarter 2020 results and then frame some of the important issues we're watching. Let's begin with our results for the quarter. Fee-related earnings were $129 million with a 33% margin, up from $103 million in the first quarter of 2019. We recovered $30 million of litigation costs in connection with the final settlement of the Carlyle Capital Corp. Litigation, which is included as a reduction of G&A expense. Excluding this recovery, FRE would have been $99 million with a 25% margin, which reflects some specific revenue shortfalls that developed in March due to the pandemic related to CLOs and transaction fees, both of which, I will comment on further in a minute.  Net realized performance revenues began the year on plan with several carry-producing exits, which then slowed as the crisis emerged globally in March. Overall, pretax distributable earnings were $175 million in the first quarter compared to $101 million in the first quarter of 2019. With markets still unstable and exit slowing, the pace of realizations over the next few quarters is expected to slow, and quarterly realized performance revenues are likely to be below this quarter for the next several quarters.  Our valuations were lower in the quarter. Our corporate private equity funds depreciated 8% in the first quarter compared to the MSCI All Country World index decline of 23% over the same period. Real estate was generally stable, down 1% in the quarter, while our natural resources funds, which have a large energy component depreciated 22%. Investment Solutions appreciated 1% in the quarter, reflecting the standard 1 quarter lag in portfolio valuation for this segment.  As a result, in total, net accrued performance revenue on our balance sheet declined to $1.2 billion from $1.7 billion at year-end. It's important to note that our accrued clawback remained insignificant and unchanged from year-end. And while it's possible that our net accrued carry could further decrease should values continue to decline, we do not expect a material change in our accrued clawback.  As Kew said, given the very high level of uncertainty for the rest of 2020, we are not able to provide comprehensive forward guidance at this time. But let me frame certain aspects of our fee revenues and expenses. Starting with fee revenues. One key point is that approximately 98% of our management fees arise from fee-earning AUM located in closed-end fund structures with no redemption risk. Furthermore, approximately 90% of our fee revenues are from traditional closed-end, long-dated funds for which our fees are highly predictable and stable and have very little exposure to fund valuations. While we have $12.5 billion of pending fee-earning AUM that is not yet activated fees, further management fee growth relies on new vintages or new carry fund families. To the extent fundraising is delayed, growth of this revenue base will be similarly delayed.  With regards to the other 10% of fee revenue, we earned about $120 million annually from management fees on our CLOs in the form of base fees and subordinated fees. Subordinated fees represent about 70% of this revenue base. Credit rating downgrades across the industry may cause the subordinated fees to be deferred. These deferred fees can be subsequently turned back on and recaptured based on the actual default rates and cash returns within the CLO structures.  During this quarter, we did not recognize $4 million of subordinated fees, which were deferred. If the rating agencies further downgrade bonds and loans in which the CLOs have invested, it's likely that CLOs across the industry will experience revenue deferrals over the course of this year. During the great financial crisis, we saw the majority of CLOs across the industry shut off subordinated fees, but 100% of our CLO subordinated fees were turned back on, and all of our deferred revenue was recovered.  Finally, transaction and advisory fees generated $53 million of fee revenue in 2019 and are likely to trend lower with a slower pace of closed investments. Shifting now from revenues to expenses. Cash compensation was $204 million in Q1 2020, generally in line with the first quarter of 2019. In a given year, a little over half of total cash compensation and benefits expense is due to variable year-end compensation. We will actively manage this level based on actual results for the year. We have control over our professional fees, travel and entertainment and general and administrative expenses, which in some cases, like travel, will be lower; and in other cases, where we'll even more tightly manage expenditures.  When you put all of this together, it's really hard to say where exactly our 2020 distributable earnings will land. Forecasting FRE is more doable. But given the current economic uncertainties, we are currently estimating a wide range of $400 million to $450 million for our 2020 FRE outlook.  Two last items. First, we continue to manage equity-based compensation expense and the $32 million in equity-based compensation expense compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2019, represented a 19% decline. Second, as Glenn noted, we are in a strong liquidity position and accordingly declared a dividend of $0.25 per share in line with our planned fixed dividend of $1 annually.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Kew. Thanks, Bill, for your question, and good to talk to you this morning. So first, I just want to reiterate, we remain really focused on growing fee-related earnings and also improving our FRE margin over time. We have a great handle on our business. But even with having a great handle on our business, there's still much that we don't know about how the pandemic will play out and how it will impact us. So for example, I don't know what further downgrades to expect from the rating agencies and how that could potentially affect our CLO subordinated fees, as I described in my opening remarks. I'm hopeful that it has really no material effect. And you can kind of see it was only $4 million here in the first quarter. But if you look back to the great financial crisis, obviously, it had a bigger impact. . That said, there are a lot of great aspects of our business model that clearly help. 98% of our fee-earning AUM has no redemption risk. 90% of our fee revenues is from predictable and stable management fee streams. And our LP defaults have historically been nonexistent. So we remain committed to growing FRE. But right now, it's hard really to kind of exactly see how this plays out. And we have a lot of good levers. And right now, I think it's the right thing to kind of appropriately set this in the $400 million to $450 million. Bill, it is a wide range. I wish I could give you much more precision, but it's just too early in the year to give you that kind of precision. Craig, thanks for your answer. So as again, as we think about our global credit carry funds, the 21% is just the carry funds. And the carry funds are about 25%, and that number is inclusive of the aviation business. But it doesn't include the direct lending. It doesn't include the other aspects of the business, including the CLOs. The CLOs fundamentally really don't drive off of their marks, right? They drive off of the default rates within the underlying CLOs. And so really not as relevant. I need to be a little careful about disclosure around the BDC at this time because it is a separate public company and hasn't separately released its earnings. The key thing in that business is managing those portfolios over time. Key thing is managing default rates and how it all plays out over time, we remain really optimistic about it. Lots of great opportunities to come. And I think that you got to put that 21%, clearly, in perspective, it has a high energy concentration. That's from our energy mezz funds and so I wouldn't let that distort the whole thing, and that's why we only give you the carry funds because it's the only thing that's really comparable here. I don't know if Kew or Glenn, there's anything you'd like to add to that. Mike, it's Curt. I'll start, and then one of the other guys and also join in. So just to be clear, in the quarter, I would say that we had 4 significant funds fall out of carry: Our Europe Buyout fund, the fourth version of that; our international energy buyout fund, that's the first version of that; our long-dated fund and then credit opportunities fund. Now the point isn't always ever where is something marked today, it's obviously where it performs over time. And each of these have different strategies. They're very unique. But we are working hard on all of them to position them back into carry. And if you go back to the great financial crisis, we had the same thing happened. Our fourth US Buyout fund fell out of accrued carry. Well, guess what? I am really happy that I was invested in that fourth US Buyout fund because it did great.  Also, our fifth U.S. Real Estate fund sell-out of a crude carry during that time, and it came back and has done well. And it's in accrued carry to even at this point in time. So these funds -- look, the energy implication on international energy, I mean you understand that story. The long-dated funds got a long time for this to play out. It's actually still deploying capital. Our credit opportunities fund is incredibly well positioned. And it's also in a place where there's a little bit more capital to deploy, but also as the nature of that portfolio over time, we like it. And our Europe Buyout portfolio, it will have some challenges, but its diversity in terms of structure is good. So hopefully, that solves -- answers your question. I don't know if Glenn or Kew, anything you want to add. . Patrick, it's Curt. So here's how we thought about it. And look, it differs by each portfolio and segment. And the first thing that I'll say is a general comment is that from a valuation perspective, our process is systematic, consistent, lots of third-party reviews, we take it incredibly serious. And guess what, this was a hard quarter. A couple of specifics in terms of this quarter. First, very much of a forward-looking. So what is the -- our confidence around forward projections of earnings or cash flows and to the extent that, that was less certain, we took discount rates up. We also were very focused on near-term liquidity and to the extent that there were any near-term liquidity challenges, we obviously factored that into our thinking. . With respect to bucketing, most of that was really in our corporate private equity portfolio. And as we did that, roughly 27% of the corporate private equity portfolio was categorized as low impact. Meaning, generally, those investments experienced low single-digit movement, whether up or down, some of it was up, some of it was down, but kind of think about it as low single-digit movement either way. About 40% of the portfolio was categorized as medium impact. And those investments generally were modest negative appreciation or modest depreciation in the quarter. But about 30% of the portfolio was categorized as high impact and that drove most of the quarter's depreciation with some of that being 25% or so down. And that also kind of helped gear us in terms of where we're focused in terms of providing help and support across the portfolio. And in the other areas, I mean it was really the portfolio construction that really helped us, as Kew already mentioned, and I'll stop there. Patrick, it's Curt. Let me give you some help. First, the starting point for this quarter, I think the core is $99 million. So there's $30 million of recovery. So $99 million is the place to start. The second thing I'd say is we raised $7.5 billion in the quarter. Our pending fee-earning AUM went up to $12.5 billion. So there's a lot of capital that we haven't activated fees on yet that we did like to spend all the money to kind of get raised. And that's going to come through here in the balance of the year. The other 2 things I'd point out are transaction fees were light in the quarter, will probably be light for the balance of the year because it will be tied to exits and activity and the like. But one never knows, and that's clearly in the way I had planned out the year, I was expecting more out of that and expecting more here in the first quarter and hopeful for some recovery. And then the third thing that hit us here in the quarter was $4 million on the CLOs. And so that -- I think if you put those things together, that's kind of the difference. And again, that fee-earning AUM is going to help glide us forward. If you think about -- I'm still optimistic in terms of our opportunities, both in the solutions business as well in the credit business. And both of those can help continue to drive growth, hard to predict, hard to call it out, hence the wide range, that's where I'm still optimistic about what we can do in the balance of the year. Go ahead, Dan. So look, I fully appreciate the question. And it now sounds like you're doing what I do on a daily basis, which is trying to get the exact precision on a variety of variables and that's why we gave a wide range. If I could give you that -- if I could kind of narrow those things much more specifically in this environment, I would have given a tighter range and maybe not even move kind of the guidance. But there's just too much in terms of some of those pieces, in terms of how they'll play out. But again, I'd just point you back to the strength of our management fees, the pending fee-earning AUM and the overall position of where we are, think that we can count and our focus is very much on growing FRE for the long-term and improving our margins."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.carlyle.com. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings presentation to the extent reasonably available. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Turning to our results. For the fourth quarter, we generated $174 million in fee-related earnings and $903 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $2.01. We produced net realized performance revenue of $683 million and enter 2022 with an accrued carry balance of $3.9 billion. And for the full year, we generated $598 million in FRE and $2.2 billion in distributable earnings, with DE per share of $5.01. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. To ensure participation by all those on the call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then return to the queue for any additional questions. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Dan. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as provide line of sight into 2022. We started last year by laying out our strategic plan for future growth, and I\u2019m pleased to tell you that we are delivering on our goals. We had an exceptional 2021 with records across the board and fee-related earnings, distributable earnings and every major investment metric. I\u2019m proud of our people and the results they have collectively produced. Our fourth quarter performance caps this strong year and illustrates the powerful growth trajectory across a more diversified platform. I want to highlight the key drivers underpinning our record year. As our FRE has grown to new sustainable levels, our growth initiatives are starting to payoff, and our performance has set the stage for robust distributable earnings over the next several years. Let\u2019s start by underscoring our investment performance with valuations increasing 41% year-over-year and realizations of $44 billion across all of our traditional carry funds. Portfolio construction continues to be a strength, especially as we enter a period of greater volatility. We\u2019re investing more capital as we expand our aperture and leverage even more effectively our global scale and sector expertise. This has resulted in record investment activity. We deployed $14 billion in Q4 alone, and $34 billion in 2021, each a record. This investment performed ability to send realized proceeds back to our limited partners has helped their fundraising efforts. In 2021, we raised $51 billion nearly double what we\u2019ve raised in 2020. We aim to continue this momentum over the next few years as we focus on the substantial upside potential to our Investor Day target, which would help us drive financial results beyond our FRE ambitions. Alternative sources of capital formation such as high net worth, retail, open-ended funds, permanent capital and insurance represent upside and are an increasing source of fundraising dollars as we pick our spots to grow these sources of capital. Stepping back, the headline is, we ended 2021 with strong fundraising momentum that will carry over into 2022. Our extraordinary performance across the board has established a new level of earnings power, which gives us the confidence to raise our dividend substantially. You\u2019ll hear more on this from Curt later. More importantly, this performance also gives us the resources to continue investing strategically to build the firm and accelerate growth. Now turning to strategic growth opportunities, our investments in Global Credit are paying off, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. For example, our credit opportunity strategy has grown to $8 billion in about 4 years, and with Carlyle Aviation, we expect FRE to triple in 3 years since the acquisition. The growth continues with our energy now focused on building out infrastructure credit, which we are doing organically and jumpstarting growth in real estate credit. Another scalable platform initiative is Fortitude, which continues to progress as planned. And given the current activity level and pipeline, we are confident that 2022 could be a breakout year for this very scalable permanent capital platform. Several years ago, we asked for patience as we rebuilt our global credit platform. We\u2019re using the same playbook in other areas like infrastructure and renewables, where we see significant room for growth, and similar to Fortitude anticipate an active year. Finally, our focus on building the firm includes investment and leadership and impact and ESG capabilities, which are increasingly required to drive returns and meet the needs of our LPs. At Carlyle, ESG is not one fund or product, but a part of everything we do. One example is the ESG data convergence project announced in partnership with CalPERS in September 2021, which has reached a milestone commitment of over 100 leading GPs and LPs globally to its partnership, representing $8.7 trillion in AUM, and over 1,400 underlying portfolio companies. And just this week, Carlyle took another important step as one of the first in our industry to announce its commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner across direct investments. By integrating an ESG mindset across the firm in our investment processes and throughout our value creation, our approach benefits all stakeholders. To wrap up, we enter 2022 better position than ever before. Carlyle is a stronger and healthier firm today because of our 2021 progress. Our focus remains on continuously improving how we drive value in generating attractive returns. And we\u2019re confident in our ability to grow FRE, drive investment performance, and strategically build the firm for future growth. We are focused on building the best investment firm possible and running it better than ever before. As the environment continually shifts around us, our diversified investment platform and global team have demonstrated resilience and adaptability. I remain confident in our ability to thrive and capture opportunities in any environment. I\u2019m proud of our team, and we remain focused on continuing to deliver for shareholders and all stakeholders. I appreciate the hard work as we accelerate our activity for another very active year of executing on our vision of thinking bigger, moving faster and performing better. Over to you, Curt.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Kew, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by reiterating many things Kew mentioned to emphasize what our strong performance this year means. We generated over $5 per share in distributable earnings in 2021, well more than double the average generated in the last 5 years. In fact, the fourth quarters $2.01 per share would have exceeded the full year in 4 of the past 5 years. These results are driven by attractive investment performance, and are fortifying our balance sheet to help us deliver long-term sustainable growth in our global platform and fee-related earnings. Let\u2019s dive deeper into all of this. This year we focused on delivering strong, sustainable and growing fee-related earnings. 2021 was a record year for the firm\u2019s overall FRE, every segment generated record FRE, and our full-year FRE margin grew to 33%, up from 30% in 2020. In fact, FRE grew more than 20% off the adjusted level in 2020 and our 5-year FRE CAGR is 24%. This is the outcome of scaling our platform and positioning Carlyle for growth. As Kew noted, we also had a record year for fundraising, and much of that will have a stronger impact on fee-related earnings in 2022. Record fundraising of $51 billion along with strong fund performance to help drive total assets under management, up 22% over the past year. As we look ahead, we will continue to focus on running the firm effectively and efficiently. On an organic basis, we expect to see FRE growth of more than 20% in 2022 driven by strong top-line growth. 2021 fundraising underpins much of our expected growth in 2022. Notably, we activated fees on our new U.S. buyout and growth capital funds, as well as our most recent U.S. real estate fund, all in Q4, elevating fee revenues in the fourth quarter and setting the stage for higher fee revenues this year. In addition, we expect to see a breakout year for global credit in 2022. The business has $73 billion in assets under management as of year-end, more than 2 times larger than it was less than 4 years ago, underpinned by nearly $17 billion in fundraising in 2021 for a broad spectrum of strategies, as many investors continue to shift away from traditional fixed income to private credit opportunities. This segment has several scaled products, structured credit, opportunistic credit, direct lending and aviation as well as several newer products in infrastructure and real estate credit, including the recent iStar transaction that will close in the coming weeks that are all well positioned for growth. Our Global Investment Solutions business has the scale global reach and data to help fund investors continually reassess and reconstruct their portfolios in pursuit of capturing returns. In a world where private capitals become mainstream, and a significant portion of our investor portfolios, this approach is more important than ever before, and is able to this business to more than double FRE to $84 million from $37 million just a year-ago. Performance has also been impressive with appreciation of 48% in 2021, and net accrued performance revenues of $390 million at year end, more than double from a year-ago. Our Global Private Equity business is a diversified business with platform supporting corporate private equity, real estate, infrastructure and natural resources all on a global basis. In corporate private equity, we\u2019re a builder of businesses pulling more value creation levers than ever helping companies reinvent their business models and drive growth. You can see the results of this work in our record net realized performance revenues. Just in the fourth quarter Global Private Equity realized $10 billion in proceeds fueled by exits in PPD, PK, CoreSite, and the sale of more than $1 billion of ZoomInfo. As Kew said earlier, this success is a function of our investment in teams, technology, diversity and platforms. We have $124 billion in remaining fair value of invested assets in just our traditional carry funds, which ended the year up 30% year-over-year, and positioned us for continued to significant realizations in the future. 2021 was a special year with over $1.5 billion in net realized performance revenues, which will be difficult to replicate. But we believe 2022 will be another strong year, we should realize on average $1 billion over each of the next several years. Of course, in any given year, the health of the global markets is likely to drive variants the upside or downside around that expectation. Finally, I\u2019d like to spend some time on the strength of our balance sheet. After prepaying $250 million over 2023 bonds, our balance sheet reflects $2.5 billion in cash and $2.1 billion in firm investments. To put the cash balance in perspective, cash increased nearly $1.5 billion from a year-ago. In 2021, we generated realized investment income of $210 million from our balance sheet investments are nearly triple what we earned the previous year. Again, this level of income realizations may not be easy to replicate, but we believe that we should routinely generate investment income at levels of $150 million or more per year on average. Our strong cash position, an expectation for elevated earnings positioned us to deploy our capital as we previously discussed. This includes investing in next generation funds and new strategies, growing our adjacencies, pursuing accretive inorganic growth. We see various opportunities to drive shareholder value resulting from the improved strength of our balance sheet. Our credit ratings at both S&P and Fitch are on a positive watch for potential upgrade, highlighting the upward trajectory of our firm and our financial footing. The strength of our balance sheet along with a significant increase in FRE in 2021 allows the board to comfortably and sustainably raise our fixed dividend to $1.30 for 2022, a 30% increase. The higher dividend will begin with Q1. As we continue to grow FRE from here, and as we laid out in our strategic plan, we expect we will be able to raise the dividend further in coming years. We\u2019re outperforming our own expectations and believe we are well positioned to do so for the next several years. Our strong momentum is allowing us to grow our fee-related earnings and distribute earnings and invest in Carlyle\u2019s longer-term growth. We are creating exceptional value for shareholders and we will continue to deliver on this growth in 2022. Now, let me turn the call over to the operator, so we can take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So first question just a little bit more strategic, I guess, Kew, 2021 was a really strong year essential on every front, but most notably FRE growth. One of the concerns we continue to hear from investors and Carlyle broadly, is that you really won\u2019t be able to sustain that kind of growth momentum going forward. But from your comments, you seem to be obviously pretty confident in that. So where is the disconnect, how do you expect the dynamic to play out and maybe give us a little bit more in terms of the drivers that gives you that confidence?\nKewsong Lee: Yeah, good morning, Alex. Look, I\u2019m really confident. And importantly, the entire team is confident in our momentum, and the fact that we\u2019re going to keep this going. Look, the FRE has already been growing 20% a year for the past five years, I think, that\u2019s mostly gone unnoticed. And if you get a little bit more granular, if you look at Q4, we generated $174 million of FRE, that run rate multiply that by 4, it already positions us for a strong year of FRE growth in 2022. And that\u2019s before additional upside from our activities that we\u2019ve got underway. Look, with respect to business building, I think you touched on it in your note this morning, and it\u2019s the right place to look. Our Global Credit business is about to have a breakout year, we\u2019ve talked to you about the fundraising, it\u2019s got over $70 billion of AUM raised $17 billion last year, but really the thing to look at all the patients in building that business, this is the year where I think operating leverage really starts to kick in. And I think off of that growth, more is going to fall to the bottom line with respect to FRE. And then turning to our incredible investment performance. It\u2019s across the board and despite the record realizations we had, we still have about $4 billion of net accrued carry balances. It\u2019s very diversified across regions, across sectors across funds. For me \u2013 for us, it\u2019s not a question of, if this comes out, but when it comes out, as Curt alluded to in his comments. And then let me just address, the broader base momentum we have on fundraising. So we pointed out $51 billion of fundraising, I want to note, two-thirds of that was away from corporate private equity, healthy fundraising in U.S. real estate, in solutions, in credit, it\u2019s broad-based across all segments. And I point that out, because, I think folks on appreciating that we\u2019re much more diversified and it\u2019s a much broader business and a platform than ever before. Now, of course, this is all before the fact that our balance sheet is about as strong as it\u2019s ever been. And, I\u2019m very focused on driving the firm into new strategic adjacencies in markets that are large, that are scalable, and that can be very FRE generative. So when you throw that all together, yeah, I\u2019m really confident. And the last piece to all this, you need a great team, this team is executing. So all of that is what gives me confidence that this is going to continue.\nAlex Blostein: Great. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for that. My follow-up is going to touch around just the operating leverage in the model and I really want to zone in on compensation philosophy. We\u2019ve seen a number of players in the alternative space sort of shove the compensation structure toward paying out more carry and obviously maximizing FRE margins, including a recent list at a large private equity firm, as I\u2019m sure you guys know. Although, there\u2019s a degree of just P&L geography, obviously, and all of that it does align compensation with fund performance and therefore, LP. So what are your thoughts about that dynamic for Carlyle? And as you\u2019re a lot more scale today than in the past, just with respect to management fee base, why not pursue a similar strategy?\nCurtis Buser: Alex, thanks for that. This is Curt. Let me take that. So first, compensation structures, as you point out, are really important in driving behavior. And we feel good about our structures, and how they\u2019re aligned for stakeholders across all investment cycles. Of course, we\u2019re always thinking about compensation and alignment, and how to better align compensation of our professionals with that of our shareholders, and performance. Because what you pay for is likely we\u2019re going to be what you get. At the same time, we do believe in pay for performance, and have been consistent in saying that our split our performance compensation shows strong alignment with limited partners on carry and fund performance with shareholders on driving fee-related earnings, and using the firm capital to build our retained earnings. So that\u2019s important for driving future growth. We\u2019re going to continue to grow our business and earnings that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We\u2019ve been doing that really well as Kew just outlined have great confidence in the future. And to the extent that we decided to make any changes in our compensation models, we\u2019ll let you know. But the bottom line is we believe in alignment.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks for taking both questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Kew and Curt. Hope everyone\u2019s doing well.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Craig, nice to hear from you.\nCurtis Buser: Great. Nice to hear from you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So my first questions on credit and a similar question to Alex\u2019s first one. But $17 billion of fundraising in 2021, this was a pretty big increase year-over-year. And we see you keep expanding horizontally into new segments. We saw that with iStar this week. So how should we think about the forward run rate for fundraising credit given larger funds, wider offering, and also, some scale advantages on the distribution front, because I believe you will be doing new things on the retail side, too?\nCurtis Buser: Hey, Craig. It\u2019s Curt here. Just thanks for that question. Global Credit set up really well. So let me just kind of tick through some of the areas in starting with fundraising. So you look at kind of our past, it\u2019s been a nice tick up in fundraising, in Global Credit over sequential years something like $10 billion or $11 billion last year, $17 billion this year, and in our pending figure in AUM, which is about $16 billion. But the vast majority of that is global credit. And it\u2019ll turn on mostly as we deploy capital during next year and so that\u2019ll be an underpinning a lot of growth. Let\u2019s tick through some of the big components. First, the structure credit business, our CLO that business is just booming. So we issued 14 CLOs globally in 2021, which is currently managed about $34 billion in liquid credit strategies. That $14 billion of CLOs we issued is about $7.5 billion. And we think we\u2019re taking market share in this space that\u2019s really going to help underpin a lot of further growth in FRE in 2022, because you didn\u2019t get all the benefit of that FRE growth this past year, and so you\u2019re going to see more in that space. So activity in the CLO is really good. As Kew mentioned in his opening remarks, our opportunistic credit business is already at $8 billion deploying really well, all those fees, again, turn on as they deploy capital. So as that investment pace continues, more increase in revenues, so good space and opportunistic credit. In aviation business, boy, really nice, nearly a triple run rate and fee-related earnings. The size of that business has continued to go up, you\u2019ve seen some of these big transactions that they\u2019ve done a recent Fly a year-ago, and the big one this year. So look, they\u2019re now at about \u2013 they should be after all of this close, increasing their total AUM from about $8 billion as of the third quarter to more than $13 billion that all positions us to be able to triple the run rate of the FRE come out of that business. If you then \u2013 further think we got some newer products like CTAC, small, but growing really fast, really contributing to our results. Our direct lending business continues to do well and is growing. And then we\u2019ve got some new initiatives. So, as you point out, iStar transaction that was announced yesterday for real estate credit and also our infrastructure credit business. These are new platforms. The transaction yesterday really allows us to jumpstart what we think over time will be a big business. So I wouldn\u2019t have high expectations for this year in terms of driving earnings. We\u2019ve just gotten replaced in a really good spot where we have the AUM, the talent pool, and really the platform is now in place to really build a lot of it. So I think 2024 and thereafter, for when this business will really kind of really matter. So we\u2019re investing in long-term growth. From a firm capital perspective, it\u2019s about $200 million bucks in terms of firm capital. So I thought was a good use of firm capital related to achieve those outcomes. And let\u2019s not forget the adjacencies. So Fortitude and capital markets, big adjacencies in global private, they\u2019re also performing really well in driving growth. So hopefully that answers your question, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. That\u2019s helpful.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Craig. This is Kew. And really good to have you back with us here. The only thing I would add, and let me just take a step back. We\u2019re being very strategic and thoughtful in how we build out our credit business. It\u2019s a platform approach across big scalable strategies; you see how we\u2019re doing this. You\u2019ve been very patient with us, and it\u2019s really starting to pay off. The other thing I would say, as I talked to LPs, we\u2019re in the early innings here. Credit is relatively \u2013 private credit is relatively underpenetrated relative to private equity. There continues to be secular tailwinds and more flows are coming in and wanting private credit exposure. So we\u2019ve got great momentum. Curt touched on this. This is an asset class with products that fit particularly well to retail. It\u2019s an area where you can find permanent sources of capital, which we\u2019ve done now with our BDCs, and you noted that publicly. So we\u2019ve got great momentum. It is sustainable. These are sticky FRE businesses that that we think just keep growing, as we have secular tailwinds behind our platform.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Kew. And Kurt, I heard your commentary on forward to being a breakout year in 2022. So does this mean insurance M&A? Or is this really kind of robust more organic growth in the institutional B2B channel? I was just hoping you could articulate that comment, and it probably relates to some of the stuff you just said in credit.\nCurtis Buser: Yeah, so let me talk about Fortitude. First and foremost, that business is doing great. It\u2019s bigger, and it\u2019s better, at this point in time than what our expectations are. So let me step back a little bit, we completed the carve out, which was not easy to big business, really pleased with the management team, they\u2019re executing really well. They\u2019ve been able to execute a couple of acquisitions. The Prudential Assurance Life product that was announced in Q3, and then there\u2019s another big reinsurance contract that just got done. They have a great pipeline for future deals. All of that is \u2013 already \u2013 it has a fee run rate to Carlyle about $50 million to our business. And there\u2019s about $10 billion of total assets under management that are fee paying, 7 of which are invested directly into our funds, three of which is how we structured the actual Fortitude investment with our partners. So it\u2019s really set up well for further growth. The pipeline is there. And we think this is going to be an active year for that business in terms of future scale and good things are happening.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Curt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, thanks very much. So, Kew, I think you\u2019ve mentioned now a couple times and Curt, both, it sounds like the deal pipeline might be picking up and you have some good balance sheet. Could you maybe go down a layer and talk to where you think you might see an opportunity? I think last quarter, so you had mentioned you want to monetize and take the free cash flow from the realizations and drive FRE, I think permanent capital, I think I heard that again today. But can you talk a little bit maybe specifically, what segments or products you could see that opportunity playing through?\nKewsong Lee: Sure, Bill. Thanks for the question. I mean, look, take a step back, the criteria for us is we\u2019re looking for strategic adjacencies in big and scalable strategies that are going to be generative of FRE that can be great growth drivers for us in the years to come. Okay. So we\u2019re very focused and discipline on that. If you recall, back at Investor Day, which is about a year ago, I mentioned that I think the 2 best areas for this for us are going to be in the credit asset class and in the solutions business, which continues to grow very fast in our industry. We\u2019re already a dominant Global Private Equity player around the world. I think the bigger opportunities for scalability and FRE generation are going to come into credit asset class, and then into solutions for us. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, thanks. And then just to come back to the net realization guidance for the next couple of years. So sounds like it\u2019s up a little bit from the Investor Day, which is nice to hear. When I look sequentially, there\u2019s maybe 2 tactical view, but your net accrued carry balance actually dipped a little bit month \u2013 quarter to quarter. But when I look at some of your seasoning ratios like in-carry ratio, [you sent publics] [ph] and those age 4 years or more. Those also have slipped a little bit maybe it\u2019s quibbling. But how do you sort of triangulate between sort of appreciate 2020 was a great year to $1 billion sort of on average now, when you have sort of a bit of a less public portfolio loss being equal. Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: So, look, I really think that the overall platform is set up really well, the $5 billion that we generate a realized carry last year is far beyond, anyone\u2019s expectations, just a phenomenal year. And if you look at kind of on a go forward basis, I think, we can continue to do really well. And let\u2019s talk about some of those specifics. So we started the year not at $3.9 million. And in fact, if you look at last quarter to this quarter, the fact that we still had depreciation that we had to keep it essentially round the same $3.9 billion is pretty [dag gone good] [ph], when you realized $683 million in a quarter. Let\u2019s go back to Carlyle\u2019s big realization years from when we went public to 2017, $683 million of net realized performance revenues. That was an annual number. We did that in one border. And so, as we look going forward, I\u2019m very confident this $3.9 billion of accrued carry. But more importantly, is the $124 billion of invested capital in the ground remaining fair value. That number is about double what it was during the last cycle and it\u2019s 30% higher than at the beginning of this year, so all of the components to really be able to drive carry going forward are in place. So the in-carry ratio still really good like 75%, the amount that is still accrued despite really strong realizations, I feel really good about it. And you look at our GAAP numbers, even there. I mean, look at the GAAP EPS number, the nice forward indicator of things to come.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Bill. It\u2019s Kew. Great exit activity is a function of great investment activity and hard work that\u2019s gone into it 3 or 4 years prior. And our investment engine is really firing. And our deal teams, they\u2019re really performing, we\u2019re creating real value in our portfolios. And if you look at our investment pace, and our ability to deploy more, I mean $34 billion in 2021. That\u2019s really the forward indicator, the setup for what our earnings power is going to be 3, 4, 5 years hence, right? So the $3.9 billion of carry that we have now the fact that it stayed flat, despite record realizations talks to our business model, that we are driving great deployment and great portfolio company appreciation. So the engine is really working. Okay. So we\u2019re managing more money. We\u2019re investing more money. We\u2019re creating more value than ever before. And it\u2019s just going to be a matter of time before that comes out in our earnings over 3, 4 or 5 years.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Thank you both.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nChris Kotowski: Yeah, good morning and thank you. I wonder if you could give us a bit more color on the iStar transaction, just because I have a feeling this is kind of like a case study for your strategy of using balance sheet capital to try to drive FRE growth. So in the press release, it said that you acquired it for roughly $3 billion and you just said on the call that $200 million came from your balance sheet. So I\u2019m curious about the remaining $2.8 million. Does that come from a specifically raised third party vehicle? Or does it come from just ordinary funds across the board? And then, how should we think about in terms of the day one revenues that it generates at this level? And in the press release, you say you expect it to scale to $10 billion, what would it be at a mature fully platform level at that level kind of those \u2013 you can give some color around those things?\nCurtis Buser: Sure. So, Chris, I think it\u2019s a great question. And we\u2019re really pleased about the transaction. And really overall what\u2019s happening in credit just today kind of comment on a minute ago. The deal itself $3 billion purchase price really kind of setting us up for a good platform in real estate credit, it\u2019s one that we know well, the [Roger cost] [ph] just take the lead in all of this, really built that in the past, bring it over some of the people that he knows really well. So, from a personal perspective, really good from an asset perspective, we know the assets. It\u2019s levered transactions. So there it\u2019s about 2 to 1 1everage. And from an equity piece that was funded by some of our LPs, both in existing products and a strategic investor, and we\u2019re about 20%. The important part is will be the GP. So kind of think about this as fund structures, where the GP have that. This enables us over time to potentially use this to be in the retail channel. But more work to come on all of that. And it\u2019s going to take us, as I said before, 2 to 3 years before, this really culminates. But we need to make investments like this now to build a drive that kind of growth in 2024, 2025 and thereafter. So this is a good move for us as a firm and really jumpstart to what I think is going to be a very big business. Mark Jenkins, who runs this, said, look, he\u2019s looking to build a $10 billion business. And I know Mark pretty well and Mark\u2019s not going to stop at $10 billion.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes from Gerald O\u2019Hara with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Great. Thanks. Just maybe wanted to pick-up a little bit on the Investment Solutions business. Clearly, you see some kind of growing momentum there as it relates to net accrued revenue. But perhaps you could just kind of give us a little bit of an update on how that segment is evolving, and where you might see that kind of headed into next year?\nCurtis Buser: Gerry, hey, thanks for the question. Investment solutions, it\u2019s done really well. We\u2019ve doubled our FRE at $84 million this year, $37 million a year-ago. More importantly, this is in a very attractive space. So solutions products are really a good way for a lot of people to come into private equity and their performance is phenomenal, 48% this past year. They\u2019ve mastered really data and how to help LPs construct portfolios. And so they\u2019ve done a really nice job of that, and their deployment phase has been really good this year. You point out the recruit there. Obviously, that\u2019s a reflection of the 48% appreciation. And look, I think, we\u2019re well positioned for carry in that business to be realized carry to be a much bigger number. Now, you start to see some of that really coming in here in the fourth quarter, still small relative to overall Carlyle, but much bigger than what you\u2019ve seen before. Remind you that, this is all European style waterfalls. When we bought AlpInvest, we didn\u2019t buy the historical carry. And so it\u2019s really only on the funds then they\u2019re raised where the participation rates, right? So that\u2019s going to really start to play off 2023, 2024, 2025 is when those numbers most of that 320-ish of that accrued carry will really pop in those years, I think, you\u2019ll see a nice increase until that point for be those years where that number really comes through. In the meantime, Ruulke and the team are really working hard on ways to continue to grow that business, the secondary platform and the co-investment platform, our hot platforms. They\u2019re looking at other ways to kind of take advantage of what they know and do things. But more to come on that is that all kind of unfolds.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Gerry. It\u2019s Kew. The only the only high level thing I\u2019d add is, there\u2019s a theme that I introduced which is \u2013 or actually came with the first question which is under appreciation, I think our FRE strength is underappreciated. I think the diversity of our platform is underappreciated in the breadth of it. And quite frankly, I think people are starting to figure out AlpInvest, which is a leader in the solution space, a great brand, a great platform used to contribute, oh, probably, I don\u2019t know, $12 million, $13 million of FRE, 3, 4 years back. Now, it\u2019s closing it on $100 million. It\u2019s a strong platform, one of the market leaders, and that whole space just got real tailwinds in our industry, because as the Alps [ph] business has grown. CIOs and CEOs have these big plans, they need tools for better deployment portfolio optimization, and access to liquidity. And it just shows, it just talks to the maturation and the scale of what this industry has become. That this part of the industry now is as vibrant as it is with real growth and momentum behind it. So we\u2019ve got real \u2013 we feel really good about the prospects of AlpInvest. It\u2019s a great team, market leading. And I think like I said, we\u2019re underappreciated with respect to how important it is and what its opportunities for growth are within Carlyle.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, Kew sticking with you, and as it relates to sort of strategic opportunities. The other deal, I think that was announced was, I guess, a partnership with iCapital and Allfunds, perhaps you could comment a little bit about, how your vision into the kind of retail market would is expected to evolve, I guess, in the coming years? Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Yeah, let me jump in and take that. So look alternative sources of capital for us really include high net worth capital, retail, open-ended funds, permanent capital and insurance, and they\u2019re all additive to our efforts to drive growth. And we have a number of initiatives to in each of these areas, some of which we\u2019ve already talked about, and thanks for pointing out the iCapital announcement yesterday. It\u2019s another one of these initiatives that we think over time will be meaningful. We\u2019re an investor in iCapital. I wouldn\u2019t think that this is a major revelation. It\u2019s just additive to the overall process here. The bigger picture is the $51 billion that we raised this past year, double over raised the prior year, momentum is good. And it\u2019s diversified. It\u2019s diversified across all of our businesses. This coming year, we\u2019ll probably have about 20 different products in the market really enabling that strength and momentum to continue. And more importantly, feel really confident about our ability to drive FRE.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Thanks for taking the questions.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Gerry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning, guys.\nKewsong Lee: Good morning.\nPatrick Davitt: There\u2019s a view in the marketplace that private equity broadly has been one of the most boosted asset classes by this long period of central bank accommodation. So in that vein is now perhaps one of the more negatively exposed asset classes to this year\u2019s inflationary higher rate, less accommodative environment, particularly given the pivot to growth, a lot of firms appear to have taken. So could you give us your reaction to that perception and more specifically frame, which you think Carlyle\u2019s exposure as to what might be considered growth, your higher multiple positions in the PE portfolio?\nKewsong Lee: Sure. Hey, Patrick, great question. Obviously, this is something we\u2019re really everyone is focused on us especially. And, it\u2019s a question about rising rates; it\u2019s a question about volatility inflation, all in one. So let me try to address it. So first of all, with some of the correction that\u2019s happening in the market, and we\u2019re all seeing it the rotations that are occurring. Clearly, this will have an impact on marks. But I\u2019d like to point out, and Curt or Dan helped me out here. I think only 11% of our portfolio in public names right now. Is that correct?\nCurtis Buser: Correct.\nKewsong Lee: Okay. So about 11% of the names are in public names at the moment. But we really feel good about our portfolio construction very well diversified across industry sectors, big companies, smaller companies, across all regions. And that type of portfolio construction with our long-term orientation, where we don\u2019t have liquidity pressure, because of marks. It gives me real good comfort that over the long-term, our portfolio, it will be quite resilient as we enter a period of volatility. Now, if you think about some of the corrections we\u2019re seeing, especially with respect valuations. Quite frankly, on the buy side of the equation, we\u2019re meeting great companies, and the entry points are now more attractive. So I think longer term, this bodes well. And I\u2019m on record as saying, a healthy correction, not necessarily a bad thing with respect to our investment activity. So with a long term view, again, we have a view that as multiples trade down, it could be more attractive to us from an investment perspective. Turning to the credit business, I think folks have to appreciate a vast preponderance of our assets there are floating rate. Okay. So all else equal assuming economic backdrop is benign. A rising rates means that platform generates more profit. Okay. And then with respect to volatility, volatility with respect to the credit platform actually creates flow, especially in our special sitting credit opportunistic strategies. But more broadly speaking, I\u2019d say, Patrick, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, volatility creates change and change creates deal flow. And our platform is very broad. It\u2019s around the world. It\u2019s very diversified across strategies across industry sectors, and we\u2019ve been able to pivot really nicely over the past several years to finding opportunity. So as we enter this period of volatility, and make no doubt about it, we\u2019re not being complacent. We\u2019re studying what\u2019s happening very carefully. Of course, we\u2019re focused on inflation. Of course, we\u2019re focused on rising rates. Of course, we\u2019re carefully tracking markets. But volatility creates changes that are creating opportunities for a broad-based platform, especially with a long term lens. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the environment, and how we\u2019re positioned to navigate through it.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello, there. Quickie first. You talked about this great growth and 20 plus on FRE, which I think is very welcomed. Could we talk about the margin you plan \u2013 you talked about in the past about plans to increase that over time? I think you\u2019re scaling really well. I don\u2019t have to repeat all the things you said. Any specific thoughts on what you think the margin can be the next year or two? As the scale starts coming through?\nCurtis Buser: Glenn, it\u2019s Curt. So thanks for the question. In our Investor Day, we said we get the 40%, I\u2019ve not backed off of that target. That\u2019s for 2024. We grew from 30% beginning of this year to 33% for the full year this year, Q4 was 34%. We\u2019re really well positioned. Yeah, there\u2019s some increases in some costs in the fourth quarter, but our job is to grow the top-line faster than expenses and feel really comfortable with our ability to do that. I think you\u2019re going to see continued expansion and margin over the coming years. We\u2019ll hit the target in 2024.\nGlenn Schorr: I\u2019ll take the sooner on that, Curt. Okay, no problem.\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Glenn, it\u2019s Kew. I read your note this morning. Yes, 15 positives and only four negatives in your quick takeaway if I count it correctly.\nGlenn Schorr: Yes, it is. Question for you. I\u2019m curious if this is more theoretical, I guess. But if I look at your private equity business, it\u2019s big, it\u2019s global, it\u2019s been fully integrated. It\u2019s one team on dream, they share everything. I\u2019m curious, in credit, the growth is great, the capital raising is great, the performance great, everything that you pointed out. I\u2019m curious on how you\u2019re integrating it and whether or not it needs to be integrated meaning does each sub asset class stand on its own, raise capital on its own, go to LPs on its own, or underneath the covers years out, will it look just like private equity?\nKewsong Lee: Yeah. Glenn, it\u2019s a great question. And when I say and Curt says, we are taking a platform approach. We are being very intentional with that language. We have teams of investment professionals that are managing multiple strategies. And we have a credit distribution capability set that is raising money across our platform strategies and increasingly, we are also talking to LPs that are coming in to multiple strategies at the same time in SMAs and other type of structured programs. And so it is with real intention that we\u2019ve designed for the long-term, a strategy that is platform driven, it takes time to get that going build it the right way, and to have it really pay off, which is why you\u2019ve heard me from the very beginning several years back to ask for patience, I think it\u2019s starting to pay off, not only is the growth starting to happen, okay. And you\u2019re seeing that organically and also in organically, we\u2019re going to be very thoughtful and take our shots in organically, but you\u2019re seeing a consistent strategy on the platform. And what that means is, at some point in time, there\u2019s a tipping point where the AUM base and the revenue base starts to drop more earnings, because of the operating leverage that we\u2019ve created. Okay. That has not yet occurred to date. But we are approaching that tipping point, which is why we are keep alluding to the fact that that we think we\u2019re going to have a breakout year in credit as it relates to the FRE drop from all the growth that we\u2019ve been seeing, and that we expect to continue. So hopefully, that gives you a really good color, not only the strategic design of the platform, but what we think the business model will enable this to do from a financial perspective, no longer long-term, but in the short- to medium-term.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks for all that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Lee with KBW. Your line is open.\nRobert Lee: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess it\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s any more questions left at this point. But real quickly, on the capital markets business, I know it\u2019s a relatively small piece, but maybe this is another one of those underappreciated initiatives. Can you maybe just update us on that kind of your current expectations for that over the next couple of years, and you gave an update, obviously, in the Investor Day while back but just like to get another update?\nKewsong Lee: Sure. So look really pleased with how this initiative is really commenced and gone on. And it\u2019s a good example of people teaming together working across the entire platform. Brian Lindley, who quarterbacks this initiative, has really done a nice job of working with all of our credit and buyout professionals and also with our solutions teams. And just capitalizes really on the deep activity that we see around the globe and really looking to add value in anything and everything that they\u2019re involved in. So adding value is the cornerstone of that. The other pieces, obviously, deal flow really makes this business drive. And what you\u2019re already seeing is in total, we have about just shy of $100 million this year in transaction advisory fees with the vast majority of that coming from this capital markets activity. We\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s just been great in terms of what they\u2019ve been able to do this year. I think as we go forward, a lot of the learnings in terms of how to make all the internal workings work right how to have everyone incentivized right to work in coordinate together. Remember, we\u2019re not an investment bank. So I\u2019m not going after, other people\u2019s stuff. We\u2019re just trying to help them do the things that we\u2019re doing really well. So this has had a really nice trajectory. I think it will continue to grow. It\u2019ll be somewhat dependent upon capital markets activity and deal flow. But given that all that remains relatively strong, I think we\u2019ll continue to do some good things here. Hopefully, that\u2019s the color you need.\nRobert Lee: That was helpful. That was my only question. Thanks for your patience.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just wanted to circle back to retail more from a product angle, in the release yesterday, you mentioned [NFO funds] [ph] and BDCs sounds like you got a pretty full suite. So which of those is kind of gaining the most traction right now, anything that you expected in terms of getting traction, not getting traction? And finally, if there are any product gaps that you might have to fill in, or is it more about just expanding distribution at this point? Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: Good question. Look, as I said before, there\u2019s a number of alternative channels we\u2019re chasing and working on and we have initiatives in each of these, some of the \u2013 and I would just, say, look, a lot of this is not what we\u2019re dependent upon to drive the results that we\u2019re talking about the confidence that Kew expressed earlier is really from running the ship the way we\u2019ve been running it. And to the extent that we can execute really well on this, it\u2019s all going to be additive. So in terms of specific products, but we have a very good product within our credit business, we call it CTAC. And it\u2019s been growing really nicely, throwing off nice fees, because the performance there has been phenomenal and has been bringing in new investors. And so, I\u2019m optimistic about where that can go. We have a number of BDCs. They\u2019re performing well. Teams working really hard to ancillary products are around them, so that is also helpful. And there\u2019s new things in the works across the broader platform of the firm that we\u2019re working on, but it\u2019s still not really ready for primetime in terms of talking about in detail. Thanks.\nAdam Beatty: Got it. That\u2019s good detail. Appreciate it. And then just circling back, one of the phrases that kind of resonated in your prepared remarks, is picking your spots? And so just wondering if you could talk about spots, maybe that you didn\u2019t pick like certain opportunities either that other firms are doing, or maybe just opportunities that weren\u2019t a good fit for Carlyle, and how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: Look, where we\u2019re going to be picking our spots is, we\u2019ve now been focused on kind of building a big balance sheet, not for the sake of having a big balance sheet, because that gives value that not very much, but for the sake of being able to grow fee-related earnings. And so the iStar transaction that you saw is the start of what we\u2019re doing there, more to come, but we\u2019re focused on kind of, in particular, inorganic growth, but also then using that capital to grow a lot of our own internally developed initiatives, and expand in terms of getting bigger scale out of funds, and the like. So really see a way that we\u2019re going to be using our capital to grow the firm.\nAdam Beatty: Makes sense. Thank you very much.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, this is just some fine tuning from my model. When you look at your management fees, they had a significant bounce sequentially. And I appreciate your turn on a number of funds. Was there any catch-up fee in there? And as we look at the expense side, anything unusual on the cash comp or the G&A line as we think about in the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: So Bill, look on \u2013 probably on your revenue question on fee-management fees depends on how you\u2019re doing it. Remember, we turned on a number of funds here in the fourth quarter, not really catch up management fees, because we turn them on, there\u2019s nothing to catch up back to. This actually the fourth quarter, very light and catch-up management fees, very light the whole year, next year will be a little bit of a different story on catch-up management fees, I think you\u2019ll see a lot more in catch-up management fee next year, in part because when you turn it on early, and then you have a long fundraiser, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll have it. But in the fourth quarter, a higher effective fee rate if you\u2019re doing it off of an average of fee paying AUM beginning of the period, end of the period, the denominator will get distorted there. So just be careful if that\u2019s the math that you\u2019re doing. In terms of compensation, look, at the end of the year is the bonus period, we had just a great year really hit all of key records on really all the metrics like what our people were doing, and like their focus on driving FRE. And so, we pay them. And I feel good about that, and as you heard, Kew and I talked about we\u2019re very confident about our ability to drive growth, and drive FRE and continue to be focused on margin and running the firm effectively and efficiently. And I think that also makes sense in the current market where talent and attracting and retaining top talent is important. On G&A. Yeah, well, G&A pops all over, as you guys know, as you\u2019ve followed us. For the full year, we\u2019re about 270, which is about the same as last year when you adjust for the litigation cost recoveries. Fourth quarter did have some investments that were being made and some new initiatives and legal costs associated with that some extra fundraising costs. Actually, I hope that kind of continues, because that\u2019s really kind of what fuels long-term growth. And then, we have some compliance costs that tend to be back in, because tax returns and all that kind of nonsense occurs more at the end of the year. And so you end up with a bit of more profit at that point in time. So hopefully that gives you some color on how that plays through.\nWilliam Katz: Yeah, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I\u2019m currently showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Daniel Harris for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, everyone, for your time today. Should you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations at any time. Otherwise, we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as provide line of sight into 2022. We started last year by laying out our strategic plan for future growth, and I'm pleased to tell you that we are delivering on our goals. We had an exceptional 2021 with records across the board and fee-related earnings, distributable earnings and every major investment metric. I'm proud of our people and the results they have collectively produced. Our fourth quarter performance caps this strong year and illustrates the powerful growth trajectory across a more diversified platform. I want to highlight the key drivers underpinning our record year. As our FRE has grown to new sustainable levels, our growth initiatives are starting to payoff, and our performance has set the stage for robust distributable earnings over the next several years. Let's start by underscoring our investment performance with valuations increasing 41% year-over-year and realizations of $44 billion across all of our traditional carry funds. Portfolio construction continues to be a strength, especially as we enter a period of greater volatility. We're investing more capital as we expand our aperture and leverage even more effectively our global scale and sector expertise. This has resulted in record investment activity. We deployed $14 billion in Q4 alone, and $34 billion in 2021, each a record. This investment performed ability to send realized proceeds back to our limited partners has helped their fundraising efforts. In 2021, we raised $51 billion nearly double what we've raised in 2020. We aim to continue this momentum over the next few years as we focus on the substantial upside potential to our Investor Day target, which would help us drive financial results beyond our FRE ambitions. Alternative sources of capital formation such as high net worth, retail, open-ended funds, permanent capital and insurance represent upside and are an increasing source of fundraising dollars as we pick our spots to grow these sources of capital. Stepping back, the headline is, we ended 2021 with strong fundraising momentum that will carry over into 2022. Our extraordinary performance across the board has established a new level of earnings power, which gives us the confidence to raise our dividend substantially. You'll hear more on this from Curt later. More importantly, this performance also gives us the resources to continue investing strategically to build the firm and accelerate growth. Now turning to strategic growth opportunities, our investments in Global Credit are paying off, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. For example, our credit opportunity strategy has grown to $8 billion in about 4 years, and with Carlyle Aviation, we expect FRE to triple in 3 years since the acquisition. The growth continues with our energy now focused on building out infrastructure credit, which we are doing organically and jumpstarting growth in real estate credit. Another scalable platform initiative is Fortitude, which continues to progress as planned. And given the current activity level and pipeline, we are confident that 2022 could be a breakout year for this very scalable permanent capital platform. Several years ago, we asked for patience as we rebuilt our global credit platform. We're using the same playbook in other areas like infrastructure and renewables, where we see significant room for growth, and similar to Fortitude anticipate an active year. Finally, our focus on building the firm includes investment and leadership and impact and ESG capabilities, which are increasingly required to drive returns and meet the needs of our LPs. At Carlyle, ESG is not one fund or product, but a part of everything we do. One example is the ESG data convergence project announced in partnership with CalPERS in September 2021, which has reached a milestone commitment of over 100 leading GPs and LPs globally to its partnership, representing $8.7 trillion in AUM, and over 1,400 underlying portfolio companies. And just this week, Carlyle took another important step as one of the first in our industry to announce its commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner across direct investments. By integrating an ESG mindset across the firm in our investment processes and throughout our value creation, our approach benefits all stakeholders. To wrap up, we enter 2022 better position than ever before. Carlyle is a stronger and healthier firm today because of our 2021 progress. Our focus remains on continuously improving how we drive value in generating attractive returns. And we're confident in our ability to grow FRE, drive investment performance, and strategically build the firm for future growth. We are focused on building the best investment firm possible and running it better than ever before. As the environment continually shifts around us, our diversified investment platform and global team have demonstrated resilience and adaptability. I remain confident in our ability to thrive and capture opportunities in any environment. I'm proud of our team, and we remain focused on continuing to deliver for shareholders and all stakeholders. I appreciate the hard work as we accelerate our activity for another very active year of executing on our vision of thinking bigger, moving faster and performing better. Over to you, Curt. Yeah, good morning, Alex. Look, I'm really confident. And importantly, the entire team is confident in our momentum, and the fact that we're going to keep this going. Look, the FRE has already been growing 20% a year for the past five years, I think, that's mostly gone unnoticed. And if you get a little bit more granular, if you look at Q4, we generated $174 million of FRE, that run rate multiply that by 4, it already positions us for a strong year of FRE growth in 2022. And that's before additional upside from our activities that we've got underway. Look, with respect to business building, I think you touched on it in your note this morning, and it's the right place to look. Our Global Credit business is about to have a breakout year, we've talked to you about the fundraising, it's got over $70 billion of AUM raised $17 billion last year, but really the thing to look at all the patients in building that business, this is the year where I think operating leverage really starts to kick in. And I think off of that growth, more is going to fall to the bottom line with respect to FRE. And then turning to our incredible investment performance. It's across the board and despite the record realizations we had, we still have about $4 billion of net accrued carry balances. It's very diversified across regions, across sectors across funds. For me \u2013 for us, it's not a question of, if this comes out, but when it comes out, as Curt alluded to in his comments. And then let me just address, the broader base momentum we have on fundraising. So we pointed out $51 billion of fundraising, I want to note, two-thirds of that was away from corporate private equity, healthy fundraising in U.S. real estate, in solutions, in credit, it's broad-based across all segments. And I point that out, because, I think folks on appreciating that we're much more diversified and it's a much broader business and a platform than ever before. Now, of course, this is all before the fact that our balance sheet is about as strong as it's ever been. And, I'm very focused on driving the firm into new strategic adjacencies in markets that are large, that are scalable, and that can be very FRE generative. So when you throw that all together, yeah, I'm really confident. And the last piece to all this, you need a great team, this team is executing. So all of that is what gives me confidence that this is going to continue. Hey, Craig, nice to hear from you. Hey, Craig. This is Kew. And really good to have you back with us here. The only thing I would add, and let me just take a step back. We're being very strategic and thoughtful in how we build out our credit business. It's a platform approach across big scalable strategies; you see how we're doing this. You've been very patient with us, and it's really starting to pay off. The other thing I would say, as I talked to LPs, we're in the early innings here. Credit is relatively \u2013 private credit is relatively underpenetrated relative to private equity. There continues to be secular tailwinds and more flows are coming in and wanting private credit exposure. So we've got great momentum. Curt touched on this. This is an asset class with products that fit particularly well to retail. It's an area where you can find permanent sources of capital, which we've done now with our BDCs, and you noted that publicly. So we've got great momentum. It is sustainable. These are sticky FRE businesses that that we think just keep growing, as we have secular tailwinds behind our platform. Sure, Bill. Thanks for the question. I mean, look, take a step back, the criteria for us is we're looking for strategic adjacencies in big and scalable strategies that are going to be generative of FRE that can be great growth drivers for us in the years to come. Okay. So we're very focused and discipline on that. If you recall, back at Investor Day, which is about a year ago, I mentioned that I think the 2 best areas for this for us are going to be in the credit asset class and in the solutions business, which continues to grow very fast in our industry. We're already a dominant Global Private Equity player around the world. I think the bigger opportunities for scalability and FRE generation are going to come into credit asset class, and then into solutions for us. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color. Hey, Bill. It's Kew. Great exit activity is a function of great investment activity and hard work that's gone into it 3 or 4 years prior. And our investment engine is really firing. And our deal teams, they're really performing, we're creating real value in our portfolios. And if you look at our investment pace, and our ability to deploy more, I mean $34 billion in 2021. That's really the forward indicator, the setup for what our earnings power is going to be 3, 4, 5 years hence, right? So the $3.9 billion of carry that we have now the fact that it stayed flat, despite record realizations talks to our business model, that we are driving great deployment and great portfolio company appreciation. So the engine is really working. Okay. So we're managing more money. We're investing more money. We're creating more value than ever before. And it's just going to be a matter of time before that comes out in our earnings over 3, 4 or 5 years. Thanks, Bill. Hey, Gerry. It's Kew. The only the only high level thing I'd add is, there's a theme that I introduced which is \u2013 or actually came with the first question which is under appreciation, I think our FRE strength is underappreciated. I think the diversity of our platform is underappreciated in the breadth of it. And quite frankly, I think people are starting to figure out AlpInvest, which is a leader in the solution space, a great brand, a great platform used to contribute, oh, probably, I don't know, $12 million, $13 million of FRE, 3, 4 years back. Now, it's closing it on $100 million. It's a strong platform, one of the market leaders, and that whole space just got real tailwinds in our industry, because as the Alps [ph] business has grown. CIOs and CEOs have these big plans, they need tools for better deployment portfolio optimization, and access to liquidity. And it just shows, it just talks to the maturation and the scale of what this industry has become. That this part of the industry now is as vibrant as it is with real growth and momentum behind it. So we've got real \u2013 we feel really good about the prospects of AlpInvest. It's a great team, market leading. And I think like I said, we're underappreciated with respect to how important it is and what its opportunities for growth are within Carlyle. Yeah, let me jump in and take that. So look alternative sources of capital for us really include high net worth capital, retail, open-ended funds, permanent capital and insurance, and they're all additive to our efforts to drive growth. And we have a number of initiatives to in each of these areas, some of which we've already talked about, and thanks for pointing out the iCapital announcement yesterday. It's another one of these initiatives that we think over time will be meaningful. We're an investor in iCapital. I wouldn't think that this is a major revelation. It's just additive to the overall process here. The bigger picture is the $51 billion that we raised this past year, double over raised the prior year, momentum is good. And it's diversified. It's diversified across all of our businesses. This coming year, we'll probably have about 20 different products in the market really enabling that strength and momentum to continue. And more importantly, feel really confident about our ability to drive FRE. Thanks, Gerry. Good morning. Sure. Hey, Patrick, great question. Obviously, this is something we're really everyone is focused on us especially. And, it's a question about rising rates; it's a question about volatility inflation, all in one. So let me try to address it. So first of all, with some of the correction that's happening in the market, and we're all seeing it the rotations that are occurring. Clearly, this will have an impact on marks. But I'd like to point out, and Curt or Dan helped me out here. I think only 11% of our portfolio in public names right now. Is that correct? Okay. So about 11% of the names are in public names at the moment. But we really feel good about our portfolio construction very well diversified across industry sectors, big companies, smaller companies, across all regions. And that type of portfolio construction with our long-term orientation, where we don't have liquidity pressure, because of marks. It gives me real good comfort that over the long-term, our portfolio, it will be quite resilient as we enter a period of volatility. Now, if you think about some of the corrections we're seeing, especially with respect valuations. Quite frankly, on the buy side of the equation, we're meeting great companies, and the entry points are now more attractive. So I think longer term, this bodes well. And I'm on record as saying, a healthy correction, not necessarily a bad thing with respect to our investment activity. So with a long term view, again, we have a view that as multiples trade down, it could be more attractive to us from an investment perspective. Turning to the credit business, I think folks have to appreciate a vast preponderance of our assets there are floating rate. Okay. So all else equal assuming economic backdrop is benign. A rising rates means that platform generates more profit. Okay. And then with respect to volatility, volatility with respect to the credit platform actually creates flow, especially in our special sitting credit opportunistic strategies. But more broadly speaking, I'd say, Patrick, there's one thing I've learned, volatility creates change and change creates deal flow. And our platform is very broad. It's around the world. It's very diversified across strategies across industry sectors, and we've been able to pivot really nicely over the past several years to finding opportunity. So as we enter this period of volatility, and make no doubt about it, we're not being complacent. We're studying what's happening very carefully. Of course, we're focused on inflation. Of course, we're focused on rising rates. Of course, we're carefully tracking markets. But volatility creates changes that are creating opportunities for a broad-based platform, especially with a long term lens. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the environment, and how we're positioned to navigate through it. Hey, Glenn, it's Kew. I read your note this morning. Yes, 15 positives and only four negatives in your quick takeaway if I count it correctly. Yeah. Glenn, it's a great question. And when I say and Curt says, we are taking a platform approach. We are being very intentional with that language. We have teams of investment professionals that are managing multiple strategies. And we have a credit distribution capability set that is raising money across our platform strategies and increasingly, we are also talking to LPs that are coming in to multiple strategies at the same time in SMAs and other type of structured programs. And so it is with real intention that we've designed for the long-term, a strategy that is platform driven, it takes time to get that going build it the right way, and to have it really pay off, which is why you've heard me from the very beginning several years back to ask for patience, I think it's starting to pay off, not only is the growth starting to happen, okay. And you're seeing that organically and also in organically, we're going to be very thoughtful and take our shots in organically, but you're seeing a consistent strategy on the platform. And what that means is, at some point in time, there's a tipping point where the AUM base and the revenue base starts to drop more earnings, because of the operating leverage that we've created. Okay. That has not yet occurred to date. But we are approaching that tipping point, which is why we are keep alluding to the fact that that we think we're going to have a breakout year in credit as it relates to the FRE drop from all the growth that we've been seeing, and that we expect to continue. So hopefully, that gives you a really good color, not only the strategic design of the platform, but what we think the business model will enable this to do from a financial perspective, no longer long-term, but in the short- to medium-term. Sure. So look really pleased with how this initiative is really commenced and gone on. And it's a good example of people teaming together working across the entire platform. Brian Lindley, who quarterbacks this initiative, has really done a nice job of working with all of our credit and buyout professionals and also with our solutions teams. And just capitalizes really on the deep activity that we see around the globe and really looking to add value in anything and everything that they're involved in. So adding value is the cornerstone of that. The other pieces, obviously, deal flow really makes this business drive. And what you're already seeing is in total, we have about just shy of $100 million this year in transaction advisory fees with the vast majority of that coming from this capital markets activity. We've \u2013 it's just been great in terms of what they've been able to do this year. I think as we go forward, a lot of the learnings in terms of how to make all the internal workings work right how to have everyone incentivized right to work in coordinate together. Remember, we're not an investment bank. So I'm not going after, other people's stuff. We're just trying to help them do the things that we're doing really well. So this has had a really nice trajectory. I think it will continue to grow. It'll be somewhat dependent upon capital markets activity and deal flow. But given that all that remains relatively strong, I think we'll continue to do some good things here. Hopefully, that's the color you need. Thanks, Rob."

            "name": "Curtis Buser",
            "content": "Thanks, Kew, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by reiterating many things Kew mentioned to emphasize what our strong performance this year means. We generated over $5 per share in distributable earnings in 2021, well more than double the average generated in the last 5 years. In fact, the fourth quarters $2.01 per share would have exceeded the full year in 4 of the past 5 years. These results are driven by attractive investment performance, and are fortifying our balance sheet to help us deliver long-term sustainable growth in our global platform and fee-related earnings. Let's dive deeper into all of this. This year we focused on delivering strong, sustainable and growing fee-related earnings. 2021 was a record year for the firm's overall FRE, every segment generated record FRE, and our full-year FRE margin grew to 33%, up from 30% in 2020. In fact, FRE grew more than 20% off the adjusted level in 2020 and our 5-year FRE CAGR is 24%. This is the outcome of scaling our platform and positioning Carlyle for growth. As Kew noted, we also had a record year for fundraising, and much of that will have a stronger impact on fee-related earnings in 2022. Record fundraising of $51 billion along with strong fund performance to help drive total assets under management, up 22% over the past year. As we look ahead, we will continue to focus on running the firm effectively and efficiently. On an organic basis, we expect to see FRE growth of more than 20% in 2022 driven by strong top-line growth. 2021 fundraising underpins much of our expected growth in 2022. Notably, we activated fees on our new U.S. buyout and growth capital funds, as well as our most recent U.S. real estate fund, all in Q4, elevating fee revenues in the fourth quarter and setting the stage for higher fee revenues this year. In addition, we expect to see a breakout year for global credit in 2022. The business has $73 billion in assets under management as of year-end, more than 2 times larger than it was less than 4 years ago, underpinned by nearly $17 billion in fundraising in 2021 for a broad spectrum of strategies, as many investors continue to shift away from traditional fixed income to private credit opportunities. This segment has several scaled products, structured credit, opportunistic credit, direct lending and aviation as well as several newer products in infrastructure and real estate credit, including the recent iStar transaction that will close in the coming weeks that are all well positioned for growth. Our Global Investment Solutions business has the scale global reach and data to help fund investors continually reassess and reconstruct their portfolios in pursuit of capturing returns. In a world where private capitals become mainstream, and a significant portion of our investor portfolios, this approach is more important than ever before, and is able to this business to more than double FRE to $84 million from $37 million just a year-ago. Performance has also been impressive with appreciation of 48% in 2021, and net accrued performance revenues of $390 million at year end, more than double from a year-ago. Our Global Private Equity business is a diversified business with platform supporting corporate private equity, real estate, infrastructure and natural resources all on a global basis. In corporate private equity, we're a builder of businesses pulling more value creation levers than ever helping companies reinvent their business models and drive growth. You can see the results of this work in our record net realized performance revenues. Just in the fourth quarter Global Private Equity realized $10 billion in proceeds fueled by exits in PPD, PK, CoreSite, and the sale of more than $1 billion of ZoomInfo. As Kew said earlier, this success is a function of our investment in teams, technology, diversity and platforms. We have $124 billion in remaining fair value of invested assets in just our traditional carry funds, which ended the year up 30% year-over-year, and positioned us for continued to significant realizations in the future. 2021 was a special year with over $1.5 billion in net realized performance revenues, which will be difficult to replicate. But we believe 2022 will be another strong year, we should realize on average $1 billion over each of the next several years. Of course, in any given year, the health of the global markets is likely to drive variants the upside or downside around that expectation. Finally, I'd like to spend some time on the strength of our balance sheet. After prepaying $250 million over 2023 bonds, our balance sheet reflects $2.5 billion in cash and $2.1 billion in firm investments. To put the cash balance in perspective, cash increased nearly $1.5 billion from a year-ago. In 2021, we generated realized investment income of $210 million from our balance sheet investments are nearly triple what we earned the previous year. Again, this level of income realizations may not be easy to replicate, but we believe that we should routinely generate investment income at levels of $150 million or more per year on average. Our strong cash position, an expectation for elevated earnings positioned us to deploy our capital as we previously discussed. This includes investing in next generation funds and new strategies, growing our adjacencies, pursuing accretive inorganic growth. We see various opportunities to drive shareholder value resulting from the improved strength of our balance sheet. Our credit ratings at both S&P and Fitch are on a positive watch for potential upgrade, highlighting the upward trajectory of our firm and our financial footing. The strength of our balance sheet along with a significant increase in FRE in 2021 allows the board to comfortably and sustainably raise our fixed dividend to $1.30 for 2022, a 30% increase. The higher dividend will begin with Q1. As we continue to grow FRE from here, and as we laid out in our strategic plan, we expect we will be able to raise the dividend further in coming years. We're outperforming our own expectations and believe we are well positioned to do so for the next several years. Our strong momentum is allowing us to grow our fee-related earnings and distribute earnings and invest in Carlyle's longer-term growth. We are creating exceptional value for shareholders and we will continue to deliver on this growth in 2022. Now, let me turn the call over to the operator, so we can take your questions. Alex, thanks for that. This is Curt. Let me take that. So first, compensation structures, as you point out, are really important in driving behavior. And we feel good about our structures, and how they're aligned for stakeholders across all investment cycles. Of course, we're always thinking about compensation and alignment, and how to better align compensation of our professionals with that of our shareholders, and performance. Because what you pay for is likely we're going to be what you get. At the same time, we do believe in pay for performance, and have been consistent in saying that our split our performance compensation shows strong alignment with limited partners on carry and fund performance with shareholders on driving fee-related earnings, and using the firm capital to build our retained earnings. So that's important for driving future growth. We're going to continue to grow our business and earnings that's what we're focused on. We've been doing that really well as Kew just outlined have great confidence in the future. And to the extent that we decided to make any changes in our compensation models, we'll let you know. But the bottom line is we believe in alignment. Great. Nice to hear from you. Hey, Craig. It's Curt here. Just thanks for that question. Global Credit set up really well. So let me just kind of tick through some of the areas in starting with fundraising. So you look at kind of our past, it's been a nice tick up in fundraising, in Global Credit over sequential years something like $10 billion or $11 billion last year, $17 billion this year, and in our pending figure in AUM, which is about $16 billion. But the vast majority of that is global credit. And it'll turn on mostly as we deploy capital during next year and so that'll be an underpinning a lot of growth. Let's tick through some of the big components. First, the structure credit business, our CLO that business is just booming. So we issued 14 CLOs globally in 2021, which is currently managed about $34 billion in liquid credit strategies. That $14 billion of CLOs we issued is about $7.5 billion. And we think we're taking market share in this space that's really going to help underpin a lot of further growth in FRE in 2022, because you didn't get all the benefit of that FRE growth this past year, and so you're going to see more in that space. So activity in the CLO is really good. As Kew mentioned in his opening remarks, our opportunistic credit business is already at $8 billion deploying really well, all those fees, again, turn on as they deploy capital. So as that investment pace continues, more increase in revenues, so good space and opportunistic credit. In aviation business, boy, really nice, nearly a triple run rate and fee-related earnings. The size of that business has continued to go up, you've seen some of these big transactions that they've done a recent Fly a year-ago, and the big one this year. So look, they're now at about \u2013 they should be after all of this close, increasing their total AUM from about $8 billion as of the third quarter to more than $13 billion that all positions us to be able to triple the run rate of the FRE come out of that business. If you then \u2013 further think we got some newer products like CTAC, small, but growing really fast, really contributing to our results. Our direct lending business continues to do well and is growing. And then we've got some new initiatives. So, as you point out, iStar transaction that was announced yesterday for real estate credit and also our infrastructure credit business. These are new platforms. The transaction yesterday really allows us to jumpstart what we think over time will be a big business. So I wouldn't have high expectations for this year in terms of driving earnings. We've just gotten replaced in a really good spot where we have the AUM, the talent pool, and really the platform is now in place to really build a lot of it. So I think 2024 and thereafter, for when this business will really kind of really matter. So we're investing in long-term growth. From a firm capital perspective, it's about $200 million bucks in terms of firm capital. So I thought was a good use of firm capital related to achieve those outcomes. And let's not forget the adjacencies. So Fortitude and capital markets, big adjacencies in global private, they're also performing really well in driving growth. So hopefully that answers your question, Craig. Yeah, so let me talk about Fortitude. First and foremost, that business is doing great. It's bigger, and it's better, at this point in time than what our expectations are. So let me step back a little bit, we completed the carve out, which was not easy to big business, really pleased with the management team, they're executing really well. They've been able to execute a couple of acquisitions. The Prudential Assurance Life product that was announced in Q3, and then there's another big reinsurance contract that just got done. They have a great pipeline for future deals. All of that is \u2013 already \u2013 it has a fee run rate to Carlyle about $50 million to our business. And there's about $10 billion of total assets under management that are fee paying, 7 of which are invested directly into our funds, three of which is how we structured the actual Fortitude investment with our partners. So it's really set up well for further growth. The pipeline is there. And we think this is going to be an active year for that business in terms of future scale and good things are happening. So, look, I really think that the overall platform is set up really well, the $5 billion that we generate a realized carry last year is far beyond, anyone's expectations, just a phenomenal year. And if you look at kind of on a go forward basis, I think, we can continue to do really well. And let's talk about some of those specifics. So we started the year not at $3.9 million. And in fact, if you look at last quarter to this quarter, the fact that we still had depreciation that we had to keep it essentially round the same $3.9 billion is pretty [dag gone good] [ph], when you realized $683 million in a quarter. Let's go back to Carlyle's big realization years from when we went public to 2017, $683 million of net realized performance revenues. That was an annual number. We did that in one border. And so, as we look going forward, I'm very confident this $3.9 billion of accrued carry. But more importantly, is the $124 billion of invested capital in the ground remaining fair value. That number is about double what it was during the last cycle and it's 30% higher than at the beginning of this year, so all of the components to really be able to drive carry going forward are in place. So the in-carry ratio still really good like 75%, the amount that is still accrued despite really strong realizations, I feel really good about it. And you look at our GAAP numbers, even there. I mean, look at the GAAP EPS number, the nice forward indicator of things to come. Sure. So, Chris, I think it's a great question. And we're really pleased about the transaction. And really overall what's happening in credit just today kind of comment on a minute ago. The deal itself $3 billion purchase price really kind of setting us up for a good platform in real estate credit, it's one that we know well, the [Roger cost] [ph] just take the lead in all of this, really built that in the past, bring it over some of the people that he knows really well. So, from a personal perspective, really good from an asset perspective, we know the assets. It's levered transactions. So there it's about 2 to 1 1everage. And from an equity piece that was funded by some of our LPs, both in existing products and a strategic investor, and we're about 20%. The important part is will be the GP. So kind of think about this as fund structures, where the GP have that. This enables us over time to potentially use this to be in the retail channel. But more work to come on all of that. And it's going to take us, as I said before, 2 to 3 years before, this really culminates. But we need to make investments like this now to build a drive that kind of growth in 2024, 2025 and thereafter. So this is a good move for us as a firm and really jumpstart to what I think is going to be a very big business. Mark Jenkins, who runs this, said, look, he's looking to build a $10 billion business. And I know Mark pretty well and Mark's not going to stop at $10 billion. Thanks, Chris. Gerry, hey, thanks for the question. Investment solutions, it's done really well. We've doubled our FRE at $84 million this year, $37 million a year-ago. More importantly, this is in a very attractive space. So solutions products are really a good way for a lot of people to come into private equity and their performance is phenomenal, 48% this past year. They've mastered really data and how to help LPs construct portfolios. And so they've done a really nice job of that, and their deployment phase has been really good this year. You point out the recruit there. Obviously, that's a reflection of the 48% appreciation. And look, I think, we're well positioned for carry in that business to be realized carry to be a much bigger number. Now, you start to see some of that really coming in here in the fourth quarter, still small relative to overall Carlyle, but much bigger than what you've seen before. Remind you that, this is all European style waterfalls. When we bought AlpInvest, we didn't buy the historical carry. And so it's really only on the funds then they're raised where the participation rates, right? So that's going to really start to play off 2023, 2024, 2025 is when those numbers most of that 320-ish of that accrued carry will really pop in those years, I think, you'll see a nice increase until that point for be those years where that number really comes through. In the meantime, Ruulke and the team are really working hard on ways to continue to grow that business, the secondary platform and the co-investment platform, our hot platforms. They're looking at other ways to kind of take advantage of what they know and do things. But more to come on that is that all kind of unfolds. Correct. Glenn, it's Curt. So thanks for the question. In our Investor Day, we said we get the 40%, I've not backed off of that target. That's for 2024. We grew from 30% beginning of this year to 33% for the full year this year, Q4 was 34%. We're really well positioned. Yeah, there's some increases in some costs in the fourth quarter, but our job is to grow the top-line faster than expenses and feel really comfortable with our ability to do that. I think you're going to see continued expansion and margin over the coming years. We'll hit the target in 2024. Good question. Look, as I said before, there's a number of alternative channels we're chasing and working on and we have initiatives in each of these, some of the \u2013 and I would just, say, look, a lot of this is not what we're dependent upon to drive the results that we're talking about the confidence that Kew expressed earlier is really from running the ship the way we've been running it. And to the extent that we can execute really well on this, it's all going to be additive. So in terms of specific products, but we have a very good product within our credit business, we call it CTAC. And it's been growing really nicely, throwing off nice fees, because the performance there has been phenomenal and has been bringing in new investors. And so, I'm optimistic about where that can go. We have a number of BDCs. They're performing well. Teams working really hard to ancillary products are around them, so that is also helpful. And there's new things in the works across the broader platform of the firm that we're working on, but it's still not really ready for primetime in terms of talking about in detail. Thanks. Look, where we're going to be picking our spots is, we've now been focused on kind of building a big balance sheet, not for the sake of having a big balance sheet, because that gives value that not very much, but for the sake of being able to grow fee-related earnings. And so the iStar transaction that you saw is the start of what we're doing there, more to come, but we're focused on kind of, in particular, inorganic growth, but also then using that capital to grow a lot of our own internally developed initiatives, and expand in terms of getting bigger scale out of funds, and the like. So really see a way that we're going to be using our capital to grow the firm. Thanks. So Bill, look on \u2013 probably on your revenue question on fee-management fees depends on how you're doing it. Remember, we turned on a number of funds here in the fourth quarter, not really catch up management fees, because we turn them on, there's nothing to catch up back to. This actually the fourth quarter, very light and catch-up management fees, very light the whole year, next year will be a little bit of a different story on catch-up management fees, I think you'll see a lot more in catch-up management fee next year, in part because when you turn it on early, and then you have a long fundraiser, that's where you'll have it. But in the fourth quarter, a higher effective fee rate if you're doing it off of an average of fee paying AUM beginning of the period, end of the period, the denominator will get distorted there. So just be careful if that's the math that you're doing. In terms of compensation, look, at the end of the year is the bonus period, we had just a great year really hit all of key records on really all the metrics like what our people were doing, and like their focus on driving FRE. And so, we pay them. And I feel good about that, and as you heard, Kew and I talked about we're very confident about our ability to drive growth, and drive FRE and continue to be focused on margin and running the firm effectively and efficiently. And I think that also makes sense in the current market where talent and attracting and retaining top talent is important. On G&A. Yeah, well, G&A pops all over, as you guys know, as you've followed us. For the full year, we're about 270, which is about the same as last year when you adjust for the litigation cost recoveries. Fourth quarter did have some investments that were being made and some new initiatives and legal costs associated with that some extra fundraising costs. Actually, I hope that kind of continues, because that's really kind of what fuels long-term growth. And then, we have some compliance costs that tend to be back in, because tax returns and all that kind of nonsense occurs more at the end of the year. And so you end up with a bit of more profit at that point in time. So hopefully that gives you some color on how that plays through."

Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle\u2019s Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our IR website. It updates the progress we\u2019ve made and the momentum we are building on our strategic plan to think bigger, move faster and perform better that we announced at the beginning of the year.  For the third quarter, we generated $151 million in fee-related earnings and $731 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $1.54. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. I know it\u2019s a busy morning, so to ensure participation by all those on the call, limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up and then return to the queue for any additional questions. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Dan. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to have another opportunity to update you on the great progress we are making against the strategic plan and a record firm-wide earnings performance we delivered this quarter. Our third quarter results are exceptional across all three of our businesses with continued and sustainable progress in FRE, highest production of quarterly distributable earnings ever, and strong fundraising momentum These results build upon a great first half of the year and illustrate the powerful upward long-term growth trajectory our diversified platform can deliver. As an update, let me start with three important points. First, we are ahead of schedule on our strategic plan across all of our businesses. Second, our focus on FRE and investment performance is paying off for all stakeholders.  And finally, one critical factor in this success is that we have built and aligned diverse and experienced leadership who are running our global firm. Thinking bigger, moving faster, and performing better is our mantra. It is helping us deliver on our priorities. Our strategic plan is already leading to strong results right out of the gate and more importantly, we believe it positions us to deliver continued earnings growth and strong investment performance over the long-term.  The second and third quarters were record breakers for us and we see continued growth from here. Just this quarter, we achieved record AUM of $293 billion and year-to-date we invested a record $20 billion and realized a record $29 billion. What we\u2019ll describe to you today reflects our progress and we remain laser focused on continuing to execute our longer term goals. We have line of sight into how our strategic plan will generate growth and believe we can continue our momentum to deliver attractive results for our stakeholders.  As we generate an increasing level of retained earnings from strong DE over the next several quarters, we are actively assessing opportunities to invest in our platform to drive more sustainable FRE growth that expands on our strengths. We continue to build the team and infrastructure to ensure we are best positioned to pursue the right growth opportunities for Carlyle.  I am confident that we can grow both organically and through strategic acquisitions to diversify our businesses, build new drivers for future growth and increase our sustainable level of FRE.  Today, as you listen and analyze our results and commentary, please pay close attention to the accelerating activity across all three of our global businesses. We are investing, creating value, returning capital to realizations and fundraising that levels that drive line of sight to accelerating growth and earnings.  In regard to our investing, we see significant growth opportunities ahead. The reason is this, massive changes impacting industries and asset classes around the world in generating exceptional investment opportunities for private markets, which is the backdrop for our record investment pace. And our industry continues to deliver investment outperformance as demonstrated by Carlyle\u2019s carry fund appreciation of 33% year-to-date.  Furthermore, we are better competitively positioned than ever before. As a global and diversified investment firm operating at scale, our platform approach enables us to capture opportunities by deploying capital to the sectors and regions of the global economy that are the most attractive. Businesses in these sectors are benefiting from the acceleration of disruptive change and we are capturing these opportunities across all of our investment strategies and investing capital more efficiently.  We are especially focused on trends that are converging, namely in key sectors of the economy like healthcare, where technology continues to generate growth in societal advances. We are also leaning into more traditional power allies like industrials and consumer, but we are bringing a modern approach to incumbent businesses and enabling faster growth for newer disruptive companies.  Furthermore, secular trends like sustainability offers the opportunity to invest in the future of renewables while also taking part in the massive transition that is underway. Demographic shifts like growing domestic consumption in China presents significant investment opportunities as do economies in transition like India and Japan.  And the potential for increased market volatility or higher interest rates is likely to create attractive investment opportunities across the global credit platform where we have grown to a record AUM of $66 billion, which is more than two times larger than it was less than four years ago.  Now in regard to fundraising, I want to underscore we are communicating and working with our limited partners better than ever before and have raised $40 billion to-date in 2021, an increase of 124% year-to-date over 2020. We will seek to continue this momentum over the next few years and if we are successful, this would provide substantial upside potential to our four year, $130 billion plus fundraising target and drive results beyond our FRE target.  We recently hosted our Annual Global Investor Conference with a 1,000 LPs joining around the world in a hybrid format. It was great to spend time in person with people in New York City and Hong Kong. We are encouraged by the feedback and the headline is this. Investors clearly want the strategies and solutions we have to offer across all three of our global businesses.  Our Global Credit segment\u2019s broad spectrum of credit strategies positions it well to grow as the market continues to shift away from traditional fixed income to private credit. Our Global Investment Solutions segment has the scale, global reach and data to drive portfolio optimization strategies that are more important than ever in a world where private capital has become mainstream in a significant portion of our investors portfolios.  And in Global Private Equity, we are a modern day builder of businesses with more value creation levers than ever before to drive performance, which is critical in a market where competition is fierce and valuations are high. And on top of all of this, we believe we are an industry leader in integrating ESG throughout our firms and our investment processes throughout our value creation processes for the benefit of all stakeholders.  This is all about making everything we touch better including putting us much focus into how we run Carlyle as we do our portfolio companies. Ultimately, we are driving improvements and change across our entire business resulting in better decisions, outcomes and performance for all stakeholders. Curt will now walk you through the financial highlights for the quarter and provide more details on what drove our record results.  So I\u2019ll wrap up with this. The firm is in great shape. We are more global, more diverse, in the midst of a generational evolution at a new Carlyle where our focus is on continuously improving how we drive value and generating attractive returns. We are ahead of schedule on our strategic plan. Our focus on FRE and investment performance is paying off and our platform is benefiting from the growth initiatives to diversify our earnings.  I am proud of our team who are doing a terrific job of executing and delivering on our priorities. I appreciate the hard work, as we accelerate our activity through the balance of this year and into 2022. Thank you. Over to you, Curt. \nCurt Buser : Thanks, Kew, and good morning, everyone. As Kew said, this quarter\u2019s standout performance is a result of a clear focus on executing on our strategic plan. To set the stage, our strong momentum in fundraising, record pace of capital deployment and string of successful realizations are driving a significant increase in the scale of our earnings.  These results are underpinned by attractive investment performance, and are fortifying our balance sheet to help us deliver long-term, sustainable growth in our global platform and fee-related earnings.  Now, let\u2019s dig deeper into our record third quarter earnings. I want to underscore the broad based strength across all components of distributable earnings, fee-related earnings, realized performance revenue and investment income. We delivered record pretax distributable earnings of $731 million this quarter. To put that in perspective, that is more than the entirety of the first half of 2021 and is more than 50% larger than any prior quarter.  Our results are bigger, faster and better than they\u2019ve ever been. Year-to-date, distributable earnings of $1.3 billion outpaces our full year performance in any year since our IPO by nearly 40% and this is without even accounting for what is shaping up to be a strong fourth quarter. On an after tax basis, we generated a record $1.54 in DE per share for the quarter.  Moving on to the components of distributable earnings, let\u2019s start with fee-related earnings, which was $151 million in the quarter and $424 million year-to-date, up 23% compared to 2020 excluding the impact of litigation cost recoveries in the first quarter of last year. We expect management fees and fee-related earnings to move higher next quarter as we activate fees on our latest generation U.S. Real Estate funds and our new U.S. h U.S. Buyout and Growth funds.  Overall, we expect strong FRE growth over the next several years and are on track to hit our 2024 $800 million FRE goal earlier than previously anticipated.  The Global Investment Solutions segment, we doubled year-to-date FRE to $64 million, as strong fundraising and deployment drove a 22% increase in year-to-date management fees with high incremental margin as year-to-date FRE margins expanded to 37%, nearly 13 percentage points higher year-over-year.  Global credit grew fee revenues by $13 million and FRE by $8 million just since last quarter, a 30% sequential increase in FRE driven by strong capital raising and active deployment across the platform including record levels of direct lending origination and record levels of CLO issuance. In Carlyle Aviation, we completed the Fly acquisition, our largest fleet acquisition ever.  Turning to Global Private Equity, we expect FRE to accelerate next quarter and continue to grow throughout 2022 as we benefit from strong fundraising momentum by activating fees later in the fourth quarter on newly raised capital. The positive impact from our capital market strategy is becoming increasingly visible as it further integrates with all our global investment teams.  Net transaction and advisory revenue of almost $60 million year-to-date was nearly double last year and we expect fourth quarter underwriting activity to again drive significant transaction fee generation. Overall, our FRE margin of 33% year-to-date is up about 500 basis points over the past couple of years and is solidly on path towards our 40% target, which we are also likely to reach earlier than previously expected.  Net realized performance revenue of $534 million is far and away our record quarter and was driven by $14 billion in realized proceeds. Importantly, we continue to have $204 billion in remaining fair value across our portfolio, which positions us to generate a high volume of realization activity over the next few years. In the third quarter, we completed private sales across a variety of funds and geographies with realizations of large buyout investments like Novetta and Bountiful and growth strategies like Net Motion and Newport Healthcare, and in continued activity across our U.S. real estate platform.  We also took advantage of strong markets and exceptional investment performance with public secondaries including ZoomInfo, Ortho-Clinical and SBI Card. We have a significant backlog of realizations which close over the next few quarters and we expect to generate at least $450 million in net realized performance revenue over the next two quarters just from already announced sales with potentially significant upside from further realizations from our $19 billion public equity portfolio.  We continue to have confidence in our ability to generate a high level of annual net realized performance revenues over the next several years. Accrued performance revenue remains near a record level at $3.9 billion, down modestly compared to last quarter despite record realizations as our funds continue to perform and appreciate. At this level, the net accrual represents more than $11 per share in future pretax earnings.  We continue to have strong fund performance in a complex environment. Our global private equity portfolio appreciated 5% in the quarter and 31% year-to-date. This quarter we saw the strongest performance in real estate which increased 9% and the natural resources up 7%. Our broad CPE portfolio was up 4%, strong outperformance against the 1.5% decline for the MSCI All Country World Index. Global Investment Solutions had a great quarter once again with 10% appreciation across their portfolio and is now up 39% year-to-date.  This quarter\u2019s strength was led by secondary Main Fund investments and in Global Credit, we continue to thrive providing attractive risk reward across the investment spectrum where our assets under management of $66 million have more than doubled over the past several years.  Realized investment income of $71 million in the third quarter reflects the strong returns and growing size of our on balance sheet investments, which totaled $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Year-to-date, realized investment income of $139 million is nearly triple the same period in 2020. And we are on track to exceed our 2024 target this year.  Our strong earnings have fortified our balance sheet at a great time as we see multiple opportunities to deploy our growing capital base to accelerate our FRE growth by investing in larger funds, seeding new investment strategies, supporting new business activities, and taking advantage of accretive M&A over time.  Given exceptional earnings and our opportunistic debt issuance last quarter, we expect to prepay $250 million in the remaining 2023 bonds in the fourth quarter. This will further improve leverage and boost our financial strength.  To wrap up, we are excited to be delivering on our plan and what that means for our shareholders. We are in fact, outperforming our own expectations, and believe we are well positioned to do so for the next several years. Our strong momentum is allowing us to grow our FRE and our DE and invest in Carlyle\u2019s longer term growth. We are creating exceptional value for shareholders and we continue to deliver on this growth.  And let me turn the call over to the operator, so we can take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your question please. \nGlenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Kew, it\u2019s only been a few quarters, but as you guys addressed the conversation, a lot of your numbers are bumping up on the targets. And here we are in the end of 2021 and they are 2024 target. How do you \u2013 how do we think about \u2013 it\u2019s great that the markets and your performance has gotten there? How do we think about, does that mean that we plateau for a little while or how do you think about the momentum going in and going through these 2024 targets and like 2021, and 2022? \nKewsong Lee: Hey, Glenn, thanks for the question and nice to hear from you. Look, we had a record quarter. We are well ahead of our strategic plan and I really do think this momentum is sustainable because we are seeing great activity, great energy across the entire firm across all of our businesses. We are making a big deal of we are thinking bigger.  Our funds are growing organically where our initiatives in global credit and our new platforms for growth are really taking hold. We are really moving faster, not only our funds \u2013 happening faster but you are seeing the results coming faster. And I think this quarter talks to the results. We are performing better. It\u2019s not only at a corporate level with FRE which has it with FRE, which has accelerated and I think we\u2019ll continue that path.  But all the hard work over the years of putting together these \u2013 our investments, constructing our portfolios and working with our companies to create value it\u2019s really paying off. So, yes, the markets are robust and strong right now. But really the realization activity is a testament to all the hard work that\u2019s gone into the ground to do great investing.  And I think all that performance just continues. So, across the firm, we see great energy, great momentum and quite frankly, very confident that this momentum is sustainable. \nCurt Buser: Hey, Glenn, it\u2019s Curt. And from my perspective, I only guess if I have ever been in a place where I have greater confidence and what I am seeing going forward and that\u2019s really continued sustainable growth. And let me just give you a few points of what I am seeing. So first, right now, we are sitting on $30 billion of AUM that hasn\u2019t activated.  Half to two-thirds of that\u2019s going to turn on in the fourth quarter and that will take our $150 million of FRE that we just talked that our runrate of $600 million higher into 2022. So that\u2019s a great place to be sitting from my place. Second, from a net realized performance revenue standpoint, $3.9 billion of net accrued carry, plus $116 billion of remaining fair value in the ground across our traditional carry funds really supports growth in net realized performance revenue and the sustainability that we have there. And third, you can\u2019t underscore the diversity of the platform. The strength that\u2019s occurred in Global Credit and Investment Solutions really gets a diversified business out and going. And last, I am sitting on a much better balance sheet than we ever had which really gives us the firepower to grow sustainable FRE over time. And so, the place and balancing I look forward, this is a great position right now to be able to have confidence in what we can do going forward. \nGlenn Schorr : Okay. I really appreciate that. Maybe I could squeeze in a follow-up on just, your capital raising has been great. You mentioned about ahead of targets. Can you talk about what you are currently doing in the wealth management channels and what you would like that to be in the future? Thanks. \nKewsong Lee: Sure. So, let me take that, Glenn. So, first, our fundraising, we are on a record pace. So, $40 billion year-to-date, $50 billion over the last 12 months and on that $50 billion, $14 billion in Global Credit, which is really just been clicking every quarter very nicely, very diversified record CLO pace, but not just the CLO, it\u2019s across the platform.  Second, in Investment Solutions \u2013 Global Investment Solutions, $11 billion over the last 12 months. You are seeing the growth in that platform. As you go back in time, I mean, Global Investment Solutions was like a third of what it is today. The growth that we\u2019ve had there is really been significant and then, obviously, $25 billion in global private equity over the last 12 months really serving that business off of further growth.  So, let me be clear in terms of what we are in terms of the retail channel like, our plan is really built on remain focused on our institutional channel. It\u2019s a long-term capital. It\u2019s extremely attractive. It\u2019s driving our top-line growth. If we execute our plan, our FRE is going to grow rapidly over the next few years and we have plans to have that growth thereafter. And today, we largely target retail through our high network channel, through feeder funds. That\u2019s been very successful over time. And that channel is generally been very successful because of our strong brand drives 10% to 15% of our capital raising through those channels. But let\u2019s be clear. Our focus on FRE has really produced results. It\u2019s being growing 20% on a CAGR perspective over the last five years and remains so today. And the fundraising momentum that we have will continue to allow us to grow our FRE and the business. \nGlenn Schorr : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your question please. \nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning and the premiered comments. Just coming back to, maybe capital deployment. It sounds like, you might be gearing up to be a bit more acquisitive and you mentioned things like sustainable and further FRE growth. That sounds to me like maybe some potential permanent capital opportunities. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of where you see the opportunity and then related to Curt\u2019s last commentary that, your 2024 plan is to get into institutional. Might there be an opportunity here to expand the retail, as well. Thank you. \nKewsong Lee: Hey, Bill. It\u2019s Kew. Big picture, we are going to be generating a lot of cash on to our balance sheet over the next several years as our realizations materialize. We are going to take that cash and look for ways to invest in FRE generative businesses. So repurpose that balance sheet capital into sustainable growth businesses that drive FRE. So big picture, that\u2019s what we are looking to do. I want to remind you that none of the targets that we\u2019ve laid out in our strategic plan takes into account for any strategic activity. So, all of that would just be in addition to.  And finally, I think I said this in the past the likely areas are more in the Global Credit areas or in solutions, as opposed to private equity in terms of where we think the opportunities would be. We are thinking about it very globally. And we\u2019ll be in touch when something happens and with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to the second part of the question to Curt. \nCurt Buser: So, on the capital markets piece, Bill, our capital markets business is doing real well, really underpinned by the greater balance sheet capacity we have to support that business. When you see in the transaction revenue about $60 million year-to-date double last year\u2019s number. Two-thirds of that revenue is really coming out of the capital markets business, which is up from almost nothing a year ago. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s causing on growth there. It\u2019s working very nicely and again because of the balance sheet strength allows us to continue to grow. And so, I am very confident in our ability to get that up over $100 million in the next couple of years. \nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. \nAlex Blostein : Great. Good morning. Thanks everybody. I\u2019ll try to squeeze in two-parter and but overlay to the same topic which is fundraising. So, I guess, Kew, big picture for you. Obviously, the flagship fundraising are going incredibly well, but as you look at the business over the next kind of two to three years, what are the strategies that you expect to be kind of fundraising on a more continuous momentum? Just to kind of give us a sense. So this is a new baseline and then we are going to grow off of that baseline. And then, just a numbers clarification question for Curt, can you just give us an update on the final close of the U.S. Buyout Fund? And I think I heard you say, kind of how that\u2019s going to translate into FRE for the fourth quarter, but maybe just give us the pieces like what\u2019s revenue, what\u2019s expenses? Kind of how we think about the contribution from the region raise into the fourth quarter? Thanks. \nCurt Buser: So, let me start and then, Kew will take. So, we will probably handle this a little bit in reverse order as the way you ask it. So, first, as we kind of laid out, our fundraising momentum is fantastic and we are tracking to record levels. And we\u2019ll probably be able to exceed our $130 billion target or deliver upon that earlier than we thought. We are seeing exceptional fundraising in global credit and in global investment solutions and also in private equity as you point out. And we are seeing larger raises. So, we are seeing the credit opportunities fund coming stronger. We are seeing our real estate funds coming stronger. The secondaries business within Investment Solutions coming in stronger. So all of that has led to the doubling of year-to-date fundraising. With respect to specific funds that remain in fundraising, we can\u2019t really comment on those. And so, with respect to U.S. Buyout, et cetera, I can\u2019t really go into detail other than our overall fundraising momentum is good. We will be activating fees here in the fourth quarter. That will have a pick up, but things that remain fundraising, I can\u2019t give you all of those specifics and details. But again, things are looking really well. \nKewsong Lee: Yes. Hey, and Alex, look, just a few high level commentary first. The secular trends towards private markets just continues and after September conference, but also recent road shows with LPs. The interest level and the desire to allocate into alternatives, into private markets continues around the world across all strategies.  Second, LPs are looking to deepen their relationships with their largest and most strategic GPs. That trend positions Carlyle exceptionally well. Third, we are seeing tremendous benefit in cross-selling from one strategy into another with our LPs and as our platform broadens and diversifies, we are seeing more and more opportunity to do that.  Finally, let me just say with respect to credit and in solutions, in credit, there really is a shift happening where flows are moving away from traditional public fixed income securities where yields are virtually zero into private credit solutions. And I think that is a secular trend with real tailwinds that we are going to benefit from.  And in solutions, as I said in my opening remarks, alternatives are not alternative anymore. They are mainstream. It\u2019s a big portion of our LPs portfolios and they need portfolio optimization strategies as it relates to secondary solutions or co-investment strategies to help the deployment and all of that plays to our advantage with our very strong solution segment.  So, I am seeing very good tailwinds and secular forces which are going to be a good momentum for our fundraising continuing. And I just want to say one last thing. You cannot do this without great investment performance. And we\u2019ve got great investment performance. Our portfolios are in great shape. They are well constructed.  Our teams are working very hard. And I suspect when you marry that great performance with the types of trends I just mentioned, it bodes well over the longer term for our fundraising momentum to continue. \nAlex Blostein : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Your question please. \nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I want to go back to comment about how as you realize these gains, the gains in the portfolio, your cash is going to build up on Carlyle\u2019s balance sheet. And historically, Carlyle paid that all out to shareholders. And obviously, you\u2019ve been retaining it all and you pointed to the factor that you want to do acquisitions. I guess, how do you weigh that against the kind of easier and how do you weigh making acquisitions against the easier and more certain path of doing share buybacks and really shrinking your flows? I mean, just my back of the math suggested that, just this quarter is overage versus your dividend would have retired \u2013 would have been and afterwards higher about 2% of your stock and that would be 2% FRE growth with a 100% certainty forever. So, how do you weigh acquiring other people\u2019s companies versus acquiring your own? \nCurt Buser: Chris, it\u2019s Curt. Let me start and thank you for that insightful question. Look, it\u2019s really great in terms of where we are today. The balance sheet is much, much stronger than where it had been before and so, the growth in a very short period of time is really been remarkable, which allows questions like you are asking to really even be on the table.  So, let me start with a few basics of kind of where we are. First, you saw we just increased our authorization to buy back shares. So, on January 1, there will be a $400 million authorization in place to buy back shares to be clear. We are planning to use that to make sure that our dilution does not exceed 1% per year and we will be aggressive where that makes sense in terms of buying back shares.  Second, we are going to \u2013 with this exceptional earnings that we have, I got to pay some taxes. And so, we are going to pay a little bit tax since we are going to pay back some debt. But that\u2019s kind of just clean up and just kind of leaving us really still in a really great financial place. But how we compare, it\u2019s really about driving value for shareholders. And growth is really being rewarded very significantly in the marketplace. So I want to use capital to drive growth, so that we are driving value. And how we do that? Well, by raising larger funds and so that requires more capital off the balance sheet to cover our share to raise larger funds. We are looking at newer strategies.  Initially the stuff that\u2019s aligned with kind of what we are doing, so our capital markets business, the insurance business, all of that needs more capital as well. And so we need to have that to be able to grow. The newer strategies like infrastructure, that while we have \u2013 we think we can really take advantage and grow that much larger, that will require some capital. And then there is M&A opportunities that Kew already spoke about. But in the end, all of this is about driving sustainable FRE growth and I believe that that gets rewarded in the marketplace. \nKewsong Lee: Hey, Chris, it\u2019s a great question. And how we repurpose that cash and invest it to grow strategically to drive FRE and drive growth is absolutely the bigger picture for what we need to do. Obviously, while investing well and running the firm well. Let me just add to what Curt said. It\u2019s all about being incredibly strategic and incredibly thoughtful with these acquisitions and what we are looking to do.  But I\u2019ll just point you to four to two, Carlyle Aviation, our CLO business, Health Invest. These are all examples of really good uses of our balance sheet money to develop businesses which are scaling and growing. So, what are the types of things that we are looking for? Go back to our strategic plan, we\u2019ve been very clear from the beginning.  We are looking for big markets, better scalable that generate recurring and sustainable FRE that we can grow. And that\u2019s my criteria and as our balance sheet gets stronger in a very purposeful, and thoughtful way, we do intend to look for strategic adjacencies that will extend our platform. \nChris Kotowski: Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. \nCurt Buser: Thanks, Chris. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is [Indiscernible] standing in for Mike Cyprys. Just on comp restructuring, we\u2019ve seen some peers make changes to their comp accruals, shifting more comp to carry and reducing the comp that comes from FRE. Just curious on what kind of scenario environment would it make sense for Carlyle to do this? What maybe some challenges or drawbacks from making those total changes? Thank you. \nKewsong Lee: Hey, thanks for your question. Look, we have a really good plan in place. We are comfortable with our plan. We are executing against the plan. The plans resulted in growing FRE and growing earnings. Everything seems to be clicking just right. What else like is, our financial reporting is clear, transparent, easy to understand. We continue to obviously look at different ways to improve the FRE and take advantage of different opportunities. But there is nothing in our plans to do a major comp restructure as you are suggesting. And we would only be interested in one that\u2019s really subsided in nature as opposed to just changing geography on the P&L. So, when and if there is ever something for us to do, we will obviously report that to you, but at the present time, everything that you and I and saying is that\u2019s kind of running pursuant to our existing strategies. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone from Bank of Montreal. Your question please. \nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping if you could touch on asset origination and the opportunities in private credit. I know you already have some established origination channels, but we are seeing some of your peers really double down on this and start to acquire platforms and initiate asset sourcing partnerships. Should we expect to see more of this from Carlyle? And would you go down the acquisition with the partnership groups? Thanks. \nKewsong Lee: Hey, thanks for the question. First, the credit business has been doing really well. The growth there has been significant. We doubled AUM over the past couple of years. The annual rate of growth in AUM is around 20%. If you look at the fundraising very consistent. We are coming off of a really \u2013 a record-setting paces in terms of CLO issuance, demand has been fantastic. But we continue to look really at kind of other areas to continue to build on our platform.  Now, let me be clear, our \u2013 two things that are or a couple of things to be clear. One, taking a platform approach in terms of how we are building the business. Two, very much focused at the present time on investment-grade credits and three, we are looking at cash yield and four, our investors. And generally been successful on all those levels. So, just to remind people, our credit opportunities business has going very well, raising its next fund. It\u2019s in deployment grade. The fund \u2013 the performance there has been very strong. CLO business already talked about aviation, great business, just a very large transaction again performing exceptionally well. Expanding in both infrastructure credit, real estate credit. That provides further opportunities and let\u2019s not forget, the direct lending business which has had a record origination here in the quarter. So, again, platform approach to deliver the results. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Your question please. \nGerald O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Maybe just one on kind of the trajectory of FRE margin from here. You clearly heard the kind of continued focus to build team, the infrastructure, as well as obviously some very strong, I guess, forward-looking fee-related earnings coming online. Can you help us kind of balance the two? And then I would assume some of just the increased spend as we move kind of into those post-pandemic world. But how we should think about the pace between here and as Curt, you mentioned the ahead of schedule as it relates to the 40% target? Thank you. \nCurt Buser: Gerry, thanks. Look, as I said before, we care much more about FRE dollars than FRE margin. And so, we are going to first and foremost chase increase in FRE dollars. Margin is a way to get there. But it\u2019s not the end all by itself and comes down the dollars in the door. So, that\u2019s our number one goal. From a margin perspective, we\u2019ve been growing it very nicely. So, 34% here in the quarter, 33% year-to-date. You can see in the Global Investment Solutions business, already up to 37%. So, lot of things are really coming together nicely. Probably my lowest margin business right now is still in credit. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve been building that platform. That should be our leading piece just as we said at the beginning of the year, that\u2019s going to grow and really drive a lot of FRE margin expansion as we go forward. And so, look, I think we are on track to hit the 40% earlier than 2024. And the exact when we get it? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s going to be sooner than 2024. And we are going to have a nice growth here coming next year for all the reasons that I have already said. And the business is shaping up real nicely. We are focused obviously on cost, but more importantly on growing top-line revenue. \nGerald O'Hara: That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking the questions. \nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Gerry. \nCurt Buser: Thanks, Jerry.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Daniel Harris for any further comments. \nDaniel Harris: Thank you very much for your time today. We know it\u2019s a busy period. We\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you on next quarter\u2019s call and we\u2019ll be at several conferences during the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019ll look forward to, to that as well.  Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to have another opportunity to update you on the great progress we are making against the strategic plan and a record firm-wide earnings performance we delivered this quarter. Our third quarter results are exceptional across all three of our businesses with continued and sustainable progress in FRE, highest production of quarterly distributable earnings ever, and strong fundraising momentum These results build upon a great first half of the year and illustrate the powerful upward long-term growth trajectory our diversified platform can deliver. As an update, let me start with three important points. First, we are ahead of schedule on our strategic plan across all of our businesses. Second, our focus on FRE and investment performance is paying off for all stakeholders.  And finally, one critical factor in this success is that we have built and aligned diverse and experienced leadership who are running our global firm. Thinking bigger, moving faster, and performing better is our mantra. It is helping us deliver on our priorities. Our strategic plan is already leading to strong results right out of the gate and more importantly, we believe it positions us to deliver continued earnings growth and strong investment performance over the long-term.  The second and third quarters were record breakers for us and we see continued growth from here. Just this quarter, we achieved record AUM of $293 billion and year-to-date we invested a record $20 billion and realized a record $29 billion. What we'll describe to you today reflects our progress and we remain laser focused on continuing to execute our longer term goals. We have line of sight into how our strategic plan will generate growth and believe we can continue our momentum to deliver attractive results for our stakeholders.  As we generate an increasing level of retained earnings from strong DE over the next several quarters, we are actively assessing opportunities to invest in our platform to drive more sustainable FRE growth that expands on our strengths. We continue to build the team and infrastructure to ensure we are best positioned to pursue the right growth opportunities for Carlyle.  I am confident that we can grow both organically and through strategic acquisitions to diversify our businesses, build new drivers for future growth and increase our sustainable level of FRE.  Today, as you listen and analyze our results and commentary, please pay close attention to the accelerating activity across all three of our global businesses. We are investing, creating value, returning capital to realizations and fundraising that levels that drive line of sight to accelerating growth and earnings.  In regard to our investing, we see significant growth opportunities ahead. The reason is this, massive changes impacting industries and asset classes around the world in generating exceptional investment opportunities for private markets, which is the backdrop for our record investment pace. And our industry continues to deliver investment outperformance as demonstrated by Carlyle's carry fund appreciation of 33% year-to-date.  Furthermore, we are better competitively positioned than ever before. As a global and diversified investment firm operating at scale, our platform approach enables us to capture opportunities by deploying capital to the sectors and regions of the global economy that are the most attractive. Businesses in these sectors are benefiting from the acceleration of disruptive change and we are capturing these opportunities across all of our investment strategies and investing capital more efficiently.  We are especially focused on trends that are converging, namely in key sectors of the economy like healthcare, where technology continues to generate growth in societal advances. We are also leaning into more traditional power allies like industrials and consumer, but we are bringing a modern approach to incumbent businesses and enabling faster growth for newer disruptive companies.  Furthermore, secular trends like sustainability offers the opportunity to invest in the future of renewables while also taking part in the massive transition that is underway. Demographic shifts like growing domestic consumption in China presents significant investment opportunities as do economies in transition like India and Japan.  And the potential for increased market volatility or higher interest rates is likely to create attractive investment opportunities across the global credit platform where we have grown to a record AUM of $66 billion, which is more than two times larger than it was less than four years ago.  Now in regard to fundraising, I want to underscore we are communicating and working with our limited partners better than ever before and have raised $40 billion to-date in 2021, an increase of 124% year-to-date over 2020. We will seek to continue this momentum over the next few years and if we are successful, this would provide substantial upside potential to our four year, $130 billion plus fundraising target and drive results beyond our FRE target.  We recently hosted our Annual Global Investor Conference with a 1,000 LPs joining around the world in a hybrid format. It was great to spend time in person with people in New York City and Hong Kong. We are encouraged by the feedback and the headline is this. Investors clearly want the strategies and solutions we have to offer across all three of our global businesses.  Our Global Credit segment's broad spectrum of credit strategies positions it well to grow as the market continues to shift away from traditional fixed income to private credit. Our Global Investment Solutions segment has the scale, global reach and data to drive portfolio optimization strategies that are more important than ever in a world where private capital has become mainstream in a significant portion of our investors portfolios.  And in Global Private Equity, we are a modern day builder of businesses with more value creation levers than ever before to drive performance, which is critical in a market where competition is fierce and valuations are high. And on top of all of this, we believe we are an industry leader in integrating ESG throughout our firms and our investment processes throughout our value creation processes for the benefit of all stakeholders.  This is all about making everything we touch better including putting us much focus into how we run Carlyle as we do our portfolio companies. Ultimately, we are driving improvements and change across our entire business resulting in better decisions, outcomes and performance for all stakeholders. Curt will now walk you through the financial highlights for the quarter and provide more details on what drove our record results.  So I'll wrap up with this. The firm is in great shape. We are more global, more diverse, in the midst of a generational evolution at a new Carlyle where our focus is on continuously improving how we drive value and generating attractive returns. We are ahead of schedule on our strategic plan. Our focus on FRE and investment performance is paying off and our platform is benefiting from the growth initiatives to diversify our earnings.  I am proud of our team who are doing a terrific job of executing and delivering on our priorities. I appreciate the hard work, as we accelerate our activity through the balance of this year and into 2022. Thank you. Over to you, Curt. Hey, Glenn, thanks for the question and nice to hear from you. Look, we had a record quarter. We are well ahead of our strategic plan and I really do think this momentum is sustainable because we are seeing great activity, great energy across the entire firm across all of our businesses. We are making a big deal of we are thinking bigger.  Our funds are growing organically where our initiatives in global credit and our new platforms for growth are really taking hold. We are really moving faster, not only our funds \u2013 happening faster but you are seeing the results coming faster. And I think this quarter talks to the results. We are performing better. It's not only at a corporate level with FRE which has it with FRE, which has accelerated and I think we'll continue that path.  But all the hard work over the years of putting together these \u2013 our investments, constructing our portfolios and working with our companies to create value it's really paying off. So, yes, the markets are robust and strong right now. But really the realization activity is a testament to all the hard work that's gone into the ground to do great investing.  And I think all that performance just continues. So, across the firm, we see great energy, great momentum and quite frankly, very confident that this momentum is sustainable. Sure. So, let me take that, Glenn. So, first, our fundraising, we are on a record pace. So, $40 billion year-to-date, $50 billion over the last 12 months and on that $50 billion, $14 billion in Global Credit, which is really just been clicking every quarter very nicely, very diversified record CLO pace, but not just the CLO, it's across the platform.  Second, in Investment Solutions \u2013 Global Investment Solutions, $11 billion over the last 12 months. You are seeing the growth in that platform. As you go back in time, I mean, Global Investment Solutions was like a third of what it is today. The growth that we've had there is really been significant and then, obviously, $25 billion in global private equity over the last 12 months really serving that business off of further growth.  So, let me be clear in terms of what we are in terms of the retail channel like, our plan is really built on remain focused on our institutional channel. It's a long-term capital. It's extremely attractive. It's driving our top-line growth. If we execute our plan, our FRE is going to grow rapidly over the next few years and we have plans to have that growth thereafter. And today, we largely target retail through our high network channel, through feeder funds. That's been very successful over time. And that channel is generally been very successful because of our strong brand drives 10% to 15% of our capital raising through those channels. But let's be clear. Our focus on FRE has really produced results. It's being growing 20% on a CAGR perspective over the last five years and remains so today. And the fundraising momentum that we have will continue to allow us to grow our FRE and the business. Hey, Bill. It's Kew. Big picture, we are going to be generating a lot of cash on to our balance sheet over the next several years as our realizations materialize. We are going to take that cash and look for ways to invest in FRE generative businesses. So repurpose that balance sheet capital into sustainable growth businesses that drive FRE. So big picture, that's what we are looking to do. I want to remind you that none of the targets that we've laid out in our strategic plan takes into account for any strategic activity. So, all of that would just be in addition to.  And finally, I think I said this in the past the likely areas are more in the Global Credit areas or in solutions, as opposed to private equity in terms of where we think the opportunities would be. We are thinking about it very globally. And we'll be in touch when something happens and with that, I'll pass it over to the second part of the question to Curt. Yes. Hey, and Alex, look, just a few high level commentary first. The secular trends towards private markets just continues and after September conference, but also recent road shows with LPs. The interest level and the desire to allocate into alternatives, into private markets continues around the world across all strategies.  Second, LPs are looking to deepen their relationships with their largest and most strategic GPs. That trend positions Carlyle exceptionally well. Third, we are seeing tremendous benefit in cross-selling from one strategy into another with our LPs and as our platform broadens and diversifies, we are seeing more and more opportunity to do that.  Finally, let me just say with respect to credit and in solutions, in credit, there really is a shift happening where flows are moving away from traditional public fixed income securities where yields are virtually zero into private credit solutions. And I think that is a secular trend with real tailwinds that we are going to benefit from.  And in solutions, as I said in my opening remarks, alternatives are not alternative anymore. They are mainstream. It's a big portion of our LPs portfolios and they need portfolio optimization strategies as it relates to secondary solutions or co-investment strategies to help the deployment and all of that plays to our advantage with our very strong solution segment.  So, I am seeing very good tailwinds and secular forces which are going to be a good momentum for our fundraising continuing. And I just want to say one last thing. You cannot do this without great investment performance. And we've got great investment performance. Our portfolios are in great shape. They are well constructed.  Our teams are working very hard. And I suspect when you marry that great performance with the types of trends I just mentioned, it bodes well over the longer term for our fundraising momentum to continue. Hey, Chris, it's a great question. And how we repurpose that cash and invest it to grow strategically to drive FRE and drive growth is absolutely the bigger picture for what we need to do. Obviously, while investing well and running the firm well. Let me just add to what Curt said. It's all about being incredibly strategic and incredibly thoughtful with these acquisitions and what we are looking to do.  But I'll just point you to four to two, Carlyle Aviation, our CLO business, Health Invest. These are all examples of really good uses of our balance sheet money to develop businesses which are scaling and growing. So, what are the types of things that we are looking for? Go back to our strategic plan, we've been very clear from the beginning.  We are looking for big markets, better scalable that generate recurring and sustainable FRE that we can grow. And that's my criteria and as our balance sheet gets stronger in a very purposeful, and thoughtful way, we do intend to look for strategic adjacencies that will extend our platform. Hey, thanks for your question. Look, we have a really good plan in place. We are comfortable with our plan. We are executing against the plan. The plans resulted in growing FRE and growing earnings. Everything seems to be clicking just right. What else like is, our financial reporting is clear, transparent, easy to understand. We continue to obviously look at different ways to improve the FRE and take advantage of different opportunities. But there is nothing in our plans to do a major comp restructure as you are suggesting. And we would only be interested in one that's really subsided in nature as opposed to just changing geography on the P&L. So, when and if there is ever something for us to do, we will obviously report that to you, but at the present time, everything that you and I and saying is that's kind of running pursuant to our existing strategies. Hey, thanks for the question. First, the credit business has been doing really well. The growth there has been significant. We doubled AUM over the past couple of years. The annual rate of growth in AUM is around 20%. If you look at the fundraising very consistent. We are coming off of a really \u2013 a record-setting paces in terms of CLO issuance, demand has been fantastic. But we continue to look really at kind of other areas to continue to build on our platform.  Now, let me be clear, our \u2013 two things that are or a couple of things to be clear. One, taking a platform approach in terms of how we are building the business. Two, very much focused at the present time on investment-grade credits and three, we are looking at cash yield and four, our investors. And generally been successful on all those levels. So, just to remind people, our credit opportunities business has going very well, raising its next fund. It's in deployment grade. The fund \u2013 the performance there has been very strong. CLO business already talked about aviation, great business, just a very large transaction again performing exceptionally well. Expanding in both infrastructure credit, real estate credit. That provides further opportunities and let's not forget, the direct lending business which has had a record origination here in the quarter. So, again, platform approach to deliver the results. Thanks, Gerry."

            "name": "Curt Buser",
            "content": "Thanks, Kew, and good morning, everyone. As Kew said, this quarter's standout performance is a result of a clear focus on executing on our strategic plan. To set the stage, our strong momentum in fundraising, record pace of capital deployment and string of successful realizations are driving a significant increase in the scale of our earnings.  These results are underpinned by attractive investment performance, and are fortifying our balance sheet to help us deliver long-term, sustainable growth in our global platform and fee-related earnings.  Now, let's dig deeper into our record third quarter earnings. I want to underscore the broad based strength across all components of distributable earnings, fee-related earnings, realized performance revenue and investment income. We delivered record pretax distributable earnings of $731 million this quarter. To put that in perspective, that is more than the entirety of the first half of 2021 and is more than 50% larger than any prior quarter.  Our results are bigger, faster and better than they've ever been. Year-to-date, distributable earnings of $1.3 billion outpaces our full year performance in any year since our IPO by nearly 40% and this is without even accounting for what is shaping up to be a strong fourth quarter. On an after tax basis, we generated a record $1.54 in DE per share for the quarter.  Moving on to the components of distributable earnings, let's start with fee-related earnings, which was $151 million in the quarter and $424 million year-to-date, up 23% compared to 2020 excluding the impact of litigation cost recoveries in the first quarter of last year. We expect management fees and fee-related earnings to move higher next quarter as we activate fees on our latest generation U.S. Real Estate funds and our new U.S. h U.S. Buyout and Growth funds.  Overall, we expect strong FRE growth over the next several years and are on track to hit our 2024 $800 million FRE goal earlier than previously anticipated.  The Global Investment Solutions segment, we doubled year-to-date FRE to $64 million, as strong fundraising and deployment drove a 22% increase in year-to-date management fees with high incremental margin as year-to-date FRE margins expanded to 37%, nearly 13 percentage points higher year-over-year.  Global credit grew fee revenues by $13 million and FRE by $8 million just since last quarter, a 30% sequential increase in FRE driven by strong capital raising and active deployment across the platform including record levels of direct lending origination and record levels of CLO issuance. In Carlyle Aviation, we completed the Fly acquisition, our largest fleet acquisition ever.  Turning to Global Private Equity, we expect FRE to accelerate next quarter and continue to grow throughout 2022 as we benefit from strong fundraising momentum by activating fees later in the fourth quarter on newly raised capital. The positive impact from our capital market strategy is becoming increasingly visible as it further integrates with all our global investment teams.  Net transaction and advisory revenue of almost $60 million year-to-date was nearly double last year and we expect fourth quarter underwriting activity to again drive significant transaction fee generation. Overall, our FRE margin of 33% year-to-date is up about 500 basis points over the past couple of years and is solidly on path towards our 40% target, which we are also likely to reach earlier than previously expected.  Net realized performance revenue of $534 million is far and away our record quarter and was driven by $14 billion in realized proceeds. Importantly, we continue to have $204 billion in remaining fair value across our portfolio, which positions us to generate a high volume of realization activity over the next few years. In the third quarter, we completed private sales across a variety of funds and geographies with realizations of large buyout investments like Novetta and Bountiful and growth strategies like Net Motion and Newport Healthcare, and in continued activity across our U.S. real estate platform.  We also took advantage of strong markets and exceptional investment performance with public secondaries including ZoomInfo, Ortho-Clinical and SBI Card. We have a significant backlog of realizations which close over the next few quarters and we expect to generate at least $450 million in net realized performance revenue over the next two quarters just from already announced sales with potentially significant upside from further realizations from our $19 billion public equity portfolio.  We continue to have confidence in our ability to generate a high level of annual net realized performance revenues over the next several years. Accrued performance revenue remains near a record level at $3.9 billion, down modestly compared to last quarter despite record realizations as our funds continue to perform and appreciate. At this level, the net accrual represents more than $11 per share in future pretax earnings.  We continue to have strong fund performance in a complex environment. Our global private equity portfolio appreciated 5% in the quarter and 31% year-to-date. This quarter we saw the strongest performance in real estate which increased 9% and the natural resources up 7%. Our broad CPE portfolio was up 4%, strong outperformance against the 1.5% decline for the MSCI All Country World Index. Global Investment Solutions had a great quarter once again with 10% appreciation across their portfolio and is now up 39% year-to-date.  This quarter's strength was led by secondary Main Fund investments and in Global Credit, we continue to thrive providing attractive risk reward across the investment spectrum where our assets under management of $66 million have more than doubled over the past several years.  Realized investment income of $71 million in the third quarter reflects the strong returns and growing size of our on balance sheet investments, which totaled $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Year-to-date, realized investment income of $139 million is nearly triple the same period in 2020. And we are on track to exceed our 2024 target this year.  Our strong earnings have fortified our balance sheet at a great time as we see multiple opportunities to deploy our growing capital base to accelerate our FRE growth by investing in larger funds, seeding new investment strategies, supporting new business activities, and taking advantage of accretive M&A over time.  Given exceptional earnings and our opportunistic debt issuance last quarter, we expect to prepay $250 million in the remaining 2023 bonds in the fourth quarter. This will further improve leverage and boost our financial strength.  To wrap up, we are excited to be delivering on our plan and what that means for our shareholders. We are in fact, outperforming our own expectations, and believe we are well positioned to do so for the next several years. Our strong momentum is allowing us to grow our FRE and our DE and invest in Carlyle's longer term growth. We are creating exceptional value for shareholders and we continue to deliver on this growth.  And let me turn the call over to the operator, so we can take your questions. Hey, Glenn, it's Curt. And from my perspective, I only guess if I have ever been in a place where I have greater confidence and what I am seeing going forward and that's really continued sustainable growth. And let me just give you a few points of what I am seeing. So first, right now, we are sitting on $30 billion of AUM that hasn't activated.  Half to two-thirds of that's going to turn on in the fourth quarter and that will take our $150 million of FRE that we just talked that our runrate of $600 million higher into 2022. So that's a great place to be sitting from my place. Second, from a net realized performance revenue standpoint, $3.9 billion of net accrued carry, plus $116 billion of remaining fair value in the ground across our traditional carry funds really supports growth in net realized performance revenue and the sustainability that we have there. And third, you can't underscore the diversity of the platform. The strength that's occurred in Global Credit and Investment Solutions really gets a diversified business out and going. And last, I am sitting on a much better balance sheet than we ever had which really gives us the firepower to grow sustainable FRE over time. And so, the place and balancing I look forward, this is a great position right now to be able to have confidence in what we can do going forward. So, on the capital markets piece, Bill, our capital markets business is doing real well, really underpinned by the greater balance sheet capacity we have to support that business. When you see in the transaction revenue about $60 million year-to-date double last year's number. Two-thirds of that revenue is really coming out of the capital markets business, which is up from almost nothing a year ago. So that's really what's causing on growth there. It's working very nicely and again because of the balance sheet strength allows us to continue to grow. And so, I am very confident in our ability to get that up over $100 million in the next couple of years. So, let me start and then, Kew will take. So, we will probably handle this a little bit in reverse order as the way you ask it. So, first, as we kind of laid out, our fundraising momentum is fantastic and we are tracking to record levels. And we'll probably be able to exceed our $130 billion target or deliver upon that earlier than we thought. We are seeing exceptional fundraising in global credit and in global investment solutions and also in private equity as you point out. And we are seeing larger raises. So, we are seeing the credit opportunities fund coming stronger. We are seeing our real estate funds coming stronger. The secondaries business within Investment Solutions coming in stronger. So all of that has led to the doubling of year-to-date fundraising. With respect to specific funds that remain in fundraising, we can't really comment on those. And so, with respect to U.S. Buyout, et cetera, I can't really go into detail other than our overall fundraising momentum is good. We will be activating fees here in the fourth quarter. That will have a pick up, but things that remain fundraising, I can't give you all of those specifics and details. But again, things are looking really well. Chris, it's Curt. Let me start and thank you for that insightful question. Look, it's really great in terms of where we are today. The balance sheet is much, much stronger than where it had been before and so, the growth in a very short period of time is really been remarkable, which allows questions like you are asking to really even be on the table.  So, let me start with a few basics of kind of where we are. First, you saw we just increased our authorization to buy back shares. So, on January 1, there will be a $400 million authorization in place to buy back shares to be clear. We are planning to use that to make sure that our dilution does not exceed 1% per year and we will be aggressive where that makes sense in terms of buying back shares.  Second, we are going to \u2013 with this exceptional earnings that we have, I got to pay some taxes. And so, we are going to pay a little bit tax since we are going to pay back some debt. But that's kind of just clean up and just kind of leaving us really still in a really great financial place. But how we compare, it's really about driving value for shareholders. And growth is really being rewarded very significantly in the marketplace. So I want to use capital to drive growth, so that we are driving value. And how we do that? Well, by raising larger funds and so that requires more capital off the balance sheet to cover our share to raise larger funds. We are looking at newer strategies.  Initially the stuff that's aligned with kind of what we are doing, so our capital markets business, the insurance business, all of that needs more capital as well. And so we need to have that to be able to grow. The newer strategies like infrastructure, that while we have \u2013 we think we can really take advantage and grow that much larger, that will require some capital. And then there is M&A opportunities that Kew already spoke about. But in the end, all of this is about driving sustainable FRE growth and I believe that that gets rewarded in the marketplace. Thanks, Chris. Gerry, thanks. Look, as I said before, we care much more about FRE dollars than FRE margin. And so, we are going to first and foremost chase increase in FRE dollars. Margin is a way to get there. But it's not the end all by itself and comes down the dollars in the door. So, that's our number one goal. From a margin perspective, we've been growing it very nicely. So, 34% here in the quarter, 33% year-to-date. You can see in the Global Investment Solutions business, already up to 37%. So, lot of things are really coming together nicely. Probably my lowest margin business right now is still in credit. That's because we've been building that platform. That should be our leading piece just as we said at the beginning of the year, that's going to grow and really drive a lot of FRE margin expansion as we go forward. And so, look, I think we are on track to hit the 40% earlier than 2024. And the exact when we get it? I don't know. But it's going to be sooner than 2024. And we are going to have a nice growth here coming next year for all the reasons that I have already said. And the business is shaping up real nicely. We are focused obviously on cost, but more importantly on growing top-line revenue. Thanks, Jerry."

Please go ahead.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Whitney. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle\u2019s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. For the second quarter, we generated $143 million in fee-related earnings and $395 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $0.88. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. To ensure participation by all those on the call today, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up and then return to the queue for any additional questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In February, we unveiled a new strategic plan to accelerate growth in earnings over the next 4 years. We laid out the targets, initiatives and changes we are implementing to drive our firm forward. Essential to our objective of performing well for our stakeholders is scale and speed, which is why our senior leadership team is focused on ensuring we\u2019re the best investors we can be and leading the company to operate better and faster than ever before. I am pleased to tell you that we are delivering results that are larger and occurring sooner than previously expected. With our investment platform firing on all cylinders, we are confident in the momentum we are building to drive growth in earnings in the years to come. We have built a talented and diverse leadership team that is executing well. Together, we\u2019ve made meaningful changes that are helping us deliver very attractive and, in some cases, record results as we usher in a new chapter of growth at Carlyle. What our performance this quarter really underscores is that the changes we\u2019ve made are paying off for our stakeholders, which I\u2019d like to summarize with the same framework I outlined at our Investor Day: think bigger, perform better, move faster. Let me start with moving faster as the velocity of virtually all aspects of our business has increased. Deals are being completed on shorter time lines, financings are being executed more quickly, opportunities for exits are presenting themselves sooner, funds are being raised faster than ever before, and accelerating impact from disruptive technology and changes from the pandemic are powering an increased demand for private capital across sectors and regions. The new direction of our organization positions Carlyle well to capture growth from the increased velocity within our industry. For example, we\u2019ve integrated our investing activities to take advantage of our global platform that is built around sector and regional expertise and to make better investment decisions while deploying capital faster. We\u2019ve also reduced or discontinued smaller, less profitable strategies that historically distracted our firm. As a result, our investment organization is operating and connecting more effectively than ever with an ability to pursue buyout, growth and core strategies utilizing a common platform. On the fundraising side, the past year has demonstrated the benefits of adopting a hybrid approach that has helped us raise capital faster and more efficiently. We moved quickly to adapt to virtual LP meetings, diligence sessions and road shows. We now interact with our LPs more regularly, strengthening already deep client relationships. Not only are we able to move faster, but we are focused on scale and thinking bigger. Notably, we are successfully scaling up our largest funds organically. If you look at our latest U.S. opportunistic real estate strategy, we have already closed on nearly $7 billion of capital and expect to hit the hard cap of approximately $8 billion by this fall, at which point the fund would be 45% larger than its prior vintage. Similarly, our recently closed secondaries and co-investment strategies and investment solutions were each approximately 40% to 50% larger than their predecessors. We continue to see healthy demand for our strategies across the global platform. We are also busy building large new businesses in global credit and capital markets. For instance, in just a little over 3 years in opportunistic credit, we built a team from scratch, launched and invested a first-time fund and are well on our way to raising a second fund. Today, this strategy has almost $6 billion of AUM with further growth ahead. Given we are moving faster and thinking bigger, simply put, we are performing better. Our results are improving across the board, as Kurt will detail in a moment. Whether it\u2019s FRE, FRE margin, cherry or investment income, our financial results are attractive and ahead of previous expectations. Importantly, the DE generation from our business in the coming years should provide strong retained earnings, which we intend to invest in growing FRE-generative businesses. Let me give you some additional details on just how well our investment platform is operating. Fundraising has increased nearly 50% year-to-date. We remain confident in the plus of our $130 billion plus target by 2024. This is made possible in large part because our funds are generating attractive returns and our net accrued carry balance is at record levels. Our corporate private equity carry funds are up 28% this year, and we\u2019ve seen strong results across virtually all our investment strategies. This appreciation drove our net accrued carry to a record $4 billion, which we believe is an important indicator of our future earnings power for shareholders. Speaking of which, realizations across our platform continue to accelerate. With a growing pipeline of announced sales amounting to more than $40 billion of total enterprise value, which sets the stage for increasing distributable earnings in the quarters ahead. And finally, our deployment pace has also been robust, more than double the first 6 months of last year as we continue our thesis-based investing in attractive growth areas like technology, health care and e-commerce. We have announced deals equating to almost $50 billion in enterprise value that will close in the next few quarters. Our platform is investing in growth private equity investments like NEOGOV and Trinetx in the United States, and in Europe, and HutchMed in Asia, as well as in large buyout transactions like Medline, the largest deal in more than a decade in our industry. As I said, our platform is really firing on all cylinders and benefiting from a virtuous cycle where strong performance and increased return of capital results in commitments being made to reinvest back into our funds that are organically growing in scale. Let me finish with some comments on the macro and industry conditions more broadly, where trends are providing tailwinds to everything we are doing as a firm. The recovery of the global economy continues with the United States growing at high single-digit rates and both China and Europe currently expanding mid-single digits. With respect to our customers, the largest LPs continue to increase their exposure to private capital as our asset class continues to outperform public indices in this current low-yield environment. By way of example, our own global carry fund portfolio has delivered 900 basis points of outperformance versus public markets since the end of 2019. And importantly, LPs continue to seek fewer, more strategic relationships. For instance, more than 80% of the capital from our largest LPs is now in 4 or more strategies with us. It\u2019s 4x the level it was a decade ago. And as I stated before, our client relationships are deeper and broader than they\u2019ve ever been. Despite these tailwinds, we remain mindful and acutely aware that the pandemic is by no means over around the world. We closely monitor geopolitical, regulatory and policy risks, the threat of inflation and market conditions. So while we have momentum in our business and are confident in the factors we can control, we remain vigilant to avoid complacency. We believe Carlyle is well positioned to navigate the environment, manage risk and capture opportunity. Before handing the call over to Kurt, let me pull this all together and summarize very simply by stating, I\u2019m excited about the momentum we have across our entire organization. We\u2019re delivering great results, and we are ahead of schedule. We know if we invest well and continue to build and operate the firm well, we will accelerate our earnings and generate sustainable growth for our shareholders. Thank you for your time this morning. And now, over to you, Curt.\nCurt Buser: Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks, I will address 3 themes that complement and expand upon Kew\u2019s comments: First, our fee-related earnings growth is accelerating, producing near-term results greater than our prior expectations; second, the spigot for generating larger realized performance income is wide open and is likely to remain so; and finally, we\u2019re focused on converting lower-value performance income and excess capital into higher value and sustainable FRE platform growth. So let\u2019s begin by discussing the accelerating growth in our fee-related earnings. As Kew mentioned, fundraising is ahead of schedule for our largest and most successful funds. Our capital markets activity is strong, and our platforms are well positioned for growth. Over the next year or 2, we expect top line fee growth will drive higher FRE and margins, even with an expected increase in expenses. During the second quarter, we generated $143 million of fee-related earnings. And year-to-date FRE of $272 million increased 20% over 2020, when adjusting for $30 million of expense recovery in Q1 of last year. The FRE increase owes both the top line growth and continued strong focus on expense management. I previously expected 2021 FRE to be at a similar level to 2020 when excluding the expense recovery but now expect the first half of 2021 FRE run rate to be generally sustainable in the back half of the year. While premature to predict 2022, we believe we are set up for even greater FRE growth next year. Our confidence in near-term FRE acceleration is underpinned by fundraising, capital markets activity and platform construction. First, fundraising activity is substantial, not only in real estate but various growth vehicles, buyout funds, CLO formation, credit strategies, and alpha invest [ph] platform activity. The strong first close in our new opportunistic real estate fund is a great example of what we expect across our platform as we close larger successor funds. As a reminder, we recognize fee revenue when a fund starts its investment period, which may not be in the same period of the initial close. Second, we expect long-term fee growth from our capital markets team as it broadens its reach and larger fund strategies come online. Transaction fees net of rebates were $24 million across the firm in the first half of 2021 and increased more than 60% compared to 2020. Our current run rate is about $30 million to $40 million annually just from capital markets activities, and we believe we can at least double this over the next couple of years. And finally, investments we have made in our people and platform allows us to scale with high incremental margins. Over the next few years, we expect significantly higher top line growth while compensation expense should grow at a slower rate. And our progress can be seen in our FRE margin expansion to 34% this quarter, although margins could be subject to volatility over the next several quarters as we continue to scale. Let me now switch to the strong growth opportunity ahead in performance income. We expect a very strong back half of this year. Performance revenues are on pace to achieve our $800 million goal this year, far sooner than 2024. We have line of sight to more than $500 million of incremental net realized performance revenues from already announced exits in Atotech, PPD, Bountiful, Ameos, Novetta and others that are likely to close in the second half of this year. As long as capital markets remain supportive, I foresee us delivering an annual average of $800 million or so in net realized performance revenue for at least the next several years, if not longer. Averaging $800 million annually is about 25% larger than our prior average of just under $650 million in net realized performance revenues that we generated from 2012 to 2017. The remaining value in the ground of our traditional carry fund portfolio is at a record of $116 billion and is almost 90% higher than it was during our last realization cycle. As we highlighted earlier, net accrued carry hit a new record at $4 billion, reflecting a quarterly net increase of more than $800 million. In addition to performance revenues, we generated $68 million of realized investment income in the first half of 2021, almost 80% more compared to the first 6 months in 2020. Over the past decade, we have methodically invested into our funds and strategies and today have $1.9 billion in balance sheet investments that we believe will support a sustainably higher level of investment income. The last topic I want to discuss is how to flesh out further what Kew alluded to in his earlier comments, namely, how we think about converting lower-value performance earnings into higher valued fee earnings. There are several areas we are focused on. First, raising and co-investing into larger funds. Our balance sheet will continue to co-invest as we scale our funds. And while those investments should drive higher investment income over time, larger fund sizes will help drive substantially higher FRE in the near term. Two, seeding new products. We\u2019re also seeding and launching scalable new strategies, like real estate credit, infrastructure credit, and renewables, amongst others. And as these areas also attract outside capital, that will drive higher top line growth and over time increasing levels of fee-related earnings. Third, providing capital to underwrite a growing capital markets business. We\u2019ve already seen a significant uptick in revenues. And with various transactions on the horizon and a capital markets group increasingly integrated with our deal teams, we expect to see a sustainably higher level of revenues going forward, and of course, providing capital for M&A. We\u2019ve largely been focused on growing our business organically, which we believe produces the highest return on investment capital for our shareholders, but we also see opportunities to inorganically and accretively build our business, like we\u2019ve done with Aviation and Fortitude in the recent past, and our focus will be on building new capabilities with a high degree of fee earnings. During the second quarter, we also saw an opportunity to raise $500 million in junior subordinated debt with a 4-year term at attractive rates. We\u2019ll use this capital to help with what I just discussed and it positions us with near-term firepower to continue to grow our platform. In sum, we\u2019re right on track to grow our fee earnings and our distributable earnings while also investing in longer-term growth. Our portfolio is performing well and early feedback on fundraising is positive. Our firm and people are firing on all cylinders, and we are excited about what we can deliver for our shareholders over the next few years. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.\nKen Worthington: Maybe let\u2019s start on fundraising. You set a target of $130 billion at Analyst Day, and the press is suggesting good investor feedback on your funds in the market. And both Kew and Curt, you both highlighted how things are doing much, much better, more funds reaching their hard caps or expected to meet their hard caps versus just their targets. Yet your expectations are $130 billion plus. So maybe help us out what might be the upper end of your comfort zone assuming that this constructive environment would persist? Is $130 billion-plus, could that be 150? Is it 160? Like how high might that be if everything were to go perfectly and you were to hit the hard caps on the majority of the funds that you expect to be in the market over the next few years?\nKewsong Lee: Ken, it\u2019s Kew. Thanks for your question. Look, let\u2019s focus on the plus of the $130 billion-plus. And things are just going great right now. As you pointed out, market conditions are strong. And we very much are ahead of schedule. We\u2019re seeing real success in driving organic growth in our biggest and best established funds. Now look, not all funds are going to keep growing at the 40% to 50% rate that we\u2019ve been seeing more recently. But having said that, it\u2019s about our performance, it\u2019s about the LPs\u2019 view of us as a consistent trustworthy partner over time, it\u2019s about our ability to deploy well, and it\u2019s about our ability to return that capital back to them. And so this is a multiyear campaign. We\u2019ve got several years to go, but we\u2019re really confident based on the reception that we\u2019ve seen thus far in the market with respect to the plus of that target that you pointed out. And then finally, I\u2019d say, look, the trends we\u2019re seeing with our LPs, the fact that the cross-selling opportunities just continue to increase, the fact that the fundraising cycle for us is happening fast, in other words, velocity of fundraising is higher, all of this bodes well, and I\u2019m really proud and excited for our team. But it\u2019s early days. We have several more years to go. But suffice it to say, the initial feedback is positive, and we very much are focused on the plus of the $130 billion-plus target we laid out for you.\nKen Worthington: Okay. I tried to put you on a number, but at least it was worth the try. And then, Kew, you suggested things are happening faster; fundraising, investing and harvesting all happening faster. How much of the life cycle of a fund is compressed? Like what is the life cycle of a fund now versus what it might have been in the last cycle? And is this compression purely cyclical and really just a function of a great environment? Or is there something more secular here? And if it is more secular -- ultimately the dividend is still $0.25. If things are feeling so much better and feel like they\u2019re sustaining themselves, why not increase that $0.25?\nKewsong Lee: Okay. Let me tackle the first part of your question first. And I guess the answer in a pithy way is yes to all the factors you laid out. Clearly, there are cyclical reasons why things are happening great right now because of the current environment that we\u2019re in. But there are also some secular and structural things happening in our industry. Let\u2019s start first with just the change of -- the changes that are happening because of COVID and because of technology disruption, the fact that entrepreneurs just want to stay private for longer, The fact that all types of companies, whether they\u2019re growth disruptors or large incumbents, are approaching private capital to partner with us because we can help them make their companies better and we can help them accelerate their growth, all of this longer-term bodes well for the fact that our opportunity set in private equity continues to grow. Second, yes, the speed is accelerating. There are changes to how deals get done these days because of the hybrid environment. I personally think some of those will stick post -- and I want to be careful in terms of even saying post-pandemic, but when we get through the worst of this, I do believe you\u2019re going to see some of those changes stick because it\u2019s just more efficient the way processes are handled these days. And finally, I think, we as a firm, because we\u2019re better connected, because of the big investments we\u2019ve made to build out teams, deep sector expertise, we just have conviction and can move faster. We have domain expertise. We have huge platform resources. We bring it to bear on deals, and it enables us to move quicker while still having great investment judgment on opportunities. Now finally, you marry that with the fact that when we raise our funds, typically, we, as a rule of thumb, have thought about investing a fund across, let\u2019s say, a 4, maybe 5-year time horizon, but that clearly has sped up. Because of the opportunity set increasing, because of the demand for private capital increasing, 5 has become 4, in some instances 3 years, maybe even sooner in certain high-velocity asset classes like credit. So the time line to deploy a fund has in fact increased. But look, none of this matters if you don\u2019t perform well. We\u2019re focused on being the best investing firm we can be. If we can drive great returns over the long term, the fundraising will continue to be easy. So let me just stop there. With respect to your dividend comment, let me ask Curt to comment on that.\nCurt Buser: So Ken, on dividends just, as you\u2019ll recall, what we\u2019ve consistently said is we look at dividends, first and foremost, to make sure that\u2019s fixed and sustainable. I don\u2019t want fluctuations and definitely do not want it going down. Do want it to grow over time. And what we\u2019ve said there is we\u2019re looking to grow in fee-related earnings and looking at that in arrears on an after-tax basis. And we all know, we\u2019re reading the press, we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll probably see some increases in taxes. You\u2019ve see an increase in our own tax rate. And so we\u2019re looking at all that on an after-tax basis. But look, I\u2019m feeling really comfortable about our FRE growth. I\u2019m feeling really good about the $800 million. And we\u2019ll be assessing that in due course, but pursuant to the guidelines that I just laid out.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: I was hoping you could spend a couple of minutes on your capital priorities. Obviously, Carlyle is going to be generating a lot of cash flows over the next couple of years as you enter the sort of super cycle for performance fees. Can you help us frame how this will be used? What are the areas of inorganic opportunities you might be looking at? And if you were to use some of this cash to see additional products at Carlyle, what are some of the areas of new investments you\u2019re looking to deploy that capital?\nKewsong Lee: Great. Thanks, Alex. Let me start on this one. So really just taking off on what I just said in the prepared remarks, you\u2019re absolutely right that we\u2019re going to be accumulating a fair amount of cash over the next few years, and particularly as we grow FRE and the carry gains that we see really embedded and as well as the balance sheet investments come through. We\u2019ve been focused on growing organically, which we believe is the highest return on invested capital for our shareholders, and we see plenty of opportunity for doing that. And quite frankly, the forecasts that we gave at Investor Day was really predicated on that organic growth. And so what are we going to do here in the near term? Well, first, we\u2019re going to do just what I said, is we\u2019re going to invest into our larger funds. Second, we\u2019re going to see new products, things like real estate credit, things like infrastructure credit, things like infrastructure, more broadly, renewables. There\u2019s plenty of space in terms of new products for us to continue to seed and invest and drive growth. We\u2019re also -- our capital markets business, look, it\u2019s a natural adjacency. We see real growth there, but you have to also have the balance sheet capital to support those activities. You ought to know this most of all given where you\u2019re from. So that\u2019s one of the areas we\u2019re focused on. And then last, obviously, we\u2019ll take a look at M&A. Prices are high right now. And so that\u2019s why we also like organic growth. But just as Kew has outlined before, we want things that are going to make a difference. We want things that will help us grow, particularly in our credit business where we think that scale also helps. And look, we\u2019ve not lost sight of insurance and other things that we\u2019re looking at, but we want to make sure that things fit in right and can give us the right ability to scale the firm.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Maybe a very high-class problem to have. But if you look at all the performance revenues, 80%, 90% continues to get produced by private equity because that\u2019s where the big base is. So curious if you even think about it that way in terms of balancing out the firm over time? And maybe, while we\u2019re on that topic, we could just touch on where you think you\u2019re at in the credit build-out by product distribution people. However, you want to slice it. I appreciate it.\nKewsong Lee: So Glenn, let me take a shot. So look, we\u2019ve laid out our priorities really well in terms of growing earnings, focused on FRE, focused on improving margins, don\u2019t obviously want to be the lowest cost provider. We want to be able to invest well. We think that that will deliver higher distributable earnings. But in terms of balance sheet, I want to be balance sheet right. And not all AUM is necessarily equally profitable. So the way we really think about our growth is how to drive earnings, first and foremost. And then what we\u2019re also looking at is with the things that we have coming on, we think we can get very nice top line growth. With respect to credit, there\u2019s a lot of growth that\u2019s already occurred. So credit, if you look at really the numbers from an AUM perspective, as of June 30, we\u2019re up about 22% in AUM over last year in the credit business, going from, call it, $50 billion to $61 billion in total AUM. In addition, there\u2019s very good top line growth, about 10% year-to-date over the prior year. Now what\u2019s confusing some of those numbers, which you are probably also seeing, is the FRE margin hasn\u2019t picked up the way I think it will pick up. And this is a business that we think we\u2019re going to double here in the next couple of years. What\u2019s really happening now in terms of some of what you\u2019re seeing on comparison, remember, in the first 6 months of last year, we had the Fulton transaction, generated a lot of transaction fees as well as some cost recoveries first half of last year, obviously not recurring in this quarter now. Second thing is you have a little bit of a drag from energy business and the distressed business. The energy business, you all know, is winding down, and this is not the right time to roll from a distressed play. And so we have a little bit of pressure there. But the growth in our direct lending business, the CLO business is really performing exceptionally strong. Aviation is doubling. I mean things are really happening and really doing very well, and I\u2019m really proud of that team, and I think that we\u2019re going to see some very nice growth going forward.\nDaniel Harris: And then, Glenn, this is Dan. As it relates to the accrual, on your question on concentration, look, just by the way these products have been put together, you\u2019re going to see most of the performance revenues emanating from our global private equity platform. Credit is much more of a fee business. And then what I would say is if you look at Solutions, from just a couple of years ago where we had virtually 0 net accrual, that\u2019s up to about $250 million-plus. And within Global Private Equity, we have good diversity across the U.S., Asia, Europe, real estate. And so we think about it more broadly. Even though we report within Global Private Equity a single segment, there\u2019s a whole lot of strategies in there that make up that accrual. So it is diversified. You will always see the majority of the net performance fees from Global Private Equity, but keep an eye on Solutions as well as that continues to grow.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: I want to ask about the Capital Markets business. I appreciate, the outlook looks like it\u2019s very strong, on track to meet or exceed the financial contribution objectives. Just wondering in the semi-early days, if there were any qualitative takeaways from how that business is going. Obviously, the backdrop is strong. Any evolution in terms of how you see the purpose of it and the size and function 3 to 5 years out for Carlyle?\nKewsong Lee: Adam, thanks for the question. So first, we did some work here to really kind of refocus, energize the group, and it\u2019s really playing out well. The business thus far is, well, I\u2019ll say, ahead of plan. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in our activity as well as the transaction fees that we\u2019ve been seeing. We\u2019re already at a run rate of about $30 million to $40 million in net fees out of just the capital markets part of the business. And I can see that growing very rapidly and being a double that in the next couple of years, if not sooner. And one of the things that we\u2019ve really focused on is making sure that we have the balance sheet capacity to support that growth. And what\u2019s really nice about what\u2019s happened is the team is engaging across the entire platform. So much more integrated across everything we do, both in credit as well as within the various private equity functions. And so our ability to capture the appropriate opportunities out of our existing deal flow is fantastic. And then, look, for the time being, we\u2019re focused on our own business and our own deal flow before going out and doing things elsewhere. But we\u2019ve not lost sight of that opportunity as well. So I do think early days; very good on where we\u2019re headed.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Daniel Harris.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for listening on what I know is a very busy day. Should you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to Investor Relations at any time. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In February, we unveiled a new strategic plan to accelerate growth in earnings over the next 4 years. We laid out the targets, initiatives and changes we are implementing to drive our firm forward. Essential to our objective of performing well for our stakeholders is scale and speed, which is why our senior leadership team is focused on ensuring we're the best investors we can be and leading the company to operate better and faster than ever before. I am pleased to tell you that we are delivering results that are larger and occurring sooner than previously expected. With our investment platform firing on all cylinders, we are confident in the momentum we are building to drive growth in earnings in the years to come. We have built a talented and diverse leadership team that is executing well. Together, we've made meaningful changes that are helping us deliver very attractive and, in some cases, record results as we usher in a new chapter of growth at Carlyle. What our performance this quarter really underscores is that the changes we've made are paying off for our stakeholders, which I'd like to summarize with the same framework I outlined at our Investor Day: think bigger, perform better, move faster. Let me start with moving faster as the velocity of virtually all aspects of our business has increased. Deals are being completed on shorter time lines, financings are being executed more quickly, opportunities for exits are presenting themselves sooner, funds are being raised faster than ever before, and accelerating impact from disruptive technology and changes from the pandemic are powering an increased demand for private capital across sectors and regions. The new direction of our organization positions Carlyle well to capture growth from the increased velocity within our industry. For example, we've integrated our investing activities to take advantage of our global platform that is built around sector and regional expertise and to make better investment decisions while deploying capital faster. We've also reduced or discontinued smaller, less profitable strategies that historically distracted our firm. As a result, our investment organization is operating and connecting more effectively than ever with an ability to pursue buyout, growth and core strategies utilizing a common platform. On the fundraising side, the past year has demonstrated the benefits of adopting a hybrid approach that has helped us raise capital faster and more efficiently. We moved quickly to adapt to virtual LP meetings, diligence sessions and road shows. We now interact with our LPs more regularly, strengthening already deep client relationships. Not only are we able to move faster, but we are focused on scale and thinking bigger. Notably, we are successfully scaling up our largest funds organically. If you look at our latest U.S. opportunistic real estate strategy, we have already closed on nearly $7 billion of capital and expect to hit the hard cap of approximately $8 billion by this fall, at which point the fund would be 45% larger than its prior vintage. Similarly, our recently closed secondaries and co-investment strategies and investment solutions were each approximately 40% to 50% larger than their predecessors. We continue to see healthy demand for our strategies across the global platform. We are also busy building large new businesses in global credit and capital markets. For instance, in just a little over 3 years in opportunistic credit, we built a team from scratch, launched and invested a first-time fund and are well on our way to raising a second fund. Today, this strategy has almost $6 billion of AUM with further growth ahead. Given we are moving faster and thinking bigger, simply put, we are performing better. Our results are improving across the board, as Kurt will detail in a moment. Whether it's FRE, FRE margin, cherry or investment income, our financial results are attractive and ahead of previous expectations. Importantly, the DE generation from our business in the coming years should provide strong retained earnings, which we intend to invest in growing FRE-generative businesses. Let me give you some additional details on just how well our investment platform is operating. Fundraising has increased nearly 50% year-to-date. We remain confident in the plus of our $130 billion plus target by 2024. This is made possible in large part because our funds are generating attractive returns and our net accrued carry balance is at record levels. Our corporate private equity carry funds are up 28% this year, and we've seen strong results across virtually all our investment strategies. This appreciation drove our net accrued carry to a record $4 billion, which we believe is an important indicator of our future earnings power for shareholders. Speaking of which, realizations across our platform continue to accelerate. With a growing pipeline of announced sales amounting to more than $40 billion of total enterprise value, which sets the stage for increasing distributable earnings in the quarters ahead. And finally, our deployment pace has also been robust, more than double the first 6 months of last year as we continue our thesis-based investing in attractive growth areas like technology, health care and e-commerce. We have announced deals equating to almost $50 billion in enterprise value that will close in the next few quarters. Our platform is investing in growth private equity investments like NEOGOV and Trinetx in the United States, and in Europe, and HutchMed in Asia, as well as in large buyout transactions like Medline, the largest deal in more than a decade in our industry. As I said, our platform is really firing on all cylinders and benefiting from a virtuous cycle where strong performance and increased return of capital results in commitments being made to reinvest back into our funds that are organically growing in scale. Let me finish with some comments on the macro and industry conditions more broadly, where trends are providing tailwinds to everything we are doing as a firm. The recovery of the global economy continues with the United States growing at high single-digit rates and both China and Europe currently expanding mid-single digits. With respect to our customers, the largest LPs continue to increase their exposure to private capital as our asset class continues to outperform public indices in this current low-yield environment. By way of example, our own global carry fund portfolio has delivered 900 basis points of outperformance versus public markets since the end of 2019. And importantly, LPs continue to seek fewer, more strategic relationships. For instance, more than 80% of the capital from our largest LPs is now in 4 or more strategies with us. It's 4x the level it was a decade ago. And as I stated before, our client relationships are deeper and broader than they've ever been. Despite these tailwinds, we remain mindful and acutely aware that the pandemic is by no means over around the world. We closely monitor geopolitical, regulatory and policy risks, the threat of inflation and market conditions. So while we have momentum in our business and are confident in the factors we can control, we remain vigilant to avoid complacency. We believe Carlyle is well positioned to navigate the environment, manage risk and capture opportunity. Before handing the call over to Kurt, let me pull this all together and summarize very simply by stating, I'm excited about the momentum we have across our entire organization. We're delivering great results, and we are ahead of schedule. We know if we invest well and continue to build and operate the firm well, we will accelerate our earnings and generate sustainable growth for our shareholders. Thank you for your time this morning. And now, over to you, Curt. Ken, it's Kew. Thanks for your question. Look, let's focus on the plus of the $130 billion-plus. And things are just going great right now. As you pointed out, market conditions are strong. And we very much are ahead of schedule. We're seeing real success in driving organic growth in our biggest and best established funds. Now look, not all funds are going to keep growing at the 40% to 50% rate that we've been seeing more recently. But having said that, it's about our performance, it's about the LPs' view of us as a consistent trustworthy partner over time, it's about our ability to deploy well, and it's about our ability to return that capital back to them. And so this is a multiyear campaign. We've got several years to go, but we're really confident based on the reception that we've seen thus far in the market with respect to the plus of that target that you pointed out. And then finally, I'd say, look, the trends we're seeing with our LPs, the fact that the cross-selling opportunities just continue to increase, the fact that the fundraising cycle for us is happening fast, in other words, velocity of fundraising is higher, all of this bodes well, and I'm really proud and excited for our team. But it's early days. We have several more years to go. But suffice it to say, the initial feedback is positive, and we very much are focused on the plus of the $130 billion-plus target we laid out for you. Okay. Let me tackle the first part of your question first. And I guess the answer in a pithy way is yes to all the factors you laid out. Clearly, there are cyclical reasons why things are happening great right now because of the current environment that we're in. But there are also some secular and structural things happening in our industry. Let's start first with just the change of -- the changes that are happening because of COVID and because of technology disruption, the fact that entrepreneurs just want to stay private for longer, The fact that all types of companies, whether they're growth disruptors or large incumbents, are approaching private capital to partner with us because we can help them make their companies better and we can help them accelerate their growth, all of this longer-term bodes well for the fact that our opportunity set in private equity continues to grow. Second, yes, the speed is accelerating. There are changes to how deals get done these days because of the hybrid environment. I personally think some of those will stick post -- and I want to be careful in terms of even saying post-pandemic, but when we get through the worst of this, I do believe you're going to see some of those changes stick because it's just more efficient the way processes are handled these days. And finally, I think, we as a firm, because we're better connected, because of the big investments we've made to build out teams, deep sector expertise, we just have conviction and can move faster. We have domain expertise. We have huge platform resources. We bring it to bear on deals, and it enables us to move quicker while still having great investment judgment on opportunities. Now finally, you marry that with the fact that when we raise our funds, typically, we, as a rule of thumb, have thought about investing a fund across, let's say, a 4, maybe 5-year time horizon, but that clearly has sped up. Because of the opportunity set increasing, because of the demand for private capital increasing, 5 has become 4, in some instances 3 years, maybe even sooner in certain high-velocity asset classes like credit. So the time line to deploy a fund has in fact increased. But look, none of this matters if you don't perform well. We're focused on being the best investing firm we can be. If we can drive great returns over the long term, the fundraising will continue to be easy. So let me just stop there. With respect to your dividend comment, let me ask Curt to comment on that. Great. Thanks, Alex. Let me start on this one. So really just taking off on what I just said in the prepared remarks, you're absolutely right that we're going to be accumulating a fair amount of cash over the next few years, and particularly as we grow FRE and the carry gains that we see really embedded and as well as the balance sheet investments come through. We've been focused on growing organically, which we believe is the highest return on invested capital for our shareholders, and we see plenty of opportunity for doing that. And quite frankly, the forecasts that we gave at Investor Day was really predicated on that organic growth. And so what are we going to do here in the near term? Well, first, we're going to do just what I said, is we're going to invest into our larger funds. Second, we're going to see new products, things like real estate credit, things like infrastructure credit, things like infrastructure, more broadly, renewables. There's plenty of space in terms of new products for us to continue to seed and invest and drive growth. We're also -- our capital markets business, look, it's a natural adjacency. We see real growth there, but you have to also have the balance sheet capital to support those activities. You ought to know this most of all given where you're from. So that's one of the areas we're focused on. And then last, obviously, we'll take a look at M&A. Prices are high right now. And so that's why we also like organic growth. But just as Kew has outlined before, we want things that are going to make a difference. We want things that will help us grow, particularly in our credit business where we think that scale also helps. And look, we've not lost sight of insurance and other things that we're looking at, but we want to make sure that things fit in right and can give us the right ability to scale the firm. So Glenn, let me take a shot. So look, we've laid out our priorities really well in terms of growing earnings, focused on FRE, focused on improving margins, don't obviously want to be the lowest cost provider. We want to be able to invest well. We think that that will deliver higher distributable earnings. But in terms of balance sheet, I want to be balance sheet right. And not all AUM is necessarily equally profitable. So the way we really think about our growth is how to drive earnings, first and foremost. And then what we're also looking at is with the things that we have coming on, we think we can get very nice top line growth. With respect to credit, there's a lot of growth that's already occurred. So credit, if you look at really the numbers from an AUM perspective, as of June 30, we're up about 22% in AUM over last year in the credit business, going from, call it, $50 billion to $61 billion in total AUM. In addition, there's very good top line growth, about 10% year-to-date over the prior year. Now what's confusing some of those numbers, which you are probably also seeing, is the FRE margin hasn't picked up the way I think it will pick up. And this is a business that we think we're going to double here in the next couple of years. What's really happening now in terms of some of what you're seeing on comparison, remember, in the first 6 months of last year, we had the Fulton transaction, generated a lot of transaction fees as well as some cost recoveries first half of last year, obviously not recurring in this quarter now. Second thing is you have a little bit of a drag from energy business and the distressed business. The energy business, you all know, is winding down, and this is not the right time to roll from a distressed play. And so we have a little bit of pressure there. But the growth in our direct lending business, the CLO business is really performing exceptionally strong. Aviation is doubling. I mean things are really happening and really doing very well, and I'm really proud of that team, and I think that we're going to see some very nice growth going forward. Adam, thanks for the question. So first, we did some work here to really kind of refocus, energize the group, and it's really playing out well. The business thus far is, well, I'll say, ahead of plan. We're seeing nice growth in our activity as well as the transaction fees that we've been seeing. We're already at a run rate of about $30 million to $40 million in net fees out of just the capital markets part of the business. And I can see that growing very rapidly and being a double that in the next couple of years, if not sooner. And one of the things that we've really focused on is making sure that we have the balance sheet capacity to support that growth. And what's really nice about what's happened is the team is engaging across the entire platform. So much more integrated across everything we do, both in credit as well as within the various private equity functions. And so our ability to capture the appropriate opportunities out of our existing deal flow is fantastic. And then, look, for the time being, we're focused on our own business and our own deal flow before going out and doing things elsewhere. But we've not lost sight of that opportunity as well. So I do think early days; very good on where we're headed."

            "name": "Curt Buser",
            "content": "Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks, I will address 3 themes that complement and expand upon Kew's comments: First, our fee-related earnings growth is accelerating, producing near-term results greater than our prior expectations; second, the spigot for generating larger realized performance income is wide open and is likely to remain so; and finally, we're focused on converting lower-value performance income and excess capital into higher value and sustainable FRE platform growth. So let's begin by discussing the accelerating growth in our fee-related earnings. As Kew mentioned, fundraising is ahead of schedule for our largest and most successful funds. Our capital markets activity is strong, and our platforms are well positioned for growth. Over the next year or 2, we expect top line fee growth will drive higher FRE and margins, even with an expected increase in expenses. During the second quarter, we generated $143 million of fee-related earnings. And year-to-date FRE of $272 million increased 20% over 2020, when adjusting for $30 million of expense recovery in Q1 of last year. The FRE increase owes both the top line growth and continued strong focus on expense management. I previously expected 2021 FRE to be at a similar level to 2020 when excluding the expense recovery but now expect the first half of 2021 FRE run rate to be generally sustainable in the back half of the year. While premature to predict 2022, we believe we are set up for even greater FRE growth next year. Our confidence in near-term FRE acceleration is underpinned by fundraising, capital markets activity and platform construction. First, fundraising activity is substantial, not only in real estate but various growth vehicles, buyout funds, CLO formation, credit strategies, and alpha invest [ph] platform activity. The strong first close in our new opportunistic real estate fund is a great example of what we expect across our platform as we close larger successor funds. As a reminder, we recognize fee revenue when a fund starts its investment period, which may not be in the same period of the initial close. Second, we expect long-term fee growth from our capital markets team as it broadens its reach and larger fund strategies come online. Transaction fees net of rebates were $24 million across the firm in the first half of 2021 and increased more than 60% compared to 2020. Our current run rate is about $30 million to $40 million annually just from capital markets activities, and we believe we can at least double this over the next couple of years. And finally, investments we have made in our people and platform allows us to scale with high incremental margins. Over the next few years, we expect significantly higher top line growth while compensation expense should grow at a slower rate. And our progress can be seen in our FRE margin expansion to 34% this quarter, although margins could be subject to volatility over the next several quarters as we continue to scale. Let me now switch to the strong growth opportunity ahead in performance income. We expect a very strong back half of this year. Performance revenues are on pace to achieve our $800 million goal this year, far sooner than 2024. We have line of sight to more than $500 million of incremental net realized performance revenues from already announced exits in Atotech, PPD, Bountiful, Ameos, Novetta and others that are likely to close in the second half of this year. As long as capital markets remain supportive, I foresee us delivering an annual average of $800 million or so in net realized performance revenue for at least the next several years, if not longer. Averaging $800 million annually is about 25% larger than our prior average of just under $650 million in net realized performance revenues that we generated from 2012 to 2017. The remaining value in the ground of our traditional carry fund portfolio is at a record of $116 billion and is almost 90% higher than it was during our last realization cycle. As we highlighted earlier, net accrued carry hit a new record at $4 billion, reflecting a quarterly net increase of more than $800 million. In addition to performance revenues, we generated $68 million of realized investment income in the first half of 2021, almost 80% more compared to the first 6 months in 2020. Over the past decade, we have methodically invested into our funds and strategies and today have $1.9 billion in balance sheet investments that we believe will support a sustainably higher level of investment income. The last topic I want to discuss is how to flesh out further what Kew alluded to in his earlier comments, namely, how we think about converting lower-value performance earnings into higher valued fee earnings. There are several areas we are focused on. First, raising and co-investing into larger funds. Our balance sheet will continue to co-invest as we scale our funds. And while those investments should drive higher investment income over time, larger fund sizes will help drive substantially higher FRE in the near term. Two, seeding new products. We're also seeding and launching scalable new strategies, like real estate credit, infrastructure credit, and renewables, amongst others. And as these areas also attract outside capital, that will drive higher top line growth and over time increasing levels of fee-related earnings. Third, providing capital to underwrite a growing capital markets business. We've already seen a significant uptick in revenues. And with various transactions on the horizon and a capital markets group increasingly integrated with our deal teams, we expect to see a sustainably higher level of revenues going forward, and of course, providing capital for M&A. We've largely been focused on growing our business organically, which we believe produces the highest return on investment capital for our shareholders, but we also see opportunities to inorganically and accretively build our business, like we've done with Aviation and Fortitude in the recent past, and our focus will be on building new capabilities with a high degree of fee earnings. During the second quarter, we also saw an opportunity to raise $500 million in junior subordinated debt with a 4-year term at attractive rates. We'll use this capital to help with what I just discussed and it positions us with near-term firepower to continue to grow our platform. In sum, we're right on track to grow our fee earnings and our distributable earnings while also investing in longer-term growth. Our portfolio is performing well and early feedback on fundraising is positive. Our firm and people are firing on all cylinders, and we are excited about what we can deliver for our shareholders over the next few years. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. So Ken, on dividends just, as you'll recall, what we've consistently said is we look at dividends, first and foremost, to make sure that's fixed and sustainable. I don't want fluctuations and definitely do not want it going down. Do want it to grow over time. And what we've said there is we're looking to grow in fee-related earnings and looking at that in arrears on an after-tax basis. And we all know, we're reading the press, we're seeing what's going on, we'll probably see some increases in taxes. You've see an increase in our own tax rate. And so we're looking at all that on an after-tax basis. But look, I'm feeling really comfortable about our FRE growth. I'm feeling really good about the $800 million. And we'll be assessing that in due course, but pursuant to the guidelines that I just laid out."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Daniel Harris. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Mary. Good morning and welcome to Carlyle's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. For the first quarter, we generated $129 million in fee-related earnings and $215 million in distributable earnings with DE per common share of $0.58. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. [Operator Instructions] With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We hope you're all doing well and that you and your families are safe and healthy. Our strong results this quarter highlight that we are making good progress against the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day in February. We are encouraged by our early results and are committed to sharing transparently our progress. Our plan is focused on accelerating the scope and scale of our investment platforms, expanding our efforts in adjacencies like insurance and capital markets and institutionalizing the firm to drive higher incremental margins. Over the next four years, as we execute this plan, we expect to raise $130 billion or more in new capital; generate at least $800 million in annual fee-related earnings; produce at least $800 million a year in net realized performance revenue; and ultimately, deliver $1.6 billion or more in annual distributable earnings for shareholders, all by 2024. We had a strong first quarter, and I am confident in our ability to achieve or exceed the goals we have set for ourselves. Today, I'd like to highlight three areas of progress. First, our investment platform is firing on all cylinders; second, our strong performance is translating into accelerating near-term results and setting the stage for growth; and finally, we continue to improve how we operate as a firm to drive sustainable and improving performance for all stakeholders. Let me start with our investment platform. On performance, simply put, our funds delivered their best quarter in the past decade. Many of our largest and most significant funds appreciated materially in the quarter. Our Corporate Private Equity carry funds appreciated 15% in the quarter, and our Investment Solutions carry funds appreciated 14%. And with Global Credit and Natural Resources carry funds each delivering 7% to 8% appreciation in the quarter; we saw strength across our entire global investment platform. On new investments. Deployment activity and our deal pipeline are as robust as they have ever been. Our global platform is in incredible advantage in sourcing deals, creating value at our portfolio companies and helping us navigate a rapidly changing environment. We invested $5.5 billion of new capital in our carry funds this quarter and nearly $21 billion over the last 12 months. We saw significant regional activity in Europe, further ramp-up in private equity growth opportunities in Asia and the United States and strong activity across the tech, healthcare and consumer sectors. With respect to exits. We generated more than $6 billion in realized proceeds for our LPs this quarter, completing full sales of portfolio companies such as PA Consulting in Europe, PIB in the United States and WingArc 1st in Japan. We took both Atotech and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics public in the quarter, increasing our public portfolio to more than $20 billion. And from that portfolio, we sold $1 billion in shares. Most importantly, our pipeline for future realizations continues to build with the maturation and seasoning of our portfolios. Finally on fundraising. We raised nearly $8 billion in new capital in the first quarter, with Investment Solutions and Global Credit driving a majority of that activity. Early feedback is positive on several flagship global private equity funds that are returning to market, and we expect to have first closings in several of these funds over the next few quarters. It's fair to say that our strong investment performance and elevated level of investment activity positively impacts our fundraising efforts. This brings me to the second point that success in these major business activities is generating strong financial results and positions us well to produce material increase in future distributable earnings. The strong start to our fundraising campaign increases our confidence that as we raise capital as laid out in our plan, you'll see a commensurate increase in management fees, fee-related earnings and margins. In the first quarter, we generated $129 million in fee-related earnings, which is an increase of 30% from an as-adjusted basis last year. We continue our focus on driving FRE, and growth in FRE should really gain steam as we activate fees on large new fund closings over the course of the next several years. But the real big news in this quarter is our record net accrued carry balance of $3.2 billion, an increase of 2.5 times from a year ago. This record level of accrued carry, alongside our strong investment performance, positions us to see acceleration in net performance revenues over the course of this year and beyond as our exit pace picks up. Our momentum and continued focus on fee-related earnings and our better visibility on accelerating realization activity from the growth in accrued carry all underpin our confidence in materially growing distributable earnings as we execute against our strategic plan objectives. Finally, my third point is on the continuous changes and investments we are making at Carlyle to evolve and further institutionalize the firm to sustain improved performance. We have challenged our 1,800 people to think bigger, perform better and move faster. We are running the firm more effectively, scaling everywhere possible and streamlining where prudent. We are focused on continuing to attract, grow and retain the very best talent across our entire global organization and have no doubt that our results will drive meaningful value creation for shareholders. In closing, we feel great about our strategy, performance in improving how we operate the firm. We are building on our solid momentum to accelerate growth and create lasting impact. We are excited, confident and optimistic for what's ahead. Over to you, Curt.\nCurtis Buser: Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks, I will address three areas to support and build upon Kew's opening comments. First, I'll provide additional context around the strong first quarter carry fund appreciation and our record accrued carry balance. Second, I will quickly review our first quarter results, and finally, leave you with some considerations looking forward. So let's begin with the higher portfolio valuations. Our investment portfolios are generally in great shape, concentrated in high-quality assets, diversified by sector and vintage and managed by highly experienced investment teams. Continued improvements in operating performance at the individual portfolio company level and increasing public and private market valuation levels were tailwinds to valuation this quarter. Add in greater economic certainty alongside historically low interest rates, and our funds benefited from significant fair value increases in the quarter. With the past few quarters' strong appreciation, our most recent fully invested flagship buyout funds are all at the upper end of relative performance as compared to their predecessors, and the investing generation of these funds is also tracking favorably. We believe this position these strategies very well upon their return to the market. This appreciation resulted in a significant increase in our net accrued carry balance, which we already noted rose to $3.2 billion, up 36% from $2.3 billion just last quarter. The size of the accrual has accelerated, and its composition has diversified. We currently have five funds that have more than $100 million in net accrued carry. Carlyle Partners VI remains early in its cash generation cycle and have a net accrued carry balance of nearly $1.4 billion. And we have not yet realized any carry from our latest fully invested Asia and Europe buyout funds, though both funds are performing very well and are also now in accrued carry. Notably, three significant carry funds posted very strong appreciation and moved into carry this quarter, including our fourth generation Europe Buyout and Europe Technology funds, each of which appreciated more than 25%, and our currently investing seventh U.S. buyout fund, which appreciated 10%. Keep in mind, however, that our seventh U.S. buyout fund and our fourth Europe Technology fund remain in their investment periods and could move in and out of accrued carry as they fully invest their capital. Let me now move to a review of our first quarter results. We generated $215 million in distributable earnings and DE per share of $0.58 for the quarter, an increase of 21% over a year ago. The growth has driven - was driven by a $30 million or 30% increase in fee-related earnings to $129 million when adjusting for the $30 million in legal recoveries a year ago. Our FRE margin this quarter of 31% was up about 600 basis points from an as-adjusted 25% a year ago. Positively impacting FRE this quarter was a higher level of transaction fees, which had $15 million in the quarter and $36 million over the past six months, illustrates the strong traction Carlyle Global Capital Markets is already experiencing as we focus on growing this earnings adjacency. We're excited about this growth adjacency and believe we have significant room to continue to expand, as outlined at our Investor Day. Net realized performance revenues of $76 million for the quarter increased significantly compared to last year, but on a longer-term view, remain low by our historic standards. We expect to see both the pace of exits and performance revenues associated with those exits increase significantly. Realized investment income was $30 million and was higher than any quarter in 2020. With investments on our balance sheet now at $1.8 billion on a projected healthy exit pace, investment income should remain higher than in prior periods. Fundraising was also strong out of the gate, $7.8 billion of new capital raised this quarter. Similar to last year, activity was driven mostly by Global Credit and Investment Solutions. Our fundraising mix should shift more toward Global Private Equity later this year as several GPE funds are expected to have first closings. In the first quarter, we took advantage of a strong CLO market to issue four new CLOs, three in the U.S. and one in Europe. And in April, AlpInvest held a final close on its latest co-investment fund at $3.5 billion, more than twice as large as its predecessor fund. Fees on this program will begin with second quarter results. Finally, let me cover a few items to look out for over the next few quarters. First, we expect significant distributable earnings growth as our exit pace increases across our platform. For example, we have already announced exits for Ithaca, MedRisk and PPD in Carlyle Partners VI and Ameos in Carlyle Europe Partners III, all of which should close over the next few quarters. G&A expense continues to benefit from lower travel and conference expenditures as well as lower professional fees. So we expect G&A will increase throughout 2021 as activity normalizes but is likely to remain below prior peak levels. Equity-based compensation expense of $35 million was up versus $32 million a year ago and reflects the impact of February strategic equity grants. Equity-based compensation expense will modestly increase next quarter to reflect a full quarter of expense amortization on these awards and will likely remain at those levels for the near to medium term. Our effective DE tax rate, which was approximately 5% for the first quarter, reflects the ongoing utilization of existing tax operating loss carryforwards, but we continue to expect our full year effective DE tax rate to wind up closer to a mid-teen blended rate. We maintained our dividend at $0.25 per share for the quarter and expected to remain at this level for the balance of the year. Over time, we would expect our fixed dividend to grow with FRE beginning as early as next year. We are committed to maintaining a balance sheet-light approach and have ample resources to accomplish our organic growth objectives. And with the persistence of a low-rate environment, we continue to assess opportunities to optimize our capital structure and lower our average cost of capital. And finally, subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of Metropolitan Real Estate for a small gain and subleased its previous office space in New York, which will result in a GAAP charge in the second quarter for the loss on the sublease. Both the sale of MRE and the sublease will modestly improve our FRE margins prospectively. In sum, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the exceptional performance of our funds. We remain on track to meet or exceed our 2024 goals to grow our pre-tax distributable earnings to at least $1.6 billion with an attractive mix of sustainable fee-related earnings and strong performance from our funds and investments. We'll continue to keep you updated on our progress. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much, appreciated. Maybe if we could just talk a little bit about Global Credit build. You mentioned you got four CLOs off in the quarter as the market opened, which is great. Maybe if we could talk about what to expect over the next coming quarters, maybe for direct lending, opportunistic credit, aviation, infrastructure credit, that would be great.\nKewsong Lee: It's Kew. I hope you're doing well. Look, big picture, progress in Global Credit continues on track, and we're quite pleased with how things are going in. Right now, we've got about $60 billion of AUM. Just to remind you, it was at about $50 billion last year at this time, so about a 20% growth. As you pointed out, our CLO business is really doing well. It has priced a bunch of things in Europe and in the U.S., as Curt pointed out. We feel really good about that franchise. I just wanted to point out that the most important thing, that is - it's performing well. Its default rate and the performance for its investors is top notch. In terms of direct lending, we are looking for opportunities to continue to expand that platform. I think our BDC is performing quite well and our track record is such that we believe we are well positioned to continue raising money into that strategy. Opportunistic credit is just doing great. Not only is the track record thus far living to our expectations, but more importantly, delivering for LPs. But they are in the markets, so I want to be careful. The reception continues to be quite strong, and we're confident in our ability to continue driving to build out that whole platform. The one area that I would say is tougher in this environment is distressed credit. Obviously, with all the liquidity that's in the market, a rising tide lifts all boats, and I would say distressed credit is a little bit harder to see where we're going to find significant opportunities for ramp-up and deployment in the current conditions that we're seeing. And then finally, you mentioned aviation, so I'll give you a little bit of color on that platform. We're really pleased. The funds are performing well. The most recent SASOF fund just closed on a very large transaction, which I'm sure you read about. The portfolio quality is - through the most disruptive period of time you could have imagined in the travel business, in the aviation business, has performed, in our view, very, very well. And our LPs are quite happy with what they're doing. And so that's - that seeds the - that sets the stage for continued growth in that platform. So all in all, I think big picture, I just gave you a color - a bit of color across our platform, but big picture, we're feeling very good about our Credit platform and our ambitions to continue doubling that business as I laid out for you in our strategic plan. And Glenn, just to add on just a little bit with some numbers. Global Credit raised $3.2 billion in new capital this quarter, almost $12 billion over the last 12 months. That really drives that business. Now one of the things you'll see here in the first quarter, those four new CLOs, they haven't been on in terms of management fees for the whole quarter. So you got to keep that into account. And then the other thing that Kew pointed out on distressed credit, we did have one carry fund in there that had a step-down. And so that is a part of what you're seeing there. And then keep in mind that a lot of our Global Capital Markets transaction fees, which we're feeling really good about, come through that segment. And Q4 was a blowout for that piece in terms of at least looking at it historically from a Carlyle perspective. Q1 was also strong but a little bit of a step-down. So very pleased with the trajectory in Global Credit.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt.\nPatrick Davitt: Good morning, everyone. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect to maintain a balance sheet-light approach, which, in my mind, doesn't really jive with your shift to reinvesting most cash flow back into the business and having some book value compounding. So could you kind of address what appears to be a little bit of a conflict with what you said on the call and the new cash distribution policy?\nKewsong Lee: Let me start. Maybe Curt will have a little bit of color to add at the end as well. Look, we are pursuing an asset-light model. We are an investment firm, and we believe if we can achieve our strategic plan, we're going to grow very nicely and drive high return on capital for our shareholders. Now that doesn't mean we're not going to use our balance sheet appropriately to grow. And you've seen what we've done with Fortitude, you've seen what we've done with the aviation platform, and yes, we do anchor all of our fundraising with significant investments from the balance sheet for purposes of alignment. So the way I would phrase it is while everyone is talking about asset-light, I believe we are an asset-right type of approach, which is focus as an investment firm, drive high growth and high return on capital and strategically use our balance sheet in the right way, that's my asset-right categorization, in the right way to step function our growth in the future.\nCurtis Buser: And the only thing I'll add to that, Patrick, is we have ample resources to be able to fund our organic plan. And we're looking at, just as we talked about on our Investor Day, opportunities in an opportunistic manner. And we'll continue to review our capital structure in terms of what we think is best at the right time to take advantage of the market and to continue to really drive a growth trajectory for all stakeholders in the firm.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. I hope you are doing well. So my question is on compensation. Several of your peers run with models that accrue compensation against performance fees where they shifted more toward performance fees relative to management fees. So I'm just thinking, what is your thought on reallocating compensation out of FRE, which could improve the CG stock valuation while also incentivizing employees more through performance?\nCurtis Buser: Craig thanks. Let me start and then maybe Kew will add in. What we have really done is really try to grow fee-related earnings and distributable earnings the old-fashioned way by earning it one step at a time, growing the business, doing the things right. And we're not trying to hide the ball in terms of our true compensation. So all of our base and bonus is clearly spelled out, and that's all within fee related earnings. And within our performance revenues, there is a portion of that, generally, it's 45% is shared with the deal teams and with people. And so that's the basic compensation model that's not been tweaked. Obviously, we grant equity awards on top of that. But it's right down the center of the fairway kind of approach, earning it as we go. We'll continue to look at ways to incentivize our people in different ways, but right now, we're feeling pretty good about our overall plans in terms of how to attract and retain key talent\nKewsong Lee: Yes, Craig, I would just say, at a higher level, we're just going to be very transparent and very direct about these types of issues. We really feel solid we feel great about our alignment. And accounting is accounting, but we're not going to use accounting to in lieu of substance. And so our investment professionals, they receive cash compensation. If the performance of their funds is strong, they will benefit with carry. That's in complete alignment with our limited partners and our shareholders who get a good share of that as we perform. And then, of course, finally, we have broader distribution of stock in the hands of those leaders that can really help drive performance on behalf of the whole enterprise. And we feel good about overall how we've compensated our professionals and how we've aligned them appropriately. Could we find different ways to optimize and better align as our objectives shift and as our plan evolves? Of course. And that's what we will always be looking to do. But as Curt lay out, we are very comfortable with the transparent and the clear and, quite frankly, the right down the middle of the fairway way that we've laid out compensation for all of you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Patrick's question. With Carlyle entering the next fundraising cycle, how does seeding of this next vintage of flagship funds look? I think the founders were big investors in the earlier funds and might not participate to the same extent in the next generation of funds. So how much would Carlyle have to contribute in terms of incremental capital to the next round of fundraising? And to what extent is these commitments really generated from the investment gains in the prior funds versus what is sort of the new incremental investment dollars that you think you'll need to contribute?\nCurtis Buser: It's Curt. Thanks for your question, very astute. One of the things that I've always been really proud of Carlyle is just the level of commitment of all of our investment professionals as well as really all of the employee base to invest in our products. So we eat what we sell. So huge alignment in terms of being invested in it. In fact, it's clearly, the majority of the capital that goes into our funds really comes out of those after-tax dollars from our people. And guess what, that's highly diversified. And so we're not dependent upon any single person, and the balance sheet is obviously there to fund it. So as I look forward, the real issue is we're going from $100 billion to $110 billion before to $130 billion plus, and it's the incremental on that, which is really what's key, and I'm comfortable that our strategies are appropriate to be able to fund all of that.\nOperator: Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDean Stephan: Hey, good morning. This is Dean Stephan on for Mike Carrier. Just given the fundraising guidance at Investor Day and some first close is expected later this year, just wondering if we could get some color around the fundraising pipeline for the remainder of '21, maybe the potential size of successor funds and what percentage of current vintages have been invested or deployed thus far.\nKewsong Lee: Sure. Dean, it's Kew. Look, obviously, it's hard for me to talk specifically about anything in light of the rules and regs with respect to fundraising. So let me just put it this way and don't let the brevity of my answer don't read anything into that. Look, we feel really good about our fundraising and our fundraising prospects. Early reception has been quite positive. Our performance from our investment platform, as we lay out, is quite strong, and that provides a good backdrop for all of our fundraising discussions. The numbers that we posted this quarter, as Curt pointed out, are mostly from our Investment Solutions in our Credit business. And so our very large flagship products in GPE have formally announced and are in market as we speak. So hence, I'm going to be careful. We feel very good about our prospects. And there is one other thing that I'd like to point out. Over the past year, across our broad platform, right now, I'd say about 70% or more of our LPs have committed to more than three funds at Carlyle. That's up from about 60% at the end of 2020. So we're seeing broad positive reception. The environment is strong for fundraising. Our performance is very good. And let me just leave it at that and tell you we're pretty confident about our fundraising prospects.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGerry O'Hara: Thanks and good morning. Kew, perhaps you could give us a little bit of an update on your strategy with respect to kind of streamlining fund structures. I think you've touched on it in recent history as well as in some of your prepared remarks. But if you could perhaps give us a few specific examples or perhaps how we should think about that going forward, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Sure. I appreciate the question. Look, as I laid out in our strategic plan, we are focused on building and scaling our strongest and our best platforms. And if we can do that, big will become bigger, but we will benefit from operating leverage. And you saw an example of that in this quarter when Curt announced the final closing of the sale of MRE out of our Investment Solutions business. Great franchise but not in keeping with our strategic plan principles of focusing on our biggest and best and scaling the biggest and best even more. So for example, in the past, you've seen us stop investing out of or move or sell fund complexes or fund products, I meant to say, that are, in our opinion, subscale and not really going to be moving the needle for us in a big way with respect to what our strategic ambitions are. In Asia, we've done this with certain growth product, in the Middle East, in Mexico, and there are numerous examples throughout our Global Private Equity franchise and in our Credit franchise where we've made the tough decisions but the strategically important decisions to say these are not part of our strategic plan. And now you've seen a platform with our redesign, focused on Global Private Equity, Global Credit and Investment Solutions, which we've streamlined and where our best strategies and teams are the ones that we are going to really support, grow and scale. And that really sets the foundation for the first big leg of our strategic plan, which is accelerating the growth of our best and strongest investment platforms. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color of how focused I am on this principle and how we continue to drive and build Carlyle around this moving forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Question I wanted to circle back on credit. I was hoping we could dive in a little bit more on the performance of the different credit strategies. I see in the presentation deck, you mentioned the 8% carry fund appreciation for the quarter, but I was hoping you might be able to elaborate on the performance of some of the other credit strategies, and particularly the ones you're looking to build out, including CLOs, direct lending and some of the real asset credit strategies. How was the performance in those strategies during the quarter? And how does that compare versus key benchmarks and against how they did last year as well? Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: So a great question. And why don't I suggest we do this. I'll start, and between Curt and me, we will give you a pretty good sense. So I'll start with our CLO business, and you've specifically asked about performance. So our long-term default rate since 1999 is 1%, which is less than 1/3 of the LSTA index, which stands at 3.3%. So clearly, great performance relative to that index. And our net implied loss rate at the moment is 40 basis points versus the index at 1.2%. So we're one of the biggest investors in the CLO market in large part because our performance is great. And we're recognized for that, which is why we've been, I believe, so busy and why this platform will continue to grow. Go ahead, Curt.\nCurtis Buser: So look, I think just as I said before, Mike, the fundraising has been really strong, and that's really in this business, you have to perform in order to fund raise. The CLOs have done really well. Despite some of our concerns a year ago, but the team has really kind of done all the way down, which is manage default rates. And then in a lot of our other products like we talked about aviation before, but if you really talk about some of the retail products that we have as well as in direct lending, those are performing very well. And the new dollars that are coming in continue to track, not to mention things like infrastructure credit, and we're even starting to put together some things and other asset-backed lending areas. So more to come around some of that in terms of building out not just aviation and infrastructure but in other places as well. So all of that is really being put together by fund by actual performance. I need to be a little careful, Mike, in terms of how specific I can be because the BDC has not yet reported and I don't want to front run our own BDC from a public perspective.\nMichael Cyprys: Got it. Any color maybe on last year, where it has been reported just in terms of what the private credit direct lending performance had been and also on the real estate credit, the infrastructure credit? Just all these strategies you're looking to build out, just hoping to get a little bit more granularities on the performance on those.\nCurtis Buser: I don't have all that at my fingertips, Mike. So maybe we can do something at a subsequent point in time.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty of UBS. Your line is now open.\nAdam Beatty: Good morning. I want to ask about Investment Solutions. In the context of fundraising, your release mentioned the closing of some separate accounts. And we tend to think in terms of discrete funds where the fundraising and solutions has also been quite strong. But I wanted to get your comment on the potential for separate accounts to kind of provide drip, drip in the background, if you will, of fundraising for Solutions? And also, if I could squeeze it in, maybe the outlook for realizations, just in the context of the legacy agreement with AlpInvest.\nKewsong Lee: All right. Let me appreciate the question. Look, SMA is an important part of our business, specifically it relates to Solutions. We raised, I think, a little over $2 billion just in SMAs with respect to AlpInvest. And that's part of the success we've been having in that business. Over time, we expect to see larger and larger co-mingled funds. But this is an asset class that is growing, and we have real interest from very large LPs who would like to structure unique programs with us. And of course, to the extent we can do that in an economically attractive way and something that makes sense for our business, we will engage in those types of discussions. But more broadly speaking, SMAs, as it relates to Solutions but also in the Credit business is something that we've been having real success in. And we carefully are growing that to ensure that we're doing that in a way which is building the business but is doing it in an economically accretive way.\nCurtis Buser: Just picking up on the comment around distribution pace for investment solutions. So again, a lot of that, we're dealing with primary fund of funds, secondary co-invest. And so it's really kind of as you see the overall markets returning, they're then getting that cash. Now one thing I want to point out to you is on page 10 of our release, you'll see that the net accrued performance revenue with respect to Solutions has gone from $110 million net a year ago to $191 million. And so that's very good improvement from the net accrued carry. And more and more, as we these new programs, a much larger percentage, 40%, comes to Carlyle as that's realized. Keep in mind, these are European style waterfalls, so it takes a while for that to flush through and come to us. So I would not expect a huge increase in the immediate future, but I do think that the amount of carry that Investment Solutions contributes to the firm will be more meaningful, especially next year and the year thereafter than it has been in the recent past. But look, Global Private Equity will continue to be the lion's share of our realized carry.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now open.\nRobert Lee: Thank you so much and thanks to take my question I guess and I apologize I got on the call late, so if you may have covered this earlier. But clearly, accrued carry continues to kind of ramp pretty substantially [Indiscernible] from realizations. But is there any change or update in terms of how you're thinking about the pace of realizations? The market is being pretty buoyant. I mean, I know we're kind of expecting to scale into 2022 and beyond. But any sense that it maybe could come on faster than you felt it even a quarter or two ago? And then well, that's my question.\nKewsong Lee: It's Kew. Look, the environment right now is very robust in the capital markets. And when you marry that with the fact that we've been working really hard on the investment platform side, investing, working with our portfolio companies and our funds that we think have been constructed well, those portfolios are maturing and they're seasoning. And so to the extent that we can take advantage of these capital market conditions, you should expect that we will be doing that. And that is why I made the comment that the pipeline of realizations continues to grow and we intend to be active. Now look, my crystal ball isn't perfect with respect to capital market conditions in the future. And so I just want to point out that a big part of the appreciation and our views on realizations are dependent in large part on making sure dependent in large part on the environment being healthy. And to the extent that, that is the case, we do expect to see a meaningful ramp-up in exit activity, which should drive strong distributable earnings for the balance of the year and beyond.\nCurtis Buser: And just adding on that, Robert. I mean, I think we gave very clear color that we expect increases in both distributable earnings and really being driven off of our expected realization activity. And the pipeline that I called out in my prepared remarks, Ameos and Europe Partners III, Ithaca, PPD and MedRisk and Carlyle Partners VI, those are deals that are already announced and they're in funds that are taking cash carry. So you can just kind of see, obviously, that there are clear pathways to very good realization activity in the near term.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.\nChris Kotowski: Good morning. Thank you. On Investor Day, you highlighted kind of strategies for or a drive to kind of add to the core strategies. And I wonder if you could update us on that because I guess the like your core-plus real estate fund is a 2016 vintage fund. Should we be expecting kind of a more permanent vehicle that's always raising capital quarter in quarter out? And I'm also curious, just is the investor base for those core strategies different than the periodic private equity funds?\nCurtis Buser: So let me maybe start. Just our core-plus real estate platform is doing really well, growing very good. And that is one that's just ever opened. So that's not one that we need to reduce. So it's a core-plus strategy. It's evergreen. And the trajectory here has been fantastic in terms of raise, and Rob Stuckey and the team have done a really nice job of how they've invested that. And so we're very optimistic with respect to that. In our private equity space, that's where it is more, as you pointed out, traditional from a - you need to reload, but those are longer-duration investment periods and longer-life funds. And so look, at least in terms of my preparation, when you start getting up in 10-to-20-year time periods that gets the feel very kind of permanent. And look, even our regular funds that generally have a six-year investment period and then take another five or six years thereafter to fully realize, they're very sticky. And 90% of that 98% of that is really very sticky capital. Management fee is coming from that. So it's the business from a permanence perspective, I think, feels really good. I don't know, Kew, if there is anything you want to add to that.\nKewsong Lee: Chris, the only thing I would add is - I thought where you're going with your question is in terms of adjacencies above and beyond our core businesses. Curt did point out the success we're having in vehicles like CPI, which is our core-plus real estate fund. But also our Global Capital Markets business, only six months in, we feel really good about. We've established a globally coordinated team. We know what we're trying to do in terms of risk, and we're executing at a revenue run rate right now which is beating our expectations, quite frankly. So we've got we feel really good about momentum there. And obviously, we haven't talked about it on this call, but everything we're doing at Fortitude and in the insurance space continue to be exciting for us. We're very busy. Fortitude, the platform is performing very well. And I believe it's just a matter of time before we see growth in that platform, which then comes back to benefit Carlyle and our investment management activities. So it's a fulsome answer for you, Chris, but we feel pretty good about what's happening above and beyond the first major leg of our plan, which is our core investment platform.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Daniel Harris, you may continue.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to Investor Relations at any time. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We hope you're all doing well and that you and your families are safe and healthy. Our strong results this quarter highlight that we are making good progress against the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day in February. We are encouraged by our early results and are committed to sharing transparently our progress. Our plan is focused on accelerating the scope and scale of our investment platforms, expanding our efforts in adjacencies like insurance and capital markets and institutionalizing the firm to drive higher incremental margins. Over the next four years, as we execute this plan, we expect to raise $130 billion or more in new capital; generate at least $800 million in annual fee-related earnings; produce at least $800 million a year in net realized performance revenue; and ultimately, deliver $1.6 billion or more in annual distributable earnings for shareholders, all by 2024. We had a strong first quarter, and I am confident in our ability to achieve or exceed the goals we have set for ourselves. Today, I'd like to highlight three areas of progress. First, our investment platform is firing on all cylinders; second, our strong performance is translating into accelerating near-term results and setting the stage for growth; and finally, we continue to improve how we operate as a firm to drive sustainable and improving performance for all stakeholders. Let me start with our investment platform. On performance, simply put, our funds delivered their best quarter in the past decade. Many of our largest and most significant funds appreciated materially in the quarter. Our Corporate Private Equity carry funds appreciated 15% in the quarter, and our Investment Solutions carry funds appreciated 14%. And with Global Credit and Natural Resources carry funds each delivering 7% to 8% appreciation in the quarter; we saw strength across our entire global investment platform. On new investments. Deployment activity and our deal pipeline are as robust as they have ever been. Our global platform is in incredible advantage in sourcing deals, creating value at our portfolio companies and helping us navigate a rapidly changing environment. We invested $5.5 billion of new capital in our carry funds this quarter and nearly $21 billion over the last 12 months. We saw significant regional activity in Europe, further ramp-up in private equity growth opportunities in Asia and the United States and strong activity across the tech, healthcare and consumer sectors. With respect to exits. We generated more than $6 billion in realized proceeds for our LPs this quarter, completing full sales of portfolio companies such as PA Consulting in Europe, PIB in the United States and WingArc 1st in Japan. We took both Atotech and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics public in the quarter, increasing our public portfolio to more than $20 billion. And from that portfolio, we sold $1 billion in shares. Most importantly, our pipeline for future realizations continues to build with the maturation and seasoning of our portfolios. Finally on fundraising. We raised nearly $8 billion in new capital in the first quarter, with Investment Solutions and Global Credit driving a majority of that activity. Early feedback is positive on several flagship global private equity funds that are returning to market, and we expect to have first closings in several of these funds over the next few quarters. It's fair to say that our strong investment performance and elevated level of investment activity positively impacts our fundraising efforts. This brings me to the second point that success in these major business activities is generating strong financial results and positions us well to produce material increase in future distributable earnings. The strong start to our fundraising campaign increases our confidence that as we raise capital as laid out in our plan, you'll see a commensurate increase in management fees, fee-related earnings and margins. In the first quarter, we generated $129 million in fee-related earnings, which is an increase of 30% from an as-adjusted basis last year. We continue our focus on driving FRE, and growth in FRE should really gain steam as we activate fees on large new fund closings over the course of the next several years. But the real big news in this quarter is our record net accrued carry balance of $3.2 billion, an increase of 2.5 times from a year ago. This record level of accrued carry, alongside our strong investment performance, positions us to see acceleration in net performance revenues over the course of this year and beyond as our exit pace picks up. Our momentum and continued focus on fee-related earnings and our better visibility on accelerating realization activity from the growth in accrued carry all underpin our confidence in materially growing distributable earnings as we execute against our strategic plan objectives. Finally, my third point is on the continuous changes and investments we are making at Carlyle to evolve and further institutionalize the firm to sustain improved performance. We have challenged our 1,800 people to think bigger, perform better and move faster. We are running the firm more effectively, scaling everywhere possible and streamlining where prudent. We are focused on continuing to attract, grow and retain the very best talent across our entire global organization and have no doubt that our results will drive meaningful value creation for shareholders. In closing, we feel great about our strategy, performance in improving how we operate the firm. We are building on our solid momentum to accelerate growth and create lasting impact. We are excited, confident and optimistic for what's ahead. Over to you, Curt. It's Kew. I hope you're doing well. Look, big picture, progress in Global Credit continues on track, and we're quite pleased with how things are going in. Right now, we've got about $60 billion of AUM. Just to remind you, it was at about $50 billion last year at this time, so about a 20% growth. As you pointed out, our CLO business is really doing well. It has priced a bunch of things in Europe and in the U.S., as Curt pointed out. We feel really good about that franchise. I just wanted to point out that the most important thing, that is - it's performing well. Its default rate and the performance for its investors is top notch. In terms of direct lending, we are looking for opportunities to continue to expand that platform. I think our BDC is performing quite well and our track record is such that we believe we are well positioned to continue raising money into that strategy. Opportunistic credit is just doing great. Not only is the track record thus far living to our expectations, but more importantly, delivering for LPs. But they are in the markets, so I want to be careful. The reception continues to be quite strong, and we're confident in our ability to continue driving to build out that whole platform. The one area that I would say is tougher in this environment is distressed credit. Obviously, with all the liquidity that's in the market, a rising tide lifts all boats, and I would say distressed credit is a little bit harder to see where we're going to find significant opportunities for ramp-up and deployment in the current conditions that we're seeing. And then finally, you mentioned aviation, so I'll give you a little bit of color on that platform. We're really pleased. The funds are performing well. The most recent SASOF fund just closed on a very large transaction, which I'm sure you read about. The portfolio quality is - through the most disruptive period of time you could have imagined in the travel business, in the aviation business, has performed, in our view, very, very well. And our LPs are quite happy with what they're doing. And so that's - that seeds the - that sets the stage for continued growth in that platform. So all in all, I think big picture, I just gave you a color - a bit of color across our platform, but big picture, we're feeling very good about our Credit platform and our ambitions to continue doubling that business as I laid out for you in our strategic plan. And Glenn, just to add on just a little bit with some numbers. Global Credit raised $3.2 billion in new capital this quarter, almost $12 billion over the last 12 months. That really drives that business. Now one of the things you'll see here in the first quarter, those four new CLOs, they haven't been on in terms of management fees for the whole quarter. So you got to keep that into account. And then the other thing that Kew pointed out on distressed credit, we did have one carry fund in there that had a step-down. And so that is a part of what you're seeing there. And then keep in mind that a lot of our Global Capital Markets transaction fees, which we're feeling really good about, come through that segment. And Q4 was a blowout for that piece in terms of at least looking at it historically from a Carlyle perspective. Q1 was also strong but a little bit of a step-down. So very pleased with the trajectory in Global Credit. Let me start. Maybe Curt will have a little bit of color to add at the end as well. Look, we are pursuing an asset-light model. We are an investment firm, and we believe if we can achieve our strategic plan, we're going to grow very nicely and drive high return on capital for our shareholders. Now that doesn't mean we're not going to use our balance sheet appropriately to grow. And you've seen what we've done with Fortitude, you've seen what we've done with the aviation platform, and yes, we do anchor all of our fundraising with significant investments from the balance sheet for purposes of alignment. So the way I would phrase it is while everyone is talking about asset-light, I believe we are an asset-right type of approach, which is focus as an investment firm, drive high growth and high return on capital and strategically use our balance sheet in the right way, that's my asset-right categorization, in the right way to step function our growth in the future. Yes, Craig, I would just say, at a higher level, we're just going to be very transparent and very direct about these types of issues. We really feel solid we feel great about our alignment. And accounting is accounting, but we're not going to use accounting to in lieu of substance. And so our investment professionals, they receive cash compensation. If the performance of their funds is strong, they will benefit with carry. That's in complete alignment with our limited partners and our shareholders who get a good share of that as we perform. And then, of course, finally, we have broader distribution of stock in the hands of those leaders that can really help drive performance on behalf of the whole enterprise. And we feel good about overall how we've compensated our professionals and how we've aligned them appropriately. Could we find different ways to optimize and better align as our objectives shift and as our plan evolves? Of course. And that's what we will always be looking to do. But as Curt lay out, we are very comfortable with the transparent and the clear and, quite frankly, the right down the middle of the fairway way that we've laid out compensation for all of you. Sure. Dean, it's Kew. Look, obviously, it's hard for me to talk specifically about anything in light of the rules and regs with respect to fundraising. So let me just put it this way and don't let the brevity of my answer don't read anything into that. Look, we feel really good about our fundraising and our fundraising prospects. Early reception has been quite positive. Our performance from our investment platform, as we lay out, is quite strong, and that provides a good backdrop for all of our fundraising discussions. The numbers that we posted this quarter, as Curt pointed out, are mostly from our Investment Solutions in our Credit business. And so our very large flagship products in GPE have formally announced and are in market as we speak. So hence, I'm going to be careful. We feel very good about our prospects. And there is one other thing that I'd like to point out. Over the past year, across our broad platform, right now, I'd say about 70% or more of our LPs have committed to more than three funds at Carlyle. That's up from about 60% at the end of 2020. So we're seeing broad positive reception. The environment is strong for fundraising. Our performance is very good. And let me just leave it at that and tell you we're pretty confident about our fundraising prospects. Sure. I appreciate the question. Look, as I laid out in our strategic plan, we are focused on building and scaling our strongest and our best platforms. And if we can do that, big will become bigger, but we will benefit from operating leverage. And you saw an example of that in this quarter when Curt announced the final closing of the sale of MRE out of our Investment Solutions business. Great franchise but not in keeping with our strategic plan principles of focusing on our biggest and best and scaling the biggest and best even more. So for example, in the past, you've seen us stop investing out of or move or sell fund complexes or fund products, I meant to say, that are, in our opinion, subscale and not really going to be moving the needle for us in a big way with respect to what our strategic ambitions are. In Asia, we've done this with certain growth product, in the Middle East, in Mexico, and there are numerous examples throughout our Global Private Equity franchise and in our Credit franchise where we've made the tough decisions but the strategically important decisions to say these are not part of our strategic plan. And now you've seen a platform with our redesign, focused on Global Private Equity, Global Credit and Investment Solutions, which we've streamlined and where our best strategies and teams are the ones that we are going to really support, grow and scale. And that really sets the foundation for the first big leg of our strategic plan, which is accelerating the growth of our best and strongest investment platforms. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color of how focused I am on this principle and how we continue to drive and build Carlyle around this moving forward. So a great question. And why don't I suggest we do this. I'll start, and between Curt and me, we will give you a pretty good sense. So I'll start with our CLO business, and you've specifically asked about performance. So our long-term default rate since 1999 is 1%, which is less than 1/3 of the LSTA index, which stands at 3.3%. So clearly, great performance relative to that index. And our net implied loss rate at the moment is 40 basis points versus the index at 1.2%. So we're one of the biggest investors in the CLO market in large part because our performance is great. And we're recognized for that, which is why we've been, I believe, so busy and why this platform will continue to grow. Go ahead, Curt. All right. Let me appreciate the question. Look, SMA is an important part of our business, specifically it relates to Solutions. We raised, I think, a little over $2 billion just in SMAs with respect to AlpInvest. And that's part of the success we've been having in that business. Over time, we expect to see larger and larger co-mingled funds. But this is an asset class that is growing, and we have real interest from very large LPs who would like to structure unique programs with us. And of course, to the extent we can do that in an economically attractive way and something that makes sense for our business, we will engage in those types of discussions. But more broadly speaking, SMAs, as it relates to Solutions but also in the Credit business is something that we've been having real success in. And we carefully are growing that to ensure that we're doing that in a way which is building the business but is doing it in an economically accretive way. It's Kew. Look, the environment right now is very robust in the capital markets. And when you marry that with the fact that we've been working really hard on the investment platform side, investing, working with our portfolio companies and our funds that we think have been constructed well, those portfolios are maturing and they're seasoning. And so to the extent that we can take advantage of these capital market conditions, you should expect that we will be doing that. And that is why I made the comment that the pipeline of realizations continues to grow and we intend to be active. Now look, my crystal ball isn't perfect with respect to capital market conditions in the future. And so I just want to point out that a big part of the appreciation and our views on realizations are dependent in large part on making sure dependent in large part on the environment being healthy. And to the extent that, that is the case, we do expect to see a meaningful ramp-up in exit activity, which should drive strong distributable earnings for the balance of the year and beyond. Chris, the only thing I would add is - I thought where you're going with your question is in terms of adjacencies above and beyond our core businesses. Curt did point out the success we're having in vehicles like CPI, which is our core-plus real estate fund. But also our Global Capital Markets business, only six months in, we feel really good about. We've established a globally coordinated team. We know what we're trying to do in terms of risk, and we're executing at a revenue run rate right now which is beating our expectations, quite frankly. So we've got we feel really good about momentum there. And obviously, we haven't talked about it on this call, but everything we're doing at Fortitude and in the insurance space continue to be exciting for us. We're very busy. Fortitude, the platform is performing very well. And I believe it's just a matter of time before we see growth in that platform, which then comes back to benefit Carlyle and our investment management activities. So it's a fulsome answer for you, Chris, but we feel pretty good about what's happening above and beyond the first major leg of our plan, which is our core investment platform."

            "name": "Curtis Buser",
            "content": "Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks, I will address three areas to support and build upon Kew's opening comments. First, I'll provide additional context around the strong first quarter carry fund appreciation and our record accrued carry balance. Second, I will quickly review our first quarter results, and finally, leave you with some considerations looking forward. So let's begin with the higher portfolio valuations. Our investment portfolios are generally in great shape, concentrated in high-quality assets, diversified by sector and vintage and managed by highly experienced investment teams. Continued improvements in operating performance at the individual portfolio company level and increasing public and private market valuation levels were tailwinds to valuation this quarter. Add in greater economic certainty alongside historically low interest rates, and our funds benefited from significant fair value increases in the quarter. With the past few quarters' strong appreciation, our most recent fully invested flagship buyout funds are all at the upper end of relative performance as compared to their predecessors, and the investing generation of these funds is also tracking favorably. We believe this position these strategies very well upon their return to the market. This appreciation resulted in a significant increase in our net accrued carry balance, which we already noted rose to $3.2 billion, up 36% from $2.3 billion just last quarter. The size of the accrual has accelerated, and its composition has diversified. We currently have five funds that have more than $100 million in net accrued carry. Carlyle Partners VI remains early in its cash generation cycle and have a net accrued carry balance of nearly $1.4 billion. And we have not yet realized any carry from our latest fully invested Asia and Europe buyout funds, though both funds are performing very well and are also now in accrued carry. Notably, three significant carry funds posted very strong appreciation and moved into carry this quarter, including our fourth generation Europe Buyout and Europe Technology funds, each of which appreciated more than 25%, and our currently investing seventh U.S. buyout fund, which appreciated 10%. Keep in mind, however, that our seventh U.S. buyout fund and our fourth Europe Technology fund remain in their investment periods and could move in and out of accrued carry as they fully invest their capital. Let me now move to a review of our first quarter results. We generated $215 million in distributable earnings and DE per share of $0.58 for the quarter, an increase of 21% over a year ago. The growth has driven - was driven by a $30 million or 30% increase in fee-related earnings to $129 million when adjusting for the $30 million in legal recoveries a year ago. Our FRE margin this quarter of 31% was up about 600 basis points from an as-adjusted 25% a year ago. Positively impacting FRE this quarter was a higher level of transaction fees, which had $15 million in the quarter and $36 million over the past six months, illustrates the strong traction Carlyle Global Capital Markets is already experiencing as we focus on growing this earnings adjacency. We're excited about this growth adjacency and believe we have significant room to continue to expand, as outlined at our Investor Day. Net realized performance revenues of $76 million for the quarter increased significantly compared to last year, but on a longer-term view, remain low by our historic standards. We expect to see both the pace of exits and performance revenues associated with those exits increase significantly. Realized investment income was $30 million and was higher than any quarter in 2020. With investments on our balance sheet now at $1.8 billion on a projected healthy exit pace, investment income should remain higher than in prior periods. Fundraising was also strong out of the gate, $7.8 billion of new capital raised this quarter. Similar to last year, activity was driven mostly by Global Credit and Investment Solutions. Our fundraising mix should shift more toward Global Private Equity later this year as several GPE funds are expected to have first closings. In the first quarter, we took advantage of a strong CLO market to issue four new CLOs, three in the U.S. and one in Europe. And in April, AlpInvest held a final close on its latest co-investment fund at $3.5 billion, more than twice as large as its predecessor fund. Fees on this program will begin with second quarter results. Finally, let me cover a few items to look out for over the next few quarters. First, we expect significant distributable earnings growth as our exit pace increases across our platform. For example, we have already announced exits for Ithaca, MedRisk and PPD in Carlyle Partners VI and Ameos in Carlyle Europe Partners III, all of which should close over the next few quarters. G&A expense continues to benefit from lower travel and conference expenditures as well as lower professional fees. So we expect G&A will increase throughout 2021 as activity normalizes but is likely to remain below prior peak levels. Equity-based compensation expense of $35 million was up versus $32 million a year ago and reflects the impact of February strategic equity grants. Equity-based compensation expense will modestly increase next quarter to reflect a full quarter of expense amortization on these awards and will likely remain at those levels for the near to medium term. Our effective DE tax rate, which was approximately 5% for the first quarter, reflects the ongoing utilization of existing tax operating loss carryforwards, but we continue to expect our full year effective DE tax rate to wind up closer to a mid-teen blended rate. We maintained our dividend at $0.25 per share for the quarter and expected to remain at this level for the balance of the year. Over time, we would expect our fixed dividend to grow with FRE beginning as early as next year. We are committed to maintaining a balance sheet-light approach and have ample resources to accomplish our organic growth objectives. And with the persistence of a low-rate environment, we continue to assess opportunities to optimize our capital structure and lower our average cost of capital. And finally, subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of Metropolitan Real Estate for a small gain and subleased its previous office space in New York, which will result in a GAAP charge in the second quarter for the loss on the sublease. Both the sale of MRE and the sublease will modestly improve our FRE margins prospectively. In sum, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the exceptional performance of our funds. We remain on track to meet or exceed our 2024 goals to grow our pre-tax distributable earnings to at least $1.6 billion with an attractive mix of sustainable fee-related earnings and strong performance from our funds and investments. We'll continue to keep you updated on our progress. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. And the only thing I'll add to that, Patrick, is we have ample resources to be able to fund our organic plan. And we're looking at, just as we talked about on our Investor Day, opportunities in an opportunistic manner. And we'll continue to review our capital structure in terms of what we think is best at the right time to take advantage of the market and to continue to really drive a growth trajectory for all stakeholders in the firm. Craig thanks. Let me start and then maybe Kew will add in. What we have really done is really try to grow fee-related earnings and distributable earnings the old-fashioned way by earning it one step at a time, growing the business, doing the things right. And we're not trying to hide the ball in terms of our true compensation. So all of our base and bonus is clearly spelled out, and that's all within fee related earnings. And within our performance revenues, there is a portion of that, generally, it's 45% is shared with the deal teams and with people. And so that's the basic compensation model that's not been tweaked. Obviously, we grant equity awards on top of that. But it's right down the center of the fairway kind of approach, earning it as we go. We'll continue to look at ways to incentivize our people in different ways, but right now, we're feeling pretty good about our overall plans in terms of how to attract and retain key talent It's Curt. Thanks for your question, very astute. One of the things that I've always been really proud of Carlyle is just the level of commitment of all of our investment professionals as well as really all of the employee base to invest in our products. So we eat what we sell. So huge alignment in terms of being invested in it. In fact, it's clearly, the majority of the capital that goes into our funds really comes out of those after-tax dollars from our people. And guess what, that's highly diversified. And so we're not dependent upon any single person, and the balance sheet is obviously there to fund it. So as I look forward, the real issue is we're going from $100 billion to $110 billion before to $130 billion plus, and it's the incremental on that, which is really what's key, and I'm comfortable that our strategies are appropriate to be able to fund all of that. So look, I think just as I said before, Mike, the fundraising has been really strong, and that's really in this business, you have to perform in order to fund raise. The CLOs have done really well. Despite some of our concerns a year ago, but the team has really kind of done all the way down, which is manage default rates. And then in a lot of our other products like we talked about aviation before, but if you really talk about some of the retail products that we have as well as in direct lending, those are performing very well. And the new dollars that are coming in continue to track, not to mention things like infrastructure credit, and we're even starting to put together some things and other asset-backed lending areas. So more to come around some of that in terms of building out not just aviation and infrastructure but in other places as well. So all of that is really being put together by fund by actual performance. I need to be a little careful, Mike, in terms of how specific I can be because the BDC has not yet reported and I don't want to front run our own BDC from a public perspective. I don't have all that at my fingertips, Mike. So maybe we can do something at a subsequent point in time. Just picking up on the comment around distribution pace for investment solutions. So again, a lot of that, we're dealing with primary fund of funds, secondary co-invest. And so it's really kind of as you see the overall markets returning, they're then getting that cash. Now one thing I want to point out to you is on page 10 of our release, you'll see that the net accrued performance revenue with respect to Solutions has gone from $110 million net a year ago to $191 million. And so that's very good improvement from the net accrued carry. And more and more, as we these new programs, a much larger percentage, 40%, comes to Carlyle as that's realized. Keep in mind, these are European style waterfalls, so it takes a while for that to flush through and come to us. So I would not expect a huge increase in the immediate future, but I do think that the amount of carry that Investment Solutions contributes to the firm will be more meaningful, especially next year and the year thereafter than it has been in the recent past. But look, Global Private Equity will continue to be the lion's share of our realized carry. And just adding on that, Robert. I mean, I think we gave very clear color that we expect increases in both distributable earnings and really being driven off of our expected realization activity. And the pipeline that I called out in my prepared remarks, Ameos and Europe Partners III, Ithaca, PPD and MedRisk and Carlyle Partners VI, those are deals that are already announced and they're in funds that are taking cash carry. So you can just kind of see, obviously, that there are clear pathways to very good realization activity in the near term. So let me maybe start. Just our core-plus real estate platform is doing really well, growing very good. And that is one that's just ever opened. So that's not one that we need to reduce. So it's a core-plus strategy. It's evergreen. And the trajectory here has been fantastic in terms of raise, and Rob Stuckey and the team have done a really nice job of how they've invested that. And so we're very optimistic with respect to that. In our private equity space, that's where it is more, as you pointed out, traditional from a - you need to reload, but those are longer-duration investment periods and longer-life funds. And so look, at least in terms of my preparation, when you start getting up in 10-to-20-year time periods that gets the feel very kind of permanent. And look, even our regular funds that generally have a six-year investment period and then take another five or six years thereafter to fully realize, they're very sticky. And 90% of that 98% of that is really very sticky capital. Management fee is coming from that. So it's the business from a permanence perspective, I think, feels really good. I don't know, Kew, if there is anything you want to add to that."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Bill Conway; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release to the extent reasonably available.  Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. I'm going to begin with a quick discussion of our results, and then hand the call over to Bill. For the fourth quarter, we generated $202 million in fee-related earnings and $433 million in distributable earnings or $1.01 per share. Fee-related earnings for the full year 2022 of $834 million increased 40% compared to 2021 and FRE margin expanded to 37% from 33% last year. Strong organic growth and several strategic transactions combined to deliver another year of substantial growth. We generated $1.9 billion in distributable earnings in 2022 or $4.34 per share with a good balance of earnings from FRE, net realized performance revenue and realized investment income. We entered 2023 in a strong capital position. We have $1.4 billion in cash, $2.4 billion in firm investments and $4 billion of net accrued carry on our balance sheet, in total, over $20 per share. We have nothing drawn against our $1 billion revolver, and our debt ratings from both S&P and Fitch improved to A minus ratings. The strength of our balance sheet gives us confidence that we can continue to pursue growth strategies, both organic and inorganic, to help continue to deliver additional FRE growth.  We delivered a quarterly dividend of $0.325 per common share. The combination of our balance sheet strength and sustainable growth in FRE allowed our Board of Directors to approve another increase in our fixed dividend to $1.40 per share per year, an increase of 8% year-over-year and up 40% over the past 2 years. This higher dividend will begin with Q1.  And with that, let me turn the call over to our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Bill Conway.\nWilliam Conway: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be on the call to discuss Carlyle's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results. As you've heard, Carlyle delivered strong results to our stakeholders despite the challenging market environment. The firm is operating well, and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to capture investment opportunities and to continue to grow our platform in 2023.  I want to talk about 3 topics this morning: the outcome of our CEO selection, the strong financial performance of Carlyle in 2022 and some general thoughts on our outlook. First, we are incredibly pleased that Harvey Schwartz will join Carlyle as the new CEO on February 15. As you all know, this was an incredibly important decision for Carlyle. And the search committee of the Board, on which I serve, drove a robust and exhaustive search for a new CEO. Following a thorough and competitive process, Harvey was unanimously chosen by the Board as the right leader to move Carlyle forward in its next phase of growth.  Harvey is a widely respected business builder with significant leadership experience in a high-performing, highly competitive global financial institution. He is a seasoned operator with a proven record of leading and developing a wide range of businesses and a demonstrated ability to invest in and develop the talent and organizational structure to manage and support these businesses.  As we look to the future, there is tremendous opportunity to grow and to continue to perform Carlyle, to transform Carlyle and deliver sustainable results over the long term. Harvey brings the experience and skill set to fully capture this opportunity.  As CEO, he will set and execute a strategy that advances and accelerates the diversification plan the firm has successfully pursued as well as identify new investment opportunities to further scale the business, drive performance and deliver growth. I am confident in Harvey's leadership and look forward to introducing him to you in the very near future.  Moving on, I'd like to discuss our 2022 results. Curt will dive into our results in more detail, but I wanted to touch on a few notable points. As Dan mentioned, we generated record fee-related earnings of $834 million in 2022, an increase of 40% over 2021, which demonstrates that our strategic focus to grow FRE and diversify our earnings mix is paying off, and we earned $1.9 billion in distributable earnings despite a volatile exit environment.  We delivered investment returns that were attractive across our portfolio. Our aggregate carry fund portfolio appreciated 11% in the year, while the public markets were down about 20%. And as I said last quarter, portfolio construction and risk management matter, and we believe that this is the key differentiator that positions our investment teams to deliver superior relative performance across market cycles.  Turning to our outlook. As we enter 2023, we are confident in the strong foundation of the firm and believe that we are well positioned to capture new growth opportunities, and Harvey will focus on building off this strong foundation. At its core, our business involves raising money and investing money and then making money that we've invested worth more.  Let me begin with some thoughts on fundraising. No doubt the backdrop for raising new capital remains challenging with headwinds more pronounced in certain areas than others. However, today's environment is different from what we faced entering 2022. Early last year, an unexpected and sharp change in market sentiment had investors on their back foot for most of the year. With rapidly deteriorating public equity and debt prices, the denominator effect greatly reduced LP interest and ability to make new commitments.  Over the past few months, at least until last week, we've seen a gradual reduction in market volatility. Investors still believe that they have a better handle on the magnitude of further interest rate changes. In addition, Carlyle's longstanding relationships with the largest and most sophisticated investors around the globe is a benefit, and we continue to see strong demand for many of our investment strategies across our 3 global segments.  Our platform has continued to diversify, and it's important to note that roughly 2/3 of our fundraising last year came from areas such as Global Credit, Global Investment Solutions, natural resources and real estate. While corporate private equity may continue to face headwinds, we see significant capital raising opportunities across our platform. We will have more strategies raising capital in 2023 than we did in 2022, including our next vintage flagship funds and credit opportunities, secondaries, co-investments and buyout funds across the globe.  We anticipate that our overall dollar volume of fundraising in 2023 will be higher than the $30 billion we raised in 2022. Over the past few months, I've been around the world speaking with our teams and investors and feel confident in the power of our platform. Our investors value our partnership, our global reach and our ability to construct diverse portfolios that perform across market cycles.  Now that Harvey is here, it has also taken away some uncertainty about our path forward as a firm, and we think that will also have a positive impact on fundraising. Regarding capital development, today's market conditions create new opportunities to invest capital across all of our global businesses. Recently, there's been a wider-than-average spread in pricing expectations between buyers and sellers, which has impacted capital development. The spread is across most asset classes that has been more pronounced in private equity than other strategies, and we are -- but we are starting to see evidence of this spread narrowing. As debt and equity capital markets continue to reopen, the pace of deal activity is poised to accelerate.  We deployed a record $35 billion in capital in 2022 with a good balance across equity, credit and solution strategies. And we are well positioned for further investment with $72 billion in dry powder to capitalize on an improving environment. We expect to find ample opportunities to make new investments in 2023 and beyond on behalf of our fund investors. In addition, the improving deal environment presents an opportunity for our global credit business to provide unique capital solutions to the marketplace. In 2022, we underwrote $3.9 billion of new loan activity in our direct lending strategy, and our CLO team issued 9 new CLOs while also trading $30 billion across their portfolios to better position the CLOs for the expected economic environment.  And as fund investors' need for liquidity persists, we are well positioned to capitalize on this need to our secondaries and co-investments business. Overall, 2022 was a solid year across most financial metrics for Carlyle, and we entered 2023 with strength and momentum. With Harvey as our new CEO alongside our strong leadership team, Carlyle is well positioned and we're confident that he will build on this momentum to bolster the firm's position and create value for all our investors and shareholders.  With that, let me hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser, to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by reiterating many things Bill mentioned that emphasize the strong position Carlyle finds itself in as we begin this year. We believe our investment portfolios are in good shape and are well positioned to weather economic volatility. And we expect to deliver long-term attractive performance for all of our stakeholders.  We produced a robust $4.34 per share in distributable earnings in 2022, displaying the significant cash earnings power of our firm. We've now earned over $9 in DE per share in just the past 2 years. We remain focused on growing fee-related earnings, and it grew by 40% in 2022. And over the past 5 years, our FRE CAGR has been a robust 34%. Our overall earnings mix continues to diversify as we have grown our credit, insurance, capital markets and solutions capabilities. Our strong growth in fee-related earnings is not driven by a single fund or strategy. Rather, our performance led us to driving broad-based top line fee growth across our global platform.  Top line fee revenue growth was 25% in 2022 and was driven by the following: first, raising capital for and growing our traditional high-performing investment strategies across each segment -- each of our 3 global segments. Second, organically building out new fee-generating businesses like opportunistic credit, insurance, capital markets and infrastructure credit, to name just a few, each of which added significantly to our growing fee revenue pool throughout the year. And third, we have been actively adding new inorganic streams of earnings, such as our transactions to further scale our CLO business with CBAM, and our advisory agreement with Fortitude.  These efforts have scaled our platform and helped drop more of our top line revenues to the bottom line as we expanded our full year FRE margin to 37% in 2022, an increase of nearly 400 basis points compared to 2021. FRE margin has more than doubled over the past 5 years. We have done this while concurrently investing in new product development and enhanced distribution capabilities, notably across the private wealth channel. We expect to continue to grow FRE in 2023. FRE in the first quarter will likely be similar to Q4 of 2022 before increasing in the second half of the year. In addition, we remain highly confident in our ability to grow FRE well into the double-digit range over the mid- to longer term, in line or better than the market trends across the private capital industry.  Consistent growth in fee-related earnings is supported by the attractive investment returns we produce for our fund investors. Our investment teams again delivered appreciation that outperformed public benchmarks even with increasingly higher discount and cap rate assumptions in our valuation models and elevated concerns about global recession. While only 6% of our carry fund portfolio was publicly traded at year-end, public market comparables are an important input to our valuation methodology and generally were a downward driver of valuations across our private assets during the year.  Of course, the most important valuation driver of any investment is underlying asset level performance, which, in general, continued to reflect growth in revenues and earnings, though this growth generally slowed in the second half of 2022. Our strong performance also owes to our focus on deploying capital in the sectors where we have deep industry expertise and experience.  Our real estate funds appreciated 16% during 2022. Our Infrastructure & Natural Resource funds appreciated a very strong 48%, and Corporate Private Equity funds were up 6%. We realized $34 billion in proceeds for the year, which produced another year with $1 billion in net realized performance revenue. About what I previously indicated would be a good target in most years.  Looking forward, net accrued carry increased 2% year-over-year to $4 billion. A solid portfolio appreciation more than offset strong carry realizations. And we ended the year with $138 billion in fair value in our carry funds, up more than 10% compared to year-end 2021. In general, we continue to expect to generate on average $1 billion in annual net realized carry.  Though depending on the year, realized performance income could be elevated as it was in 2021 when market factors were favorable or lower in years where uncertainty diminishes capital markets activity. Industry-wide activity rates slowed considerably in the past few months as buyers and sellers continue to search for evaluation middle ground, and funding markets while available are less amenable than they were just a year ago.  For Carlyle specifically, new investment and realization activity has also been slower. And so we expect a muted start to 2023 for both deployment and realizations. Thus, transaction revenue and realized performance income will be lower over the next quarter or 2. If our activity rates across the industry improve over the next few months, then our expectations for higher performance and transaction revenues will also increase.  Let me now turn to some quick thoughts on each of the business segments. Global Private Equity had another strong year with fee-related earnings up 34%. Strong appreciation across Real Estate, Infrastructure and Natural Resources helped net accrued carry increase to $3.5 billion after more than $900 million of net carry realizations. $20 billion of invested capital was generally similar to $23 billion of realized proceeds, which positions global private equity to continue to deliver attractive levels of distributable earnings in future periods.  Global Credit remains our fastest-growing segment, and it benefited from both organic growth activity as well as the positive impact from strategic transactions. Top line fee revenues grew 46% in 2022, resulted in fee-related earnings more than doubling to $225 million, and fee-related earnings margins increasing by nearly 1,000 basis points to 37%.  Strong investment performance across various strategies produced $70 million of net realized performance revenue. Our credit interval fund delivered attractive performance with a 10% dividend yield, while continued net inflows grew managed assets to more than $2 billion. We raised $15 billion in new capital across 11 strategies in Global Credit in 2022, and we expect to have an active year fundraising for additional strategies in 2023, which should position Global Credit for further growth. In addition, we remain focused on helping Fortitude evaluate new growth opportunities, which would help us benefit from incremental advisory revenues.  And in Global Investment Solutions, we are well positioned to see growth in this segment as we begin fundraising for our flagship products, including next vintages in our co-investment and secondary strategies. Fee-related earnings of $69 million in 2022 was lower than 2021, but we expect to see growth later in 2023, as these strategies attract new capital. In addition, with $374 million in net accrued carry and very strong fund performance, performance-related revenues are well positioned to increase over time.  In sum, we delivered strong performance for our stakeholders in 2022 and are well positioned for what will likely be a more attractive investment environment in 2023. We see tremendous opportunity to deploy capital into what we think will be a great investment for our portfolio and fund investors. Now let me turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So maybe for Bill, first. Look, I think a lot of investors have been getting on board the direction of travel for Carlyle for the last couple of years, FRE growth, margin expansion, diversification. So we had a pause for 6 or 7 months. We found Harvey. Maybe talk a little bit more about why Harvey and then, most importantly, what's he here to do relative to the strategy that all these investors are on board? And I want to know, like, is that strategy important to you and the co-founders because the process we went through is what it is? So just curious if you could talk to that.\nWilliam Conway: Sure. And thank you for the question, Glenn. First of all, I am very excited that Harvey is going to join us. He was our first choice, and he is -- and I think it should be pretty obvious why. We were looking for somebody who had a really proven track record. We were looking for somebody who had experience building businesses. We were looking for somebody who had a record of managing and recruiting and training and developing talent and working in the collaborative environment. We were looking for somebody who could relate to people like you in Wall Street and tell our story, a wide range of skills. And frankly, there aren't a lot of people who have all those skills.  In Harvey, I think we found that person. He is really fantastic. Yesterday, he and I were walking around our New York office. We went on all the floors, we were talking to people, and he was happy to see them, and they were happy to see him. And it was really not so much they want to get rid of me, but rather they were excited to see him there. We obviously have a lot of people who used to work for Goldman, and they were happy to see him; and people who just had heard about him and his track record and his skill set.  So I think why Harvey and who he is and what his track record is, that was pretty clear to me that we couldn't get anybody any better than Harvey. He was -- he's fantastic. Now what's he here to do? I think in some ways, the path that we have is set. We want to -- first of all, we want to increase the stock price. Even though we are -- we've got a great investment track record that doesn't show up in our stock price, we have -- how is he going to do that? Well, we have to grow our business, we have to grow our business, we have to grow our business. Particularly the fee-related earnings, but other parts of the business as well that assets and the like, he's got a great set of experiences. Remember, he was at Goldman during the time of a financial crisis and talking about having to deal with situations that were risky and yet had great opportunity. So I don't see dramatic changes in the basic strategy, but it will be up to Harvey. He's going to be the CEO of the company. And I'm going to do everything I can to help him be successful and -- including staying out of his way, if that's the right part of the solution. I can't tell you how happy I am that he's here.\nGlenn Schorr: Well, long track record with him, so I totally agree with that. Maybe just one numbers question. I'm interested in your comments about the improving bid-ask dynamic. You have $11 or so in net accrued performance revenue, which is a lot relative to your stock price, like you said. So you realized $1 billion in performance revenue, but you picked up another $1 billion basically on the back of Infrastructure and Natural Resources. So could you expand a little bit more on what you talked about the improving bid dynamic -- bid-ask dynamic? Is that like a near-term-ish thing? Or is that a hopefully second half thing? Just curious on what you think it takes to get the wheels moving again.\nWilliam Conway: That is -- that the real question is. And of course, what we're talking about there is that sellers think their businesses were worth what they were worth a year or 2 ago. And buyers say, \"Well, I don't want to pay those prices anymore.\" And so there's been a gap. I've mentioned in my remarks that it's been both in the prices of equities, we see it kind of on the value of the companies that you own, but it also applies to credit. For example, there was a deal recently and we looked at where the credit spread or all in price of the credit a year ago might have been 6% or 6.5%, and now it's double digits. So there are still certainly some disparities in valuation.  However, it is getting better, Glenn. And I'd say it's getting better slowly. It's not rapidly. This is not going to be something that I think it -- someone is going to ring the buzz and we're going to know that it's where it should be. Private equity has the advantage and private debt too as well of being able to evolve and able to function in lots of different kinds of environments and to adjust to those environments. And I see that in the types of deals that we do now. We're not doing deals that are giant deals that require billions -- $10 billion of equity and $10 billion of credit. Those deals will be almost impossible to do today.  But the market is gradually healing. Buyers and sellers gradually coming together. And I think it's on both sides. I think buyers are dropping the prices down and I think -- price what they're willing to pay. And the sellers are saying, well, maybe we're going to have to just be able to settle for a lower price than we thought. And I think that's across the board. It's not going to be just in private equity, it's not going to be just in Americas, it's everywhere. More in the second half probably than the first.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.\nWilliam Katz: Congrats on adding Mr. Schwartz. So a question for you, guys. You mentioned that you think that asset gathering can be better in '23 than in 2022. I was wondering if you could unpack that a little bit and maybe bifurcate between where you stand on sort of the free flagship corporate private equity portfolios versus the rest of the business with some emphasis on the solutions business?\nCurtis Buser: Bill, it's Curt. Thanks for your question. I'll start and then Bill might add in. So I'm really proud of what we did in 2022 from a deployment standpoint. We deployed $35 billion across the portfolio. It was actually our most deployment in any year. And between '22 and '23, it was noticeably better than what it had been in all prior years. Bill talked about some of the challenges here recently, and we think that, that's going to pick back up.  The diversification across the platform and deployment I was really proud of because what you saw in '23 was much more coming out of Global Credit and other aspects of even private equity outside of corporate private equity. And so all of that was really good. So the deployment piece was really good. That leads us into a good place from a fundraising perspective and sets us up well for fundraising.  And so because it's the first and foremost thing, I think, is kind of how the portfolios are performing and then how you think about fundraising. So from a fundraising standpoint, a couple of high-level things for you to keep in mind. Our portfolios are performing really well. And this, I think, sets us up nicely to go as we seek to raise more capital.  Second, as Bill said, we expect to raise more in 2023 than we did in 2022, and we'll have more products in the market to support this. The third thing from a number standpoint, I want you to keep in mind is, in 2021, at the beginning of the year, we said we would raise $130-plus billion over 4 years. So 2 years in, we've raised $80 billion, $50 billion last year, $30 billion this year. And we added $65 billion through strategic transactions. So that's $145 billion of new fee-earning AUM in just 2 years. And you see that in our fee-related earnings, up 40%, 30-plus CAGR over the last 5 years. And so that's done really well. And we've seen a lot of that growth really in credit and in our solutions business. Now in the buyout funds, we still have, obviously, some congestion in that space, but there's a number of reasons to have optimism there. First, as Bill said, I think there's less uncertainty about the global markets today than it was a year ago. Second, public markets seem to be improving here in early days of the year, but it's still early. Third, we're in '23. So that's a new set of allocations for investors. And last, with the appointment of Harvey Schwartz, we have a lot of reason to be excited. And we hope that, that carries forward to our investors and taking away some uncertainty that may linger there in certain situations.  But look, I'll reiterate that I think that our buyout funds will be similar in size to their previous vintages. And so I'm confident in that and very excited about kind of our overall growth in the firm. And I think that this will be a better year from a fundraising perspective than it was in 2022 and, again, helping us in our focus on driving fee-related earnings.\nWilliam Conway: Okay. And just a follow-up, maybe stick with you, Curt. So just sort of triangulating the notion of FRE up in '23 over '22, just sort of wondering how you might be able to ring-fence that. And then just given the sort of yet to be determined incremental strategy with Mr. Schwartz, how should we think about margins? Because I hear a lot of grow the business, grow the business, grow the business. Can you drive FRE up and FRE margins up if you still need to grow the business?\nCurtis Buser: Bill, look, I said that we're confident we're going to grow fee-related earnings in '23. I think the first quarter will be a little flat, as I said in my remarks. But thereafter, I think things are really set up nicely. There's -- this is a challenging environment, and we are continuing to invest and that's why I think this might be a little lower rate of total growth than, say, in the past, but feeling really good about our ability to grow fee-related earnings. I think with Harvey coming on, his past experience in helping companies and helping situations improve profitability will be a good addition to the team, will bring new thoughts to this. But I also want to be careful and give him the opportunity to put his imprint on things. And so I want to be a little cautious in terms of how much specificity I give in guidance, but we're really well set up to begin '23.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Maybe just to follow up the prior discussion from Bill's question. It sounds like you guys still feel pretty confident about the overall fundraising targets that you laid out couple of years ago, but the mix might be slightly different. Obviously, you highlighted the private equity business is a little bit slower. Can you expand on that a little bit? And as you think about the ramp that you're talking about into 2023 from FRE growth, what are some of the key products and strategies that you expect to be kind of the biggest contributors to that ramp?\nCurtis Buser: Alex, it's Curt. Let me start and then Bill can add. So look, credit did about $15 billion this past year. It's going to have more product in the market than last, feeling really good about how that continues. Our opportunistic credit fund is out there raising money. Our CLO business will probably start the year a little slower because of all the reasons we've talked about. But I think it's always a heavy weight in the room.  And then in the solutions business, we've got our co-investment products and our secondaries products and a couple of new things that we'll bring to market this year. And so again, more products in that space. Think of the solutions business as really being a nice way to kind of really increase from where they were in 2022. And then in private equity, look, we're going to have more product in the market in private equity. So a number of buyout funds, U.S., Europe, Asia, will either begin or will be in the market from a fundraising perspective. There's other products in private equity that will be in the market. And so that, too, I think, is well positioned to do better. I don't know, Bill, if you have anything to add.\nWilliam Conway: Yes. I think solution is going to be a big growing fund and the funds of solutions are going to be a pretty big growing area this year. I also -- I don't want to confine Harvey in any way. I don't want my comments in any way to limit his ability to imagine a different future or a different way that things could be done better. So I'm a little hesitant to get too specific on this. But I do think that the noncorporate private equity funds, the demand is there, too.  I used that credit example before when I was answering a prior question. Sometimes when it's a little tougher to raise the equity, raising the credit funds is a little easier because the opportunity is great, the spreads are wider and more money can be made by the investors in those funds. But I don't want to confine my answer in any way that will limit Harvey and his ability to do a great job.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. All right. We'll stay tuned for -- when Harvey is on.\nWilliam Conway: Thank you. You know Harvey? Do you know Harvey?\nAlexander Blostein: I have met Harvey, yes.\nWilliam Conway: Okay. Good. I just -- I didn't know whether or not another Goldman Sachs person might weigh in and what a great guy he is.\nAlexander Blostein: My quick follow-up for you guys was around Fortitude. That's something you mentioned in your prepared remarks as well. And I think, Curt, you highlighted some new growth initiatives within that, that can kind of help expedite some of the growth as well. Can you expand on that a bit as well?\nCurtis Buser: Sure, Alex. So look, Fortitude has got $50 billion, $51 billion of AUM. The way we've set up the services arrangement, we fee off of all of that. In addition, they've invested about 9 -- or I should say, committed about $9 billion into our funds. So all of that has been working as planned. They also have about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of excess capital, which positions them nicely to continue to grow, very active pipeline, working really hard on that.  We've said before that we fully expect that to be -- for them to be able to double in size because of that and fully expect that, that will occur. And when we have more to be able to say on those fronts, we'll be sure to mention that to you. But we remain very optimistic about kind of how Fortitude can continue to benefit Carlyle.\nWilliam Conway: I'd also tell you that Fortitude has -- we have 4 or 5 institutional partners who are in that business and are fellow shareholders with us in Fortitude. And they have been fabulous partners helping us grow that business. For us, it still is -- we got a lot of capital invested, but we have less than we otherwise would, thanks to those great partners we have. And as Curt said, we do expect to double that business over the next few years at least.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: I wanted to get a little bit more on the CP -- this PE fundraising issues. Could you maybe update us -- I know it's early in the year, but update us on the tone of the conversations with LPs? Are you starting to see people kind of step back into PE more broadly? And thoughts on maybe a more specific time line for when we can see some more chunky closings in those large flagship funds? And then maybe through the lens of all that, is it fair to say 4Q is about as bad as you think it could get in that line?\nCurtis Buser: Patrick, let me start on this, but I'm always sensitive about trying to read into the minds of others or really try to figure this out in detail. Look, we have great relations with our LP investors. I think they're pleased with what we're doing. A lot of our portfolio performance has been just fantastic and well constructed. And as I already went through a litany of things in terms of what we've done well, $145 billion of capital formation in the past 2 years, I think that we can continue to do that in terms of growing and looking, we'll continue to look at organic things.  So look, I think the tone is good, but it's still difficult in different places. And tone, you got to be specific related to kind of individual situations in the given fund and the like. And there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic as we start '23. So Bill, I don't know if you have anything to add to that?\nWilliam Conway: No more specifics to give at this time, Curt. Sorry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKenneth Worthington: Maybe first, private markets investing in energy. As you start to come back to market with more of these funds, how does the better environment in energy mesh with pension fund community that seems more reluctant to invest further in traditional energy? And what does this mean for your ability to grow your energy franchise in what seems like a more constructive energy environment?\nCurtis Buser: Ken, well said. I mean, I do think that we're optimistic on the energy platforms. Our partners and colleagues at NGP are excited about their opportunities. They've got a fund in the market now. I don't want to comment specifically on that, but expecting good things out of that. Our renewables platform, our power business, our international energy platform all give us a number of products, but they're not all in the market. But you're right. Right now, there's a lot of good opportunity in energy, but different LPs based on their constituencies have different perspectives.  The limited experience that we have is that generally, we're seeing a nice uptick from the existing investors in existing product, which is different than kind of going after new or different, but it's a good opportunity at the present time.\nWilliam Conway: And I think its returns are pretty uncorrelated with all the other returns available in the market, too, and that appeals to a certain group of investors as well.\nKenneth Worthington: Okay. So do you -- are you -- do you think the business can grow? Or does it just sort of stay here as those 2 trends offset each other?\nCurtis Buser: Look, the needs are really significant. I think a lot of that has played out. And so it's too early, Ken, to really call that definitively. But look, I feel a whole heck of a lot better about that whole sector than say, 2 years ago where it felt a lot more difficult. Right now, everything, performance and the chance forward on a lot of those different aspects, I think, are really, really good.\nKenneth Worthington: And then equity comp fell a bunch during the quarter. What drove it? And I assume we see that sort of snap back next year?\nCurtis Buser: Yes. That's -- look, like a lot of things in this business, looking at any individual quarter is a mistake. You got to look at it over a longer period of time. The fourth quarter had some unusual things in it. Essentially, our fourth quarter is always a little bit light because you've completed a vesting of a big tranche in the third quarter. And you haven't granted anything new that occurs in February. So the fourth quarter is naturally a low quarter, plus we had some performance units for some senior folks that didn't fully there that had been accrued prior in the year. So the fourth quarter was a little bit light.  I do think you're going to see a significant uptick in our equity-based comp next year in 2023, both -- we've made some big grants in February, just a number of our key people and to ensure retention and make sure to reward people that have performed really well and then also bringing on Harvey, and that will also have an increase in our equity-based comp in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: Great. So realizations have been pretty resilient despite the tough backdrop I'm curious what parts of your portfolio are you most active monetizing today? And then it might be tough to answer, but what's the base case expectation for realizations in 2023, assuming no material shift in the backdrop? Do you think you can get back to that $1 billion level again?\nCurtis Buser: So Brian, it's a great question. And I always like policy my crystal ball to fine-tune this as best I can. A year ago, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we earned about $700 million in net realized carry off of a very strong realization period. And that was like not only impossible to forecast and predict until kind of as it was happening, it also shows the power of what can occur in a single quarter. So we're sitting here today with $4 billion of net accrued carry on the balance sheet. Our underlying portfolio of $138 billion of fair value is up 10% from a year ago. So the portfolio is incredibly well positioned to continue to drive significant realizations for our LPs and carried interest for us. Now exact timing of that, look, it's going to be second half of the year. Now good news is there's some smaller, midsized transactions occurring as we speak that gives me a lot of confidence. But the big stuff that will really drive it will be more in the back half of the year. And keep in mind, you actually sign up a transaction, and it takes often a couple of quarters to actually close the transaction. And so the level of announced transaction is far lower today than say, a year ago. And so therefore, it's going to be the back half of the year.\nKenneth Worthington: Helpful. And then just with respect to CP VII, gross returns of the fund total 14% or 8% on a net basis. So how are you thinking about returns for this fund as it continues to mature over time? And then if you look back historically, what's the average markup on realized investments relative to the prior unrealized marks?\nCurtis Buser: So I would be very careful in terms of -- we have funds that are in fundraising. To talking about specifics and forward stuff is complicated on a call like this. But let me give you some high-level thinking. First, our current generation of buyout funds are generally in the same position as their predecessor funds, which all did exceptionally well. And really, I'm optimistic in terms of where this fund and the similar vintage funds will continue to perform and do, just as I said, with respect to carry.  So I think we're well set up for this. And keep in mind, our portfolio construction, whether it's in private equity or real estate or credit, is very diversified. And we tend to invest in good assets where we have deep industry experience and knowledge, where we understand the macro environment where they're operating in. And most of our value creation comes from driving revenue and driving earnings. It's generally not, hey, we figure out how to buy low sell high. It's generally not kind of -- boy, we can turn this business around because we're smarter than everybody else. We bring tools to add to revenue, add to profitability, and that's what it turns in the success.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rufus Hone with BMO.\nRufus Hone: I wanted to come back to some of the comments you made around the FRE growth trajectory. I guess could you give us a better sense of when you anticipate getting into the double-digit growth rate you mentioned in the prepared remarks. And do you think you can get to double digits organically? Or is that dependent on inorganic growth?\nCurtis Buser: Rufus, thanks. Look, we can definitely get double-digit organically where -- the business is growing fast and it's very possible that we'll get there in '23, but I would say, it's on the lower side of that, and it really depends upon activity levels. Transaction fees can be a big help. Transaction fees, essentially, if you look on detail while 2022 was up over '21 and was our best year ever on transaction fee revenues. And from Q2, it kind of peaked and came down in Q3 and came down in Q4, which put a downward pressure on fee-related earnings. I think they're -- it's going to remain like in the first quarter or so. And then as they pick back up, that will be a big help. In addition, there's a number of things that we think will also turn on later in the year. And keep in mind, our credit business generally generates fees off of invested capital. So as we raise capital in that business and raised a lot of money in 2022, as it deploys, we get the benefit of that. And so there's a built-in lag between fundraising and fee generation, in particular, in that business. So hopefully, that gives you some color.\nDaniel Harris: And I would just add, Rufus, as we said during our remarks, we continue to invest in new product development and distribution. And that's across the platform and we noted that, that's in the private wealth channel as well. So those are things that should help us drive organic new growth over time in addition to, of course, inorganic opportunities that show up and all the things that Curt just mentioned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And we just want to congratulate you on naming a top-notch CEO.\nWilliam Conway: Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we wanted to start with an update on fundraising for the flagship PE funds starting with CPA. I think there are a number of large LPs that wanted to wait until 2023 when their annual deployment allocations were reset before they committed to 8. I just want to see how this is playing out now that we're more than a month into 2023?\nCurtis Buser: Craig, it's really too early and I really don't like to talk about details on a given fund, but remain optimistic in terms of where all of our fundraising can turn out. And as we said, I think we're going to raise more money this year than we did last year.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. And just as my follow-up. A big question for us is the long-term growth trajectory. And I know there's not a ton you can say on this, but when you wrap up your fundraising super cycle with Asia 6 and Europe 6 this year and start to exit the cycle, can you talk about the potential for FRE growth to decelerate and help us kind of with this risk really framing into '24? And I think it really comes down to the dynamic of can you raise enough capital in insurance solutions and credit to offset the net realizations that your private business will generate?\nCurtis Buser: So Craig, I am very optimistic. Let's just start with solutions. Solutions pre '21 or so was -- for 5 years, was averaging about $30 million or so in fee-related earnings, had a very successful fundraise and growth in that business and stair-stepped up essentially doubled initially to $80 million. We're now in the $70 million or $69 million in '22 for fee-related earnings. It does everything that I'm expecting it to do. I see it doubling again. It won't double in '23, but I think, in '24, that business can double.  We're very bullish on what our credit business can do. And we think with both product that we can really drive, hopefully, another doubling of that business won't be again in '23. It's going to take us some time. But we really kind of think that we can kind of make some real progress there. And that's off the back of continuing to build out our capital markets business, which, by the way, I had zero exposure on my balance sheet in terms of hung deals or bad things. So really, really proud of our team and capital markets in terms of how they've operated and operated in a very smart way.  We talked about Fortitude and what it can do. And look, just the strength across the rest of the structured credit as well as a number of new products. And don't forget our opportunistic credit business, which is very bullish and is going strong. So there's a lot of great things in credit and in private equity. Look -- still remain interested in kind of what we can do outside of traditional buyout, which -- look, I actually think our buyout business is amongst one of the best. And with a little bit of good news in some places, we'll be right back to kind of doing what it's always done and think that we're well set up for real progress there.  And then you just think real estate has just a phenomenal track record. It can add to the picture and see much further growth in real estate. It's too early to really call out kind of what can happen in energy. And -- but I think in infrastructure, you got a nice upside lift kind of there. It will take some time, but it's a nice upside lift. And so I think across the platform, lots of great things and looking forward to what we can collectively do as a team going forward.\nDaniel Harris: Craig, I think as you referenced the term super cycle, as we've continued to pursue this diversification strategy we've been on for quite some time, that term has less and less meaning for us. Yes, we raised closed-end funds. But if you look at the number of significantly large funds across our platform in every different business, we're going to raise significant amounts of capital in every year. And then you add on all the things that Curt mentioned outside of what we had several years ago, whether that's Fortitude or opportunistic credit or open-ended products. And we see opportunities to raise a lot of capital, which gives us conviction and confidence that we're going to be able to grow FRE in a very substantial way over time.  And just to reiterate what we said during our prepared remarks, we've grown FRE at 34% CAGR over the past 5 years, and that's not an accident. It's because of this process. And as we look forward, we're very hopeful, and we have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to deliver great results too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just circling back to some of the fundraising commentary just as you guys are out on the road meeting with LPs. I was hoping you might be able to comment on pricing trends. To what extent have fees and pricing come up in your discussions with LPs? How are overall economics evolving on the newer slate of funds relative to the predecessor funds? When you look across management fees, discounts for size, recycling provisions, step-downs, reimbursement for expenses, all of those sort of pieces, what sort of changes, if any, are you seeing in the marketplace?\nCurtis Buser: Michael, it's Curt. I don't think that we're seeing anything significant one way or the other as we are on the road talking to people. It's -- the stuff that was always kind of the case still remains the case, which is access to co-investment and the like. And so that's really where more of the discussions really go as we're talking to LPs and fundraising.\nMichael Cyprys: And maybe just a follow-up to that, maybe more on the portfolio company side, just around performance, revenue, EBITDA growth trends. Maybe you can just give a little bit of commentary there. What are you seeing, margin trends, inflationary pressures, tight labor conditions? How is the portfolio adapting to the sort of backdrop? And if you're able to quantify any of that, that would be helpful, too.\nCurtis Buser: Look, the portfolio grew really nicely first half of the year, in particular. The rate of growth decreased second half of the year but was still growing. So over '22 EBITDA was growing, I want to say, on average about 10%, particularly over the Corporate Private Equity, broadly speaking, portfolio. And so optimistic around kind of what that can continue to do.  Across many of the businesses, we saw continued pricing power that enabled that to occur, to be seen in terms of how strong that pricing power continues and kind of inflationary pressure and how that works against us. And then -- but the good news is, I will say that the way we've constructed the portfolios, we're generally in good shape. So again, cash flowing businesses, real estate is not in the bad areas. So almost nothing in office or hotel or retail. So again, very good construction across both our private equity, inclusive of real estate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: We've covered a fair amount of ground here this morning. But maybe just kind of touching base on the expense side and clearly saw a pretty meaningful step-up in G&A year-over-year. Obviously, a lot of growth initiatives going on investing in the business. But perhaps, Curt, if you could give us a little sense of how to think about that as we look to the next 12 to 24 months?\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Gerry, for the question, and good to hear from you. Look, in a year where I can grow FRE 40% over the prior year, I'll take it however I can get it. And if that means investing in the business, that's a great outcome to generate 40% FRE margin. With respect to cash and with respect to G&A, if you look at it on a quarterly basis, Q4 versus Q4, pretty much flat. Yes, on an annual basis up. But I actually think that we're very focused on -- I know that we're very focused on managing costs and managing where we deploy our excess expenditures, and it's really around investing in new product development, in distribution and investing for the future.  There are clearly things that we're making investments in that will benefit us '24, '25, '26 to enable long-term growth, and things like retail and private wealth really matter for that, less so in terms of what it does to '23 FRE.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Most of my questions have been asked and answered as well. But I just want to come back to the -- actually to Investor Day targets that you laid out in '21. You're tracking ahead of those targets already with the exception of FRE, which I guess you're on the way towards given its 40% target for 2024. But just wanted to get your conviction around reaching that level? Or is that going to be more of a Harvey decision in terms of potential new investments that you might be making and rather -- you'd rather just focus, like you said, on FRE growth?\nCurtis Buser: Brian, good question. And look, I'm incredibly proud of what Carlyle and the entire team has achieved '21, '22 because we set out a target of $1.6 billion for '24, $800 million of FRE, $800 million of carry for $1.6 billion of pretax fee. We've swapped that from an outcome perspective already in '21 and in '22. So FRE at $834 million this past year, 40% up, I care much more about FRE dollars and growth in FRE dollars than I care about margins.  Look, margin is a tool to generate FRE dollars. And so whatever we can do to create more dollars, one tool is creating -- is by margin. But however, I can get it, I'm going to get it. And you're right, we set a target of 40% of FRE margin by 2024. '23, I think, will probably be more on the flattish size to '22, which will then cause pressure for '24 to get to that number. I still think we can do it. Look, we grew from 33% to 37%, '21 to '22. So there's no reason we can't do that in '23 to '24, but time will tell. And look, again, it's about growing FRE dollars. And so if I can get the FRE dollars going in the right way, that's what I'm going to do.\nBrian Bedell: That's loud and clear. And then maybe just one last one. Just I guess you talked a lot about fundraising and the headwinds obviously on the private equity side. Maybe if you could just characterize what you're hearing from LPs and other investors in terms of -- now having Harvey on Board and how much of a ballast that is to confidence in the franchise? Or was that not so much of a headwind anyway, it was really just the headwinds in the overall industry and less related to your -- to the leadership?\nWilliam Conway: This is Bill. In my discussions with the investors, and I was in Europe and I was in Asia and Japan. I would say, that I didn't see anybody who didn't invest with us because I was the Interim CEO, and we didn't have a permanent CEO, and Harvey hadn't been named at that time. There were perhaps some people who delayed and want to think about the decision and wanted to know who it's going to be before they committed. But I don't think there was any -- I couldn't point to any investors said they didn't do it because we didn't have the CEO. I think they may have -- they didn't do it now because we didn't have the CEO, and we'll see what happens when the CEO is named.  I do think a far bigger factor than the CEO is the market. And the CEO is -- most of the fund investors, they care much, much more about the performance of their fund and the individual deals than they care about who the CEO is. So although I'm very excited about Harvey, and I think he's going to be fabulous, the market, I think, is a more important factor in terms of growth in the PE fundraising.\nOperator: Next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: Just one question. It's got 3 parts about the fundraising environment, not necessarily fund specific, but just kind of what you're seeing. Number one, you mentioned LP liquidity needs. So I'm curious what's driving those, whether it's slower monetization or tighter financing or something else? Number two, big theme last year was denominator effect. How far along are LPs in terms of realigning around that and kind of getting past that? And number three is the reopening of LP budgets with the New Year, is it similar to what you've seen in past years or better or worse?\nCurtis Buser: Adam, it's Curt. I'll start and then Bill can add in. Look, it's always difficult to generalize these types of questions across all the different investor classes and everyone. So everyone just take that caveat very seriously as I attempt to address some of this. LP liquidity needs in general were really due to the fact that a number of funds invested and deployed capital very quickly across the industry and have come back for greater needs faster than expectations. And then with the slowing down of the equity capital markets in particular, just as we're talking about buyout in general, that has put some liquidity needs on some investors, not necessarily all. I mean, there are parts of the world, Middle East, in particular, where I don't think that those needs are as apparent as in other places.  On the denominator effect, look, there were some green shoots early in the year in terms of potential changes with that, some resetting. I think that, that will get better over the course of the year. But again, it comes back to each individual investor type and how they're viewing it. And so I think that, that will play out. And also, again, all investors are going to be seeking yield. And I think alternative assets is a great place to seek yield. This industry has proven well and it's just generally done better. And so it's more about getting them all access to this.  And then the new year, yes, that has an impact on, again, certain LPs in their allocations and how they work with their own investment committees. And yes, it is an impact for some. But again, in terms of quantifying on a broader basis, really tough to kind of do. So I don't know if Bill is going to add anything?\nWilliam Conway: Well, I would say, I can't break it down by category in terms of what the impact is going to be. I think it's going to be better than it was last year. I do think that the LP liquidity creates an opportunity for Carlyle. We have a big solutions business of about $70 billion. And both in secondaries, primaries, co-investment, I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity there, perhaps in some ways, offsetting some of the primary opportunity as LPs either reposition their portfolio or need liquidity for some reason, as Curt pointed out, not so much in some parts of the world, but in others.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Daniel Harris for ready for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you all for your time and interest this morning. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, feel free to reach out to Investor Relations at any time. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Conway",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be on the call to discuss Carlyle's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results. As you've heard, Carlyle delivered strong results to our stakeholders despite the challenging market environment. The firm is operating well, and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to capture investment opportunities and to continue to grow our platform in 2023.  I want to talk about 3 topics this morning: the outcome of our CEO selection, the strong financial performance of Carlyle in 2022 and some general thoughts on our outlook. First, we are incredibly pleased that Harvey Schwartz will join Carlyle as the new CEO on February 15. As you all know, this was an incredibly important decision for Carlyle. And the search committee of the Board, on which I serve, drove a robust and exhaustive search for a new CEO. Following a thorough and competitive process, Harvey was unanimously chosen by the Board as the right leader to move Carlyle forward in its next phase of growth.  Harvey is a widely respected business builder with significant leadership experience in a high-performing, highly competitive global financial institution. He is a seasoned operator with a proven record of leading and developing a wide range of businesses and a demonstrated ability to invest in and develop the talent and organizational structure to manage and support these businesses.  As we look to the future, there is tremendous opportunity to grow and to continue to perform Carlyle, to transform Carlyle and deliver sustainable results over the long term. Harvey brings the experience and skill set to fully capture this opportunity.  As CEO, he will set and execute a strategy that advances and accelerates the diversification plan the firm has successfully pursued as well as identify new investment opportunities to further scale the business, drive performance and deliver growth. I am confident in Harvey's leadership and look forward to introducing him to you in the very near future.  Moving on, I'd like to discuss our 2022 results. Curt will dive into our results in more detail, but I wanted to touch on a few notable points. As Dan mentioned, we generated record fee-related earnings of $834 million in 2022, an increase of 40% over 2021, which demonstrates that our strategic focus to grow FRE and diversify our earnings mix is paying off, and we earned $1.9 billion in distributable earnings despite a volatile exit environment.  We delivered investment returns that were attractive across our portfolio. Our aggregate carry fund portfolio appreciated 11% in the year, while the public markets were down about 20%. And as I said last quarter, portfolio construction and risk management matter, and we believe that this is the key differentiator that positions our investment teams to deliver superior relative performance across market cycles.  Turning to our outlook. As we enter 2023, we are confident in the strong foundation of the firm and believe that we are well positioned to capture new growth opportunities, and Harvey will focus on building off this strong foundation. At its core, our business involves raising money and investing money and then making money that we've invested worth more.  Let me begin with some thoughts on fundraising. No doubt the backdrop for raising new capital remains challenging with headwinds more pronounced in certain areas than others. However, today's environment is different from what we faced entering 2022. Early last year, an unexpected and sharp change in market sentiment had investors on their back foot for most of the year. With rapidly deteriorating public equity and debt prices, the denominator effect greatly reduced LP interest and ability to make new commitments.  Over the past few months, at least until last week, we've seen a gradual reduction in market volatility. Investors still believe that they have a better handle on the magnitude of further interest rate changes. In addition, Carlyle's longstanding relationships with the largest and most sophisticated investors around the globe is a benefit, and we continue to see strong demand for many of our investment strategies across our 3 global segments.  Our platform has continued to diversify, and it's important to note that roughly 2/3 of our fundraising last year came from areas such as Global Credit, Global Investment Solutions, natural resources and real estate. While corporate private equity may continue to face headwinds, we see significant capital raising opportunities across our platform. We will have more strategies raising capital in 2023 than we did in 2022, including our next vintage flagship funds and credit opportunities, secondaries, co-investments and buyout funds across the globe.  We anticipate that our overall dollar volume of fundraising in 2023 will be higher than the $30 billion we raised in 2022. Over the past few months, I've been around the world speaking with our teams and investors and feel confident in the power of our platform. Our investors value our partnership, our global reach and our ability to construct diverse portfolios that perform across market cycles.  Now that Harvey is here, it has also taken away some uncertainty about our path forward as a firm, and we think that will also have a positive impact on fundraising. Regarding capital development, today's market conditions create new opportunities to invest capital across all of our global businesses. Recently, there's been a wider-than-average spread in pricing expectations between buyers and sellers, which has impacted capital development. The spread is across most asset classes that has been more pronounced in private equity than other strategies, and we are -- but we are starting to see evidence of this spread narrowing. As debt and equity capital markets continue to reopen, the pace of deal activity is poised to accelerate.  We deployed a record $35 billion in capital in 2022 with a good balance across equity, credit and solution strategies. And we are well positioned for further investment with $72 billion in dry powder to capitalize on an improving environment. We expect to find ample opportunities to make new investments in 2023 and beyond on behalf of our fund investors. In addition, the improving deal environment presents an opportunity for our global credit business to provide unique capital solutions to the marketplace. In 2022, we underwrote $3.9 billion of new loan activity in our direct lending strategy, and our CLO team issued 9 new CLOs while also trading $30 billion across their portfolios to better position the CLOs for the expected economic environment.  And as fund investors' need for liquidity persists, we are well positioned to capitalize on this need to our secondaries and co-investments business. Overall, 2022 was a solid year across most financial metrics for Carlyle, and we entered 2023 with strength and momentum. With Harvey as our new CEO alongside our strong leadership team, Carlyle is well positioned and we're confident that he will build on this momentum to bolster the firm's position and create value for all our investors and shareholders.  With that, let me hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser, to discuss our financial results in more detail. Sure. And thank you for the question, Glenn. First of all, I am very excited that Harvey is going to join us. He was our first choice, and he is -- and I think it should be pretty obvious why. We were looking for somebody who had a really proven track record. We were looking for somebody who had experience building businesses. We were looking for somebody who had a record of managing and recruiting and training and developing talent and working in the collaborative environment. We were looking for somebody who could relate to people like you in Wall Street and tell our story, a wide range of skills. And frankly, there aren't a lot of people who have all those skills.  In Harvey, I think we found that person. He is really fantastic. Yesterday, he and I were walking around our New York office. We went on all the floors, we were talking to people, and he was happy to see them, and they were happy to see him. And it was really not so much they want to get rid of me, but rather they were excited to see him there. We obviously have a lot of people who used to work for Goldman, and they were happy to see him; and people who just had heard about him and his track record and his skill set.  So I think why Harvey and who he is and what his track record is, that was pretty clear to me that we couldn't get anybody any better than Harvey. He was -- he's fantastic. Now what's he here to do? I think in some ways, the path that we have is set. We want to -- first of all, we want to increase the stock price. Even though we are -- we've got a great investment track record that doesn't show up in our stock price, we have -- how is he going to do that? Well, we have to grow our business, we have to grow our business, we have to grow our business. Particularly the fee-related earnings, but other parts of the business as well that assets and the like, he's got a great set of experiences. Remember, he was at Goldman during the time of a financial crisis and talking about having to deal with situations that were risky and yet had great opportunity. So I don't see dramatic changes in the basic strategy, but it will be up to Harvey. He's going to be the CEO of the company. And I'm going to do everything I can to help him be successful and -- including staying out of his way, if that's the right part of the solution. I can't tell you how happy I am that he's here. That is -- that the real question is. And of course, what we're talking about there is that sellers think their businesses were worth what they were worth a year or 2 ago. And buyers say, \"Well, I don't want to pay those prices anymore.\" And so there's been a gap. I've mentioned in my remarks that it's been both in the prices of equities, we see it kind of on the value of the companies that you own, but it also applies to credit. For example, there was a deal recently and we looked at where the credit spread or all in price of the credit a year ago might have been 6% or 6.5%, and now it's double digits. So there are still certainly some disparities in valuation.  However, it is getting better, Glenn. And I'd say it's getting better slowly. It's not rapidly. This is not going to be something that I think it -- someone is going to ring the buzz and we're going to know that it's where it should be. Private equity has the advantage and private debt too as well of being able to evolve and able to function in lots of different kinds of environments and to adjust to those environments. And I see that in the types of deals that we do now. We're not doing deals that are giant deals that require billions -- $10 billion of equity and $10 billion of credit. Those deals will be almost impossible to do today.  But the market is gradually healing. Buyers and sellers gradually coming together. And I think it's on both sides. I think buyers are dropping the prices down and I think -- price what they're willing to pay. And the sellers are saying, well, maybe we're going to have to just be able to settle for a lower price than we thought. And I think that's across the board. It's not going to be just in private equity, it's not going to be just in Americas, it's everywhere. More in the second half probably than the first. Okay. And just a follow-up, maybe stick with you, Curt. So just sort of triangulating the notion of FRE up in '23 over '22, just sort of wondering how you might be able to ring-fence that. And then just given the sort of yet to be determined incremental strategy with Mr. Schwartz, how should we think about margins? Because I hear a lot of grow the business, grow the business, grow the business. Can you drive FRE up and FRE margins up if you still need to grow the business? Yes. I think solution is going to be a big growing fund and the funds of solutions are going to be a pretty big growing area this year. I also -- I don't want to confine Harvey in any way. I don't want my comments in any way to limit his ability to imagine a different future or a different way that things could be done better. So I'm a little hesitant to get too specific on this. But I do think that the noncorporate private equity funds, the demand is there, too.  I used that credit example before when I was answering a prior question. Sometimes when it's a little tougher to raise the equity, raising the credit funds is a little easier because the opportunity is great, the spreads are wider and more money can be made by the investors in those funds. But I don't want to confine my answer in any way that will limit Harvey and his ability to do a great job. Thank you. You know Harvey? Do you know Harvey? Okay. Good. I just -- I didn't know whether or not another Goldman Sachs person might weigh in and what a great guy he is. I'd also tell you that Fortitude has -- we have 4 or 5 institutional partners who are in that business and are fellow shareholders with us in Fortitude. And they have been fabulous partners helping us grow that business. For us, it still is -- we got a lot of capital invested, but we have less than we otherwise would, thanks to those great partners we have. And as Curt said, we do expect to double that business over the next few years at least. No more specifics to give at this time, Curt. Sorry. And I think its returns are pretty uncorrelated with all the other returns available in the market, too, and that appeals to a certain group of investors as well. Thank you. This is Bill. In my discussions with the investors, and I was in Europe and I was in Asia and Japan. I would say, that I didn't see anybody who didn't invest with us because I was the Interim CEO, and we didn't have a permanent CEO, and Harvey hadn't been named at that time. There were perhaps some people who delayed and want to think about the decision and wanted to know who it's going to be before they committed. But I don't think there was any -- I couldn't point to any investors said they didn't do it because we didn't have the CEO. I think they may have -- they didn't do it now because we didn't have the CEO, and we'll see what happens when the CEO is named.  I do think a far bigger factor than the CEO is the market. And the CEO is -- most of the fund investors, they care much, much more about the performance of their fund and the individual deals than they care about who the CEO is. So although I'm very excited about Harvey, and I think he's going to be fabulous, the market, I think, is a more important factor in terms of growth in the PE fundraising. Well, I would say, I can't break it down by category in terms of what the impact is going to be. I think it's going to be better than it was last year. I do think that the LP liquidity creates an opportunity for Carlyle. We have a big solutions business of about $70 billion. And both in secondaries, primaries, co-investment, I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity there, perhaps in some ways, offsetting some of the primary opportunity as LPs either reposition their portfolio or need liquidity for some reason, as Curt pointed out, not so much in some parts of the world, but in others."

            "name": "Curtis Buser",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by reiterating many things Bill mentioned that emphasize the strong position Carlyle finds itself in as we begin this year. We believe our investment portfolios are in good shape and are well positioned to weather economic volatility. And we expect to deliver long-term attractive performance for all of our stakeholders.  We produced a robust $4.34 per share in distributable earnings in 2022, displaying the significant cash earnings power of our firm. We've now earned over $9 in DE per share in just the past 2 years. We remain focused on growing fee-related earnings, and it grew by 40% in 2022. And over the past 5 years, our FRE CAGR has been a robust 34%. Our overall earnings mix continues to diversify as we have grown our credit, insurance, capital markets and solutions capabilities. Our strong growth in fee-related earnings is not driven by a single fund or strategy. Rather, our performance led us to driving broad-based top line fee growth across our global platform.  Top line fee revenue growth was 25% in 2022 and was driven by the following: first, raising capital for and growing our traditional high-performing investment strategies across each segment -- each of our 3 global segments. Second, organically building out new fee-generating businesses like opportunistic credit, insurance, capital markets and infrastructure credit, to name just a few, each of which added significantly to our growing fee revenue pool throughout the year. And third, we have been actively adding new inorganic streams of earnings, such as our transactions to further scale our CLO business with CBAM, and our advisory agreement with Fortitude.  These efforts have scaled our platform and helped drop more of our top line revenues to the bottom line as we expanded our full year FRE margin to 37% in 2022, an increase of nearly 400 basis points compared to 2021. FRE margin has more than doubled over the past 5 years. We have done this while concurrently investing in new product development and enhanced distribution capabilities, notably across the private wealth channel. We expect to continue to grow FRE in 2023. FRE in the first quarter will likely be similar to Q4 of 2022 before increasing in the second half of the year. In addition, we remain highly confident in our ability to grow FRE well into the double-digit range over the mid- to longer term, in line or better than the market trends across the private capital industry.  Consistent growth in fee-related earnings is supported by the attractive investment returns we produce for our fund investors. Our investment teams again delivered appreciation that outperformed public benchmarks even with increasingly higher discount and cap rate assumptions in our valuation models and elevated concerns about global recession. While only 6% of our carry fund portfolio was publicly traded at year-end, public market comparables are an important input to our valuation methodology and generally were a downward driver of valuations across our private assets during the year.  Of course, the most important valuation driver of any investment is underlying asset level performance, which, in general, continued to reflect growth in revenues and earnings, though this growth generally slowed in the second half of 2022. Our strong performance also owes to our focus on deploying capital in the sectors where we have deep industry expertise and experience.  Our real estate funds appreciated 16% during 2022. Our Infrastructure & Natural Resource funds appreciated a very strong 48%, and Corporate Private Equity funds were up 6%. We realized $34 billion in proceeds for the year, which produced another year with $1 billion in net realized performance revenue. About what I previously indicated would be a good target in most years.  Looking forward, net accrued carry increased 2% year-over-year to $4 billion. A solid portfolio appreciation more than offset strong carry realizations. And we ended the year with $138 billion in fair value in our carry funds, up more than 10% compared to year-end 2021. In general, we continue to expect to generate on average $1 billion in annual net realized carry.  Though depending on the year, realized performance income could be elevated as it was in 2021 when market factors were favorable or lower in years where uncertainty diminishes capital markets activity. Industry-wide activity rates slowed considerably in the past few months as buyers and sellers continue to search for evaluation middle ground, and funding markets while available are less amenable than they were just a year ago.  For Carlyle specifically, new investment and realization activity has also been slower. And so we expect a muted start to 2023 for both deployment and realizations. Thus, transaction revenue and realized performance income will be lower over the next quarter or 2. If our activity rates across the industry improve over the next few months, then our expectations for higher performance and transaction revenues will also increase.  Let me now turn to some quick thoughts on each of the business segments. Global Private Equity had another strong year with fee-related earnings up 34%. Strong appreciation across Real Estate, Infrastructure and Natural Resources helped net accrued carry increase to $3.5 billion after more than $900 million of net carry realizations. $20 billion of invested capital was generally similar to $23 billion of realized proceeds, which positions global private equity to continue to deliver attractive levels of distributable earnings in future periods.  Global Credit remains our fastest-growing segment, and it benefited from both organic growth activity as well as the positive impact from strategic transactions. Top line fee revenues grew 46% in 2022, resulted in fee-related earnings more than doubling to $225 million, and fee-related earnings margins increasing by nearly 1,000 basis points to 37%.  Strong investment performance across various strategies produced $70 million of net realized performance revenue. Our credit interval fund delivered attractive performance with a 10% dividend yield, while continued net inflows grew managed assets to more than $2 billion. We raised $15 billion in new capital across 11 strategies in Global Credit in 2022, and we expect to have an active year fundraising for additional strategies in 2023, which should position Global Credit for further growth. In addition, we remain focused on helping Fortitude evaluate new growth opportunities, which would help us benefit from incremental advisory revenues.  And in Global Investment Solutions, we are well positioned to see growth in this segment as we begin fundraising for our flagship products, including next vintages in our co-investment and secondary strategies. Fee-related earnings of $69 million in 2022 was lower than 2021, but we expect to see growth later in 2023, as these strategies attract new capital. In addition, with $374 million in net accrued carry and very strong fund performance, performance-related revenues are well positioned to increase over time.  In sum, we delivered strong performance for our stakeholders in 2022 and are well positioned for what will likely be a more attractive investment environment in 2023. We see tremendous opportunity to deploy capital into what we think will be a great investment for our portfolio and fund investors. Now let me turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions. Bill, it's Curt. Thanks for your question. I'll start and then Bill might add in. So I'm really proud of what we did in 2022 from a deployment standpoint. We deployed $35 billion across the portfolio. It was actually our most deployment in any year. And between '22 and '23, it was noticeably better than what it had been in all prior years. Bill talked about some of the challenges here recently, and we think that, that's going to pick back up.  The diversification across the platform and deployment I was really proud of because what you saw in '23 was much more coming out of Global Credit and other aspects of even private equity outside of corporate private equity. And so all of that was really good. So the deployment piece was really good. That leads us into a good place from a fundraising perspective and sets us up well for fundraising.  And so because it's the first and foremost thing, I think, is kind of how the portfolios are performing and then how you think about fundraising. So from a fundraising standpoint, a couple of high-level things for you to keep in mind. Our portfolios are performing really well. And this, I think, sets us up nicely to go as we seek to raise more capital.  Second, as Bill said, we expect to raise more in 2023 than we did in 2022, and we'll have more products in the market to support this. The third thing from a number standpoint, I want you to keep in mind is, in 2021, at the beginning of the year, we said we would raise $130-plus billion over 4 years. So 2 years in, we've raised $80 billion, $50 billion last year, $30 billion this year. And we added $65 billion through strategic transactions. So that's $145 billion of new fee-earning AUM in just 2 years. And you see that in our fee-related earnings, up 40%, 30-plus CAGR over the last 5 years. And so that's done really well. And we've seen a lot of that growth really in credit and in our solutions business. Now in the buyout funds, we still have, obviously, some congestion in that space, but there's a number of reasons to have optimism there. First, as Bill said, I think there's less uncertainty about the global markets today than it was a year ago. Second, public markets seem to be improving here in early days of the year, but it's still early. Third, we're in '23. So that's a new set of allocations for investors. And last, with the appointment of Harvey Schwartz, we have a lot of reason to be excited. And we hope that, that carries forward to our investors and taking away some uncertainty that may linger there in certain situations.  But look, I'll reiterate that I think that our buyout funds will be similar in size to their previous vintages. And so I'm confident in that and very excited about kind of our overall growth in the firm. And I think that this will be a better year from a fundraising perspective than it was in 2022 and, again, helping us in our focus on driving fee-related earnings. Bill, look, I said that we're confident we're going to grow fee-related earnings in '23. I think the first quarter will be a little flat, as I said in my remarks. But thereafter, I think things are really set up nicely. There's -- this is a challenging environment, and we are continuing to invest and that's why I think this might be a little lower rate of total growth than, say, in the past, but feeling really good about our ability to grow fee-related earnings. I think with Harvey coming on, his past experience in helping companies and helping situations improve profitability will be a good addition to the team, will bring new thoughts to this. But I also want to be careful and give him the opportunity to put his imprint on things. And so I want to be a little cautious in terms of how much specificity I give in guidance, but we're really well set up to begin '23. Alex, it's Curt. Let me start and then Bill can add. So look, credit did about $15 billion this past year. It's going to have more product in the market than last, feeling really good about how that continues. Our opportunistic credit fund is out there raising money. Our CLO business will probably start the year a little slower because of all the reasons we've talked about. But I think it's always a heavy weight in the room.  And then in the solutions business, we've got our co-investment products and our secondaries products and a couple of new things that we'll bring to market this year. And so again, more products in that space. Think of the solutions business as really being a nice way to kind of really increase from where they were in 2022. And then in private equity, look, we're going to have more product in the market in private equity. So a number of buyout funds, U.S., Europe, Asia, will either begin or will be in the market from a fundraising perspective. There's other products in private equity that will be in the market. And so that, too, I think, is well positioned to do better. I don't know, Bill, if you have anything to add. Sure, Alex. So look, Fortitude has got $50 billion, $51 billion of AUM. The way we've set up the services arrangement, we fee off of all of that. In addition, they've invested about 9 -- or I should say, committed about $9 billion into our funds. So all of that has been working as planned. They also have about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of excess capital, which positions them nicely to continue to grow, very active pipeline, working really hard on that.  We've said before that we fully expect that to be -- for them to be able to double in size because of that and fully expect that, that will occur. And when we have more to be able to say on those fronts, we'll be sure to mention that to you. But we remain very optimistic about kind of how Fortitude can continue to benefit Carlyle. Patrick, let me start on this, but I'm always sensitive about trying to read into the minds of others or really try to figure this out in detail. Look, we have great relations with our LP investors. I think they're pleased with what we're doing. A lot of our portfolio performance has been just fantastic and well constructed. And as I already went through a litany of things in terms of what we've done well, $145 billion of capital formation in the past 2 years, I think that we can continue to do that in terms of growing and looking, we'll continue to look at organic things.  So look, I think the tone is good, but it's still difficult in different places. And tone, you got to be specific related to kind of individual situations in the given fund and the like. And there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic as we start '23. So Bill, I don't know if you have anything to add to that? Ken, well said. I mean, I do think that we're optimistic on the energy platforms. Our partners and colleagues at NGP are excited about their opportunities. They've got a fund in the market now. I don't want to comment specifically on that, but expecting good things out of that. Our renewables platform, our power business, our international energy platform all give us a number of products, but they're not all in the market. But you're right. Right now, there's a lot of good opportunity in energy, but different LPs based on their constituencies have different perspectives.  The limited experience that we have is that generally, we're seeing a nice uptick from the existing investors in existing product, which is different than kind of going after new or different, but it's a good opportunity at the present time. Look, the needs are really significant. I think a lot of that has played out. And so it's too early, Ken, to really call that definitively. But look, I feel a whole heck of a lot better about that whole sector than say, 2 years ago where it felt a lot more difficult. Right now, everything, performance and the chance forward on a lot of those different aspects, I think, are really, really good. Yes. That's -- look, like a lot of things in this business, looking at any individual quarter is a mistake. You got to look at it over a longer period of time. The fourth quarter had some unusual things in it. Essentially, our fourth quarter is always a little bit light because you've completed a vesting of a big tranche in the third quarter. And you haven't granted anything new that occurs in February. So the fourth quarter is naturally a low quarter, plus we had some performance units for some senior folks that didn't fully there that had been accrued prior in the year. So the fourth quarter was a little bit light.  I do think you're going to see a significant uptick in our equity-based comp next year in 2023, both -- we've made some big grants in February, just a number of our key people and to ensure retention and make sure to reward people that have performed really well and then also bringing on Harvey, and that will also have an increase in our equity-based comp in 2023. So Brian, it's a great question. And I always like policy my crystal ball to fine-tune this as best I can. A year ago, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we earned about $700 million in net realized carry off of a very strong realization period. And that was like not only impossible to forecast and predict until kind of as it was happening, it also shows the power of what can occur in a single quarter. So we're sitting here today with $4 billion of net accrued carry on the balance sheet. Our underlying portfolio of $138 billion of fair value is up 10% from a year ago. So the portfolio is incredibly well positioned to continue to drive significant realizations for our LPs and carried interest for us. Now exact timing of that, look, it's going to be second half of the year. Now good news is there's some smaller, midsized transactions occurring as we speak that gives me a lot of confidence. But the big stuff that will really drive it will be more in the back half of the year. And keep in mind, you actually sign up a transaction, and it takes often a couple of quarters to actually close the transaction. And so the level of announced transaction is far lower today than say, a year ago. And so therefore, it's going to be the back half of the year. So I would be very careful in terms of -- we have funds that are in fundraising. To talking about specifics and forward stuff is complicated on a call like this. But let me give you some high-level thinking. First, our current generation of buyout funds are generally in the same position as their predecessor funds, which all did exceptionally well. And really, I'm optimistic in terms of where this fund and the similar vintage funds will continue to perform and do, just as I said, with respect to carry.  So I think we're well set up for this. And keep in mind, our portfolio construction, whether it's in private equity or real estate or credit, is very diversified. And we tend to invest in good assets where we have deep industry experience and knowledge, where we understand the macro environment where they're operating in. And most of our value creation comes from driving revenue and driving earnings. It's generally not, hey, we figure out how to buy low sell high. It's generally not kind of -- boy, we can turn this business around because we're smarter than everybody else. We bring tools to add to revenue, add to profitability, and that's what it turns in the success. Rufus, thanks. Look, we can definitely get double-digit organically where -- the business is growing fast and it's very possible that we'll get there in '23, but I would say, it's on the lower side of that, and it really depends upon activity levels. Transaction fees can be a big help. Transaction fees, essentially, if you look on detail while 2022 was up over '21 and was our best year ever on transaction fee revenues. And from Q2, it kind of peaked and came down in Q3 and came down in Q4, which put a downward pressure on fee-related earnings. I think they're -- it's going to remain like in the first quarter or so. And then as they pick back up, that will be a big help. In addition, there's a number of things that we think will also turn on later in the year. And keep in mind, our credit business generally generates fees off of invested capital. So as we raise capital in that business and raised a lot of money in 2022, as it deploys, we get the benefit of that. And so there's a built-in lag between fundraising and fee generation, in particular, in that business. So hopefully, that gives you some color. Craig, it's really too early and I really don't like to talk about details on a given fund, but remain optimistic in terms of where all of our fundraising can turn out. And as we said, I think we're going to raise more money this year than we did last year. So Craig, I am very optimistic. Let's just start with solutions. Solutions pre '21 or so was -- for 5 years, was averaging about $30 million or so in fee-related earnings, had a very successful fundraise and growth in that business and stair-stepped up essentially doubled initially to $80 million. We're now in the $70 million or $69 million in '22 for fee-related earnings. It does everything that I'm expecting it to do. I see it doubling again. It won't double in '23, but I think, in '24, that business can double.  We're very bullish on what our credit business can do. And we think with both product that we can really drive, hopefully, another doubling of that business won't be again in '23. It's going to take us some time. But we really kind of think that we can kind of make some real progress there. And that's off the back of continuing to build out our capital markets business, which, by the way, I had zero exposure on my balance sheet in terms of hung deals or bad things. So really, really proud of our team and capital markets in terms of how they've operated and operated in a very smart way.  We talked about Fortitude and what it can do. And look, just the strength across the rest of the structured credit as well as a number of new products. And don't forget our opportunistic credit business, which is very bullish and is going strong. So there's a lot of great things in credit and in private equity. Look -- still remain interested in kind of what we can do outside of traditional buyout, which -- look, I actually think our buyout business is amongst one of the best. And with a little bit of good news in some places, we'll be right back to kind of doing what it's always done and think that we're well set up for real progress there.  And then you just think real estate has just a phenomenal track record. It can add to the picture and see much further growth in real estate. It's too early to really call out kind of what can happen in energy. And -- but I think in infrastructure, you got a nice upside lift kind of there. It will take some time, but it's a nice upside lift. And so I think across the platform, lots of great things and looking forward to what we can collectively do as a team going forward. Michael, it's Curt. I don't think that we're seeing anything significant one way or the other as we are on the road talking to people. It's -- the stuff that was always kind of the case still remains the case, which is access to co-investment and the like. And so that's really where more of the discussions really go as we're talking to LPs and fundraising. Look, the portfolio grew really nicely first half of the year, in particular. The rate of growth decreased second half of the year but was still growing. So over '22 EBITDA was growing, I want to say, on average about 10%, particularly over the Corporate Private Equity, broadly speaking, portfolio. And so optimistic around kind of what that can continue to do.  Across many of the businesses, we saw continued pricing power that enabled that to occur, to be seen in terms of how strong that pricing power continues and kind of inflationary pressure and how that works against us. And then -- but the good news is, I will say that the way we've constructed the portfolios, we're generally in good shape. So again, cash flowing businesses, real estate is not in the bad areas. So almost nothing in office or hotel or retail. So again, very good construction across both our private equity, inclusive of real estate. Thanks, Gerry, for the question, and good to hear from you. Look, in a year where I can grow FRE 40% over the prior year, I'll take it however I can get it. And if that means investing in the business, that's a great outcome to generate 40% FRE margin. With respect to cash and with respect to G&A, if you look at it on a quarterly basis, Q4 versus Q4, pretty much flat. Yes, on an annual basis up. But I actually think that we're very focused on -- I know that we're very focused on managing costs and managing where we deploy our excess expenditures, and it's really around investing in new product development, in distribution and investing for the future.  There are clearly things that we're making investments in that will benefit us '24, '25, '26 to enable long-term growth, and things like retail and private wealth really matter for that, less so in terms of what it does to '23 FRE. Brian, good question. And look, I'm incredibly proud of what Carlyle and the entire team has achieved '21, '22 because we set out a target of $1.6 billion for '24, $800 million of FRE, $800 million of carry for $1.6 billion of pretax fee. We've swapped that from an outcome perspective already in '21 and in '22. So FRE at $834 million this past year, 40% up, I care much more about FRE dollars and growth in FRE dollars than I care about margins.  Look, margin is a tool to generate FRE dollars. And so whatever we can do to create more dollars, one tool is creating -- is by margin. But however, I can get it, I'm going to get it. And you're right, we set a target of 40% of FRE margin by 2024. '23, I think, will probably be more on the flattish size to '22, which will then cause pressure for '24 to get to that number. I still think we can do it. Look, we grew from 33% to 37%, '21 to '22. So there's no reason we can't do that in '23 to '24, but time will tell. And look, again, it's about growing FRE dollars. And so if I can get the FRE dollars going in the right way, that's what I'm going to do. Adam, it's Curt. I'll start and then Bill can add in. Look, it's always difficult to generalize these types of questions across all the different investor classes and everyone. So everyone just take that caveat very seriously as I attempt to address some of this. LP liquidity needs in general were really due to the fact that a number of funds invested and deployed capital very quickly across the industry and have come back for greater needs faster than expectations. And then with the slowing down of the equity capital markets in particular, just as we're talking about buyout in general, that has put some liquidity needs on some investors, not necessarily all. I mean, there are parts of the world, Middle East, in particular, where I don't think that those needs are as apparent as in other places.  On the denominator effect, look, there were some green shoots early in the year in terms of potential changes with that, some resetting. I think that, that will get better over the course of the year. But again, it comes back to each individual investor type and how they're viewing it. And so I think that, that will play out. And also, again, all investors are going to be seeking yield. And I think alternative assets is a great place to seek yield. This industry has proven well and it's just generally done better. And so it's more about getting them all access to this.  And then the new year, yes, that has an impact on, again, certain LPs in their allocations and how they work with their own investment committees. And yes, it is an impact for some. But again, in terms of quantifying on a broader basis, really tough to kind of do. So I don't know if Bill is going to add anything?"

[Operator Instructions] At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Harris, you may begin, sir.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Harris. Good morning and welcome to Carlyle's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Bill Conway; our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser and several leaders from the office of our CEO. Pete Clare, Chief Investment Officer for Corporate Private Equity; Mark Jenkins, Head of Global Credit; and Ruulke Bagijn Head of Global Investment Solutions. Bill and Curt will begin with some prepared remarks and then the entire call, our team will be available for your Q&A. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have provided reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. I'm going to begin with a quick discussion of our results and then hand the call over to Bill. In the third quarter, we generated $213 million in fee-related earnings and $644 million in distributable earnings. Fee-related earnings of $213 million increased 40% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date FRE is $632 million is 49% higher year-over-year, through a combination of strong organic growth as well as the positive impact of various strategic transactions completed earlier this year. FRE declined sequentially from the second-quarter, largely due to two items we see in the last quarter, catchup management fees totaled $10 million compared to $19 million in the second-quarter and fee related performance revenue was also lower sequentially. Distributable earnings of $644 million this quarter and year-to-date DE of $1.5 billion, is 10% ahead of last year's $1.3 billion and is already more than double any prior full-year results other than our record result from last year. On an after tax basis, we generated $1.42 and DE per share for the third quarter and $3.33 year-to-date. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.325 per common share. With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Bill Conway.\nBill Conway: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. It's been a while since I've spoken with many of you that I'm pleased to be on the call today to discuss Carlyle's results for the quarter. While Carlyle is in a transition period, as we move towards a new CEO, the firm is operating well and I'm proud of our teams around the world as we continue to perform for all of our stakeholders. There are two important points I'd like to focus on today. First, I'll touch on the results and highlight the strength and diversity of Carlyle's global business. Second, as we navigate a challenging markets in a difficult economic environment, I'll discuss how our approach and investment experience, it's helping us manage through economic uncertainty and positioning the firm for the future. I'll also give a brief comment on the status of our search for a permanent CEO. First, let me provide some perspective on Carlyle today. In the third quarter, Carlyle delivered solid results for our fund investors and our shareholders despite the market volatility. And year-to-date, our results are adjusted strong with FRE up almost 50%. None of this is by chance, we were able to deliver this outcome due the breadth and depth of our businesses, strong business leadership and highly capable investment teams around the world. Let me be very clear, the firm's strategic focus on growing fee related earnings, diversifying our business mix and earning stream and improving the way in which we operate has not changed at all. These core tenants will not change regardless of who is leading the firm. We have three global business segments that are run by three strong leaders, each of which serves as stewards of investor capital and drivers of growth for our shareholders. Ruulke Bagijn in Global Investment Solutions, Peter Clare in Global Private Equity and Mark Jenkins in Global Credit are all on the call with me today and you'll have the opportunity to ask them your questions later. As we navigate through more challenging markets than any of us have seen in a decade, the firm is in an enviable position. Carlyle and I have been doing this for 35 years and we've seen all types of markets and economic cycles. We are confident that each of our businesses have the resources, investment talent and capital of over $74 billion of dry powder to capture opportunities for our stakeholders. Our teams are highly experienced and have worked together through various cycles. In fact, the partners of our investment teams have worked together at Carlyle for more than 15 years on average with decades more at firms across the globe. Moving on, let me discuss the broader environment and how that impacts our investment outlook. All of you will see the same things we do. Rising interest rates, high levels of inflation, geopolitical uncertainty. Each of which lead to increased market volatility and headwinds for investors and operators. This is unlikely to resolve in the short-term, now our teams are not sitting back and waiting for better days. Certainly this market is tougher for some parts of our businesses than others and on some parts of our business, this environment will create opportunities. And two examples come to mind, our credit opportunities business, which you see far more lucrative places to put money to work and our solutions business, which will have even more chances at attractive returns to finance buyers and sellers of existing fund positions. One of our core strength has been in the area of investment risk management, particularly in the construction of our portfolios. We certainly take risk, you can't make money without doing so, but we need to get paid-for the risk we take. Until recently, the investors will make the most money have taken the most risk. That is in our style. Portfolio construction matters, it's a differentiator that continues to position our business to deliver outsized relative performance for fund investors across market cycles. Our portfolios are built with diversification by geography, industries, deal size and risk. And portfolio construction isn't adjusted in our private-equity business, but in Global Credit and Global Solutions as well. For instance, in our CLO businesses, CLO portfolios, where we manage hundreds of credits. This investment strategy has led to default rates at half the industry average. Another example would be our US real-estate business, which is investing its ninth closed-end fund with committed capital of $8 billion. This is an experienced team with a long and successful track-record. In terms of portfolio construction, they favor demographics over GDP. Their current fund has almost no exposure to office, hotel and retail, which represents 60% of the typical real-estate fund. In volatile markets like today's, our fund results should reflect the benefits of our strategy and so-far they have. Before I close, let me comment on our search for a permanent CEO. In short, the search continues. The Board and search Committee are making good progress finding the right leader and we do not have any additional information to provide at this time. I'll finish where I started. Carlyle has the capital and expertise to have a long-term focus, which has served our investors well for decades. We have three strong segments that are well-positioned to navigate the current environment and capture value. Our quarterly and year-to-date results underscore the strength of this platform and Carlyle has delivered through various market cycles and transitions. I'm proud of where we are today and feel that we can continue driving long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll hand things over to Curt Buser, our Chief Financial Officer.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard Carlyle delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date results and a particularly challenging quarter, a testament to the strength of our investment platform and quality of our three global business segments. While economic and geopolitical uncertainties are creating headwinds, our business continues to deliver impactful results. Consider the following, fee-related earnings of $632 million year-to-date are up almost 50% from the same-period last year. And are already higher than any full-year in the firm's history. Our carry funds across asset classes and geographies have appreciated 10% year-to-date. As Bill noted, our portfolio construction and proven investment approach, is why we are delivering outsized returns and we are well-positioned to continue to do so. Our net accrued performance revenue of $4.1 billion is up from $3.9 billion at the end of last year and that is after realizing $780 million of net performance revenue year-to-date. And while fund raising is clearly more challenging this year, we have raised $25 billion in new capital year-to-date that translates into almost $90 billion in new capital formation, when you include completed strategic transactions such as Fortitude and CBAM. With that backdrop, let me provide an update on each of our global business segments and then I'll dig into the financial results. Our global private-equity business continues to deliver solid results across corporate private equity, real-estate, infrastructure and natural resources. Fee-related earnings year-to-date in global private-equity of $409 million has increased 45% with both topline growth and margin expansion. Our current vintage of funds taking carry, has led to current strong current carry generation and as we look-forward, we know that we have an equivalent amount of net accrued carry on funds that has not yet taken carry, as we do from those currently generating cash carry. So we believe, we are well-positioned to continue to generate strong performance revenues in future periods. Global private-equity is also poised for future growth, having raised almost $10 billion in new capital year-to-date and having deployed almost $16 billion into new investments. While in the near-term, the pace of corporate private-equity deployment and realizations is likely to slow, given challenging capital markets and we're already seen the impact of solar CP fund raising. Over the long-term, we see significant opportunities for continued growth across our global private-equity investment platform. In global credit, our assets under management have nearly doubled, in just this year to $141 billion and FRE has more than doubled year-to-date as the impact from our strategic transactions has been highly accretive. Our investment teams are active across the liquidity spectrum, taking advantage of market dislocations to invest in opportunities with increasingly desirable risk-reward characteristics. Many of our largest strategies are floating-rate in nature, so fund investors benefit from increased current yields. At the same time, while current credit quality remains good, we are actively position our portfolios to withstand worsening economic conditions and potentially higher default rates. We do not anticipate any near-term challenges that put existing management fee streams at-risk. So the slower pace of activity may slow capital markets transaction fees. Looking at future growth, global credit has raised $12 billion of new capital this year across 11 strategies. Year-to-date, CLO formation has been strong with 7 new CLOs price for $3 billion. The velocity is falling due to-market conditions. Direct lending generated near-record originations in the quarter with gross new loans of more than $1.5 billion and we are seeing significant demand for private credit across our asset type and geography. And fortitude continues to perform well with a robust pipeline of growth opportunities and we continue to expect it can double its size over the next few years. Moving to Global Investment Solutions. This business is well-positioned to support the increasing liquidity and portfolio management needs of global fund investors. Secondary investment activity is poised to accelerate, as fund investors seek to optimize their own portfolios given market volatility. Global investment solutions has seen year-to-date FRE tick lower to $55 million, partially owing to the negative impact of foreign-exchange rates. However, AlpInvest is making strong progress, investing their current vintages of co-investments and secondary funds and are likely to be back-in the market to raise their next-generation of funds sooner than expected. Global Investment Solutions depreciation was flat in quarter and is up 9% year-to-date, with net accrued carry of $365 million, up more than 14% year-to-date. To summarize, we expect the pace of activity to slow over the next few quarters in certain areas, while others will remain active. This is why our diversification strategy remains core to our future growth. And importantly, as we've seen in past cycles, the work and diligence we do now positioned us to come out on the other side that much more ready to act. Turning back now to firmwide results. Let me dig deeper into third quarter earnings. Let's start with fee-related earnings. As Dan mentioned, third quarter fee revenues are down about $24 million from the second-quarter, due to lower catchup management fees and fee-related performance revenues. That said, fee revenues are up a robust 31% from a year-ago. And as a reminder, more than 90% of our management fee revenues are in closed-end fund structures and not subject to redemptions. Cash based compensation expense in the third quarter was down sequentially, largely as a function of lower-fee related performance revenue and the impact of foreign-exchange on translation of compensation in Europe. G&A expenses of $101 million in the third quarter, increase as we hosted our Global Investment Conference and travel and entertainment largely returned to pre pandemic levels. Expenses continued to be impacted by inflationary pressure and the strong labor market that will continue to impact expenses into 2023. FRE margin was 37% in the third quarter and year-to-date, FRE margin of 38% increased more than 400 basis-points year-over-year. For the full-year, we now expect fee-related earnings to be between $825 million and $850 million. With the headwinds from foreign-exchange translation, slowing buy out fund-raising and unit transaction fees each impacting expected full-year results. That said, we still expect 2022 FRE to increase more than 35% compared to 2021. And we remain confident that our long-term FRE growth trend remains intact. Net realized performance revenues of $391 million in the third quarter, where our third-largest quarter on record. Year-to-date, net realized performance revenues of $780 million, highlights the strength of our portfolio and our team's ability to monetize investments despite difficult conditions. I said last quarter that I expect that our second-half of 2022 net realized performance revenues to exceed the first-half of the year. With just the third quarter's result, we've already surpassed that goal. Our net accrued performance revenue balance of $4.1 billion and remaining fair-value of investments in our carry funds of $136 billion, gives us confidence that over time we will realize a high-level of performance revenues and distributable earnings. Our accrued carry remains near record levels, despite significant declines in public market valuations and increasingly higher discount and cap rates used in our valuation process. Today, our accrual represents over $11 per share in future earnings power. So let me wrap-up. We're performing well against the challenging backdrop. We're focused on growing and diversifying fee-related earnings and expanding the capabilities of our firm to drive long-term shareholder value. More broadly, each of our three global business segments are well-positioned to deliver growth and outsized returns for our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to the operator, so we take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Bill Katz from Credit Suisse. Mr. Katz, your line is open.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. Very first question Bill, thanks so much, I could hear your voice again. Just as you think about, I appreciate you have nothing else to say. But maybe you could help us understand what factors or dynamics you're looking for in a new CEO? How you're thinking about internal versus external candidates? And what if anything, did you learn in terms of this transition about where they franchises headed. Thank you.\nBill Conway: Thanks for the question, Bill and you know I really can't answer it. And because of that, we're going to give you a bonus question. But having said that, we are making good progress on finding the right leader. We want to find somebody that is better than I am, would be one of the comments I'd make. And we don't really have anything additional to add at this time. But as soon as we do, we will report to you and of course, in the interim, the firm is operating well and from position of strength, but that take you bonus question.\nWilliam Katz: All right, thank you gave a shot. So just maybe in terms of one of the biggest things we hear on the story line, is that without the leadership it's going be very difficult to grow the business. On-top of so a very difficult backdrop and your AUM SKU. So I appreciate you went through the three businesses, but can you sort of level-set, where we are in terms of your prior goals to raise assets? And as you look-ahead, help us understand where you see the best opportunities maybe it sounds like the Investment Solutions side, but just anything to help us frame out sort of path to higher-fee paying AUM? Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: Hi Bill, its Curt. Let me kick it off and then I'm going to have partner maybe to join in afterwards. So let me just bring you back to the beginning of 2021, which actually wasn't that long ago and we set a goal for 2024 to generate $800 million of fee-related earnings, $800 million of net realized performance revenues and $1.6 billion of pretax DE, we've met those goals. This year, year-to-date, $1.5 billion of DE and actually through three quarter last year, obviously record numbers. From a fund-raising and capital accumulation perspective, we have -- we generated about -- we raised about $50 billion last year, this year $25 billion year-to-date. But more importantly, roughly $90 billion of capital accumulation when you consider the strategic transaction we've also had. Our relationships are good with our LPs, we're continuing to work on those relationships. Pete on the road, as we speak here today, doing just that. And I would just say that the prospects for the future remain really good and I'm eager about all of the market dislocations that we're seeing in here, because I know that my colleagues are going to really take advantage of this. So I'll pause there and see if any my colleagues want to join in, what I just said.\nPeter Clare: Hi guys, thanks. Bill, thanks for the question and I'll just add a perspective on fundraising on the global private-equity side. Overall, though -- as you heard from Curt in our funds are performing really well with 10% appreciation across all of our carry generating funds, a little bit higher than that across the global private equity business. As Bill mentioned, the portfolio construction really matters and one of the hallmarks of our investment strategy is to build portfolios that have less risk and really resilient earnings power in the businesses that we invest in. And we outperform in tougher economic times, as our funds have done historically in tough economic times. And I think that track record consistent returns in tough economic environments going to help us on the fundraising front. So even though, the market is clearly congested fundraising for large buyout has slowed down. We do expect the ultimately the -- all of our funds that were currently raising now will in aggregate commitment similar-size to the current vintages. But it's important to remember, you prior the broader today then just buyouts and we're growing in many other areas. Our US real-estate business is growing significantly, our Europe Technology business has grown a lot. And you'll probably hear more from market, look how the growth that we're seeing in credit in Global Solutions.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. Hi Bill, it's Mark Jenkins here on the credit side. I would say similar to, Pete. I mean, I've been on the road talking with our investors. There is a sense opportunity when we talk to investors about what's going on in credit markets in particular, as they seen a repricing of risk. And we're taking advantage of that. Similar to see, I mean we have a broad platform here at Carlyle that spans everything from liquid or private credit and real assets. And I would say across the opportunistic play and frankly even on the CLO space, we continue to see growth. And as a good down the various channels that institutional insurance retail, we continue to see those as great avenue of growth for the business and opportunities for our investors.\nRuulke Bagijn: And this is, Ruulke. In terms of growth, our platform is very well-positioned to benefit from the market conditions, especially with liquidity means increasing across markets. And let me also remind you a bit about AlpInvest. We managed $63 billion of assets under management and secondary's is our largest and profitable part of our business, managing $21 billion of assets under management. But we also have leading co-investments and to any fund investment businesses. Our performance has been strong with long-term net outperformance across all strategies of around 500 to 1,100 basis-points for last 10 years, but over the last 20 years. And we continue to deploy it also despite the current market conditions and we expect actually to be back-in the market next year with several strategies and being able from the opportunities that we see in the market, which are especially obviously also present in the secondary business where our liquidity needs are increasing across markets at this point in time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Mr. Worthington, your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you, good morning. Public shareholders seem to be concerned about the leadership uncertainty. And I think we can see that in the underperformance of the shares. Commitments this quarter seems so and logic would suggest that leadership uncertainty could be a factor here. So the question is, do you think leadership uncertainty is having an impact on fundraising? If so, how meaningful is that uncertainty having on either the size or timing of commitments? And then I guess most importantly, do you think the choice of a new CEO can win back concern clients or is the damage somewhat irreversible for funds in-market right now? Thanks.\nBill Conway: Thanks, Ken. Well the short answer would be no, in terms of the impact of the CEO change on fundraising. I've been on the road a lot myself, talking to investors. Pete was right when, he said that it has slowed down to the congestion in the markets. But I think, I don't see any long-term damage at all and this. And remember, I'm an investor, I've been an investor for 35 years. I was the Chief Investment Officer to Carlyle before I was CEO the first time. And I think the investors in our funds they like seeing somebody at the top who they know understand exactly what they're trying to accomplish.\nCurtis Buser: Just add-on to that. Hi, Ken, its Curt. Look I think there's a couple of things that are really important. First, the aggregate dynamics that are affecting lots of the private-equity players, not just us. The denominator effect that congested in the market, et-cetera. So look, we're freight to that like others are, but our diversification and other products whether in energy, natural resources, credit solutions, as you've heard. The experience is very different based on that performance and industry and sector matter a whole lot. We're seeing a lot of good opportunities there. And so, I think that the comment that you started out with around leadership, people are seeing the very strong leadership that we have across our funds and our teams and who's at the top matters, but not to the extent that you're implying the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Mr. Davitt, your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi good morning, everyone. My question is on solutions. You and others are obviously hyping up how big of an opportunity this could be as investors increasingly look for liquidity. But to your point on AlpInvest needing to be back-in the market, there's obviously another sides of the equation, right. You need to raise in the dry powder to take advantage of that. So why is this a strategy that you think will really have a lot of demand, given where we are in the cycle. As it seems, LP demand is really skewing more towards things like real assets infrastructure and private credit.\nRuulke Bagijn: I think that's a great question. I mean let me also be clear, I mean we do have a very significant dry powder at this point in time for the strategy, which is good, because the market is changing as we speak. What we've seen is that public market valuations have decreased much faster than private markets valuations and I think as you are aware, the percentage of illiquid holdings of total AUM of larger investors in US has increased very significantly. As a result of the denominator effect, LPs are considering their portfolios. They consider portfolio rebalancing, they consider selling part of their portfolios that's typically an area. To the extent, the LPs are considering to sell part of their private-equity exposure that is an area we can obviously greatly benefit as a platform with our secondary business. At the same time, it's broader than that. I think the liquidity needs in a markets are increasing, also private SKU managers GDPs do see the market changing their exit opportunities genuinely are becoming narrower, which actually is a positive support for significant trends like continuation vehicles, in which we play a very market-leading role. So whether you look at a GP side of the market or LP side of the market with our secondary and portfolio financing platform, where we have market-leading positions, we think we can benefit.\nPeter Clare: And Patrick, I'll delve really briefly, we're also not going to top of our own great performance, but performance in our solutions business has been really strong. And so once the times for those products come back to-market. Similarly, really good about how we'll be positioned. And so very optimistic about the future and it's been a really good story for us. The growth really since 2019 has been very strong in this business. We've taken it from almost nothing to a really interesting story and one that we remain very optimistic about going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian McKenna from JMP Securities. Mr. McKenna, your line is now open.\nBrian McKenna: Great. Thank you. So I know the broader capital management strategy will likely be determined by the new CEO. But how are you thinking about the trajectory of the dividend into next year, particularly given the level of FRE growth in 2022. And what will likely be some incremental growth in 2023? And then related just given where the stock is trading, how are you thinking about buybacks here?\nCurtis Buser: Brian, it's Curt. Hi thanks for those good questions. So first let me just remind everybody, we increase the dividend from $1 per share to $1.30 per share at the beginning of this year, a 30% increase, we are very much focused on continuing to grow our business. We want our dividend to be sustainable fixed. We want to move-in one direction up, it's something that the Board will consider typically at year end in terms of how much. And also in terms of viewing kind of our various capital needs and requirements to grow the business and also consider buybacks, as you talked about. But look, we're thinking about just that in terms of how much to go up. We expect us to -- to think about that in that context of how to appropriately allocate capital. From a buyback perspective, look there's a good opportunity here we actually think that we'll continue to manage our dilution from equity grants. And as we think about balancing those buybacks with other capital needs, we're going to lean into growth. But clearly the attractive price of the stock right now really raises the bar in terms of how we think about acquisitions and the other external uses of capital to grow the business. But make no doubt about it, we're focused on shareholder value, growing shareholder value. And you point out a couple of the levers in the pull backs to do just that. So thank you for your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Mr. Schorr, your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. So heard from you and heard from others about the pace is likely to slow that goes for deployment fundraising monetization's kind of everything in this backdrop. Also heard, it's going to take a while from you and others. So get it the world is pretty disruptive. I'm curious on how you might attribute this slowing to -- is it the lack of available funding, is that the absolute cost, higher-cost of funding. That's producing these wide/bid ask and then maybe turn it. And so potential positive, what are going to be the signs that you look for or we should look for to see that the environment is improving?\nPeter Clare: Sure. This is Peter, I'll take that question. And I'll give you the perspective from the private-equity side of our business. I think it's certainly a combination of factors that leads to slow-down in deal flow. First, I would say that the level of deployment investment activity in 2021 was unusually high. So that was really a peak, so there's no doubt that we are going to come off that. The level of overall investment activity this year was more in-line with our typical annual run-rate for deployment in investing in the private-equity side. Looking-forward into 2023, I do expect the investment phase to slow a bit further, which is really two or three factors driving that. First, obviously the increase in interest rates has an impact. But for all, private-equity buyers impact of that and you can assess. You know what the -- you can go out and get debt financing commitment the cost of it is. But because the cost is higher, prices come down a bit ultimately. Because, we're going to require the same rate of return, higher rates of return in this environment, so prices for sellers will be lower. Because of that, you get less people coming to-market to sell businesses right now. I know you're not going to get top-tick valuations given -- what the public markets have done in terms of trading off a bit in and higher interest expense you got less sellers willing to sell in that environment. And third and last factor, I'll touch on is of course the uncertainty out there in the environment or certainly the expectation that the economy is going to slow. And because of that, buyers and sellers are less likely to agree on the price for a business today, which makes fewer transactions happen. But I don't want to be overly negative, a lot of transactions are still happening. And we have invested a lot over the past quarter and I'm seeing one of those deals we got debt-financed and yes, the financing was more expensive. But deals are getting done, but I do expect across the market to see a slow down on deployment in 2023.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. Hi Glenn, it's Mark here. On the credit side, I would say that, we've got a different dynamic going-in that. We think the opportunity set is increasing specifically in private credit, where the capital market is effectively become less liquid if you want to call that, I won't say it's eased up. And until really the bank at most of those commitments lot of balance sheet, it's going to be a very good opportunity. And we see that as very good opportunity not in the next 6 to 12 months, we think that'll be given the slowdown in the economy a 12 month to 24 month opportunity. Where the pace of employment can pick up, we're going to a period of time. I think when you look in the liquid book, we still have had good formation on the CLO side, despite what's going on in the marketplace. And if we feel liabilities adjust, which we expect low we'll see probably more continued pace on that side as well. So I think for credit, we feel very good about the opportunity set and the funnel of opportunities that are coming down to us right now and we're quite bullish on what we see.\nGerry O'Hara: Mark. I wonder, if we could just follow-up on that. A question I was going to ask was going to be on CLO performance was decent, okay hung in there in the quarter. It's down a few percent, both US and European for the last 12 months, which is a lot better than the public markets but still down. And just curious, does that kind of performance profile and then just the higher-rate environment. How the typical CLO investor interprets that? And so I wonder, if I could get a specific CLOs formation thought process over the next year or two? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. I think, obviously two components of CLO formation at the asset-level right now, which is very attractive and we form the liabilities as well. And I think the past 6 months in particular has been more challenging on the liability side, so the leverage that we put on those vehicles. And we're going through a period where that formation has been more challenged. That being said, as Curt said, we've completed 7 CLOs this year-to-date, which would be more in-line with the regular year for us. And so I think the challenge will be for managers just generally is that access to the liability side, which Carlyle given where the world's largest CLO manager and one of the better performers and have position our portfolios quite well. We're able to attract those liabilities, in particular the equity as well and we commit to the equity ourselves off the balance sheet, so that does perpetuate the formation CLO for our business in particular.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Mr. Kotowski, your line is now open.\nChris Kotowski: Good morning, thank you. Most of mine have been asked, but I noticed that on CPA there is another couple of $100 million of commitments there. And I'm wondering, is the fundraising on that done or is there a chance to extend the fundraising into calendar 2023? So that LPs could use their next vintage year commitments to do come into that fund?\nPeter Clare: Thanks for the credit. Yes, we do intend to keep fundraising going into 2023. That was our assumption all along and so we will do that and you're right that will open up a number of investors and a number of our investors have come to us and please, come back and see in 2023 I have more allocation then, so we do intend to keep fundraising going in '23.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. And that'll be with for catch-up fees and all that?\nPeter Clare: Yes. I mean that's yes no quota in terms of the LP agreements and that would be included.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Great, thanks. I was hoping maybe we could get a little bit just an update around the fortitude outlook and kind of how your how you're balancing what you see or where you see the opportunities for both organic our organic first blocks and transactions and what appears to be an increasingly competitive market, but also more-and-more attractive one. So any comments or context would be helpful there. Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: Hi Gerry, it's Curt. I'll start with some numbers and then Mark will provide some color around it. So fortitude is doing really well, just as a reminder everybody is about $45 billion of fee-earning AUM. There's also about $9 billion that they've invested directly into our funds. And maybe more importantly, they have over $4 billion of capital within fortitude itself. And that's important, because that's the capital that they can use to essentially double their business, which we think we can accomplish over the next couple of years. And so we're opportunistic in terms of kind of how they're doing in both from and also just from an adjusted book-value. And from a return-on-equity perspective that business is continuing to perform well. But Mark, I don't know, if you have more color to add?\nMark Jenkins: Yes, the only thing I'd add Curt and its Mark here, is that -- the macro backdrop and what FX with these transactions is that insurers are looking for ways to better manage their capital and their operations in more efficient manner. And that hasn't changed and in fact in higher-rate environment, all else being equal. It's generally made it more attractive or more favorable for sellers to transact on these legacy blocks, which is what we traffic and some policies perspective. So that pipeline that we see continues to be very strong and the timeline on these transactions are traditionally longer than regular corporate M&A process, it given the complexity of the books and we're involved in many processes right now and we feel very positive about what we see in that regard. So we're quite comfortable with how far its going.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS. Mr. Beatty, your line is now open.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on capital management. I appreciate Curt's comments earlier about wanting to maintain steady dividend and what kind of ratcheted up year-after-year. My understanding is that, that's primarily that process has been primarily based around FRE in the past. I just wanted to ask about the potential for incorporating realized carry in the level of the dividend. You've managed to maintain that fairly well this year, indicated that maybe averaging $1 billion or so in the out years. So it seems like something that might be able to be incorporated in capital distribution to investors, but wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: Adam, it is correct. Thanks for that and thanks for recognizing the strength really of our accrued carry and carry generation we've had. $4.1 billion of net accrued carry-on the balance sheet roughly $11 per share in future earnings power. But we think that that's going to come out, capital market permitting roughly $1 billion per year. But just as Pete noted, what we'll see some slowdown next year could be a little lighter than that. Our approach on the dividend however, really is one of making it a fixed dividend that we -- that is fully sustainable that we can grow. And we think using really kind of recurring revenues, primarily FRE is the way to look at that. But we also have to balance it amongst all of the capital needs that we see, how to invest in growth, how do you consider buybacks and managing dilutions and also how to return capital to shareholders. And look there is a variety of levers as I said before to grow shareholder value and that's what we want to do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mike Brown from KBW. Mr. Brown, your line is now open.\nMike Brown: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. So I appreciate the updated FRE expectations for 2022? Any early read on expectations for next year or any color on how we should think about that FRE growth and FRE margin, as we think about 2023? Thank you.\nCurtis Buser: And Mike it's Curt, thanks for the question. Look just is consistent with our past practice. We will provide more granular detail on '23 at beginning of '23 after we completed all of our year end processes and the like. But let me just reiterate. This year we've grown FREs 50% past decade, it's a 15% CAGR. So we're focused on -- you heard Bill say, we remain committed to growing FRE. We think our diversified business model helps us do that, we're very focused on efficiently and effectively run the business. We'll continue to make investments, whether that's in growing our distribution platform or in technology to help us operate more efficiently. But we're going to make sure that working here to focus on how we grow FRE in the aggregate, because that matters more than just margin. But margins also important as a tool to grow more FRE dollars. And I'm confident that we'll continue to -- our FRE growth trend as we go forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Blostein, your line is now open.\nRyan Bailey: Good morning this is Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex and maybe piggybacking off the prior question a little bit. So if we come back to private-equity fund-raising, obviously and you've reiterated business, it's a challenging environment for the industry. You have a number of flagships in the market over the next 12 months and you had fairly strong realizations year-to-date out of private-equity. With the delayed fundraising, do you still expect management fees to be able to grow in '23 versus '22 within private-equity?\nCurtis Buser: So Ryan, it's Curt here. Let me take that. So we're focused on a lot of things to grow the business. I'm going to give you more granular detail on '23 next year. We had very nice top-line growth this year in private-equity, any given quarter and really any given year is always tough to call exactly but we're focused on long-term trends. And what I really like here in private equity is, we have a number of things to focus on. Natural resources, energy, our real-estate business, our technology initiatives, our European technology platform, very strong. So there is a number of things for growth in that business and we're focused on growing FRE on all of our big businesses in the aggregate and believe we can do that in '23 as well, I'll give you more detail next year.\nOperator: Thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Cyprys, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, and this is [indiscernible] signing in for Mike, thank you very much for taking the question. My question is more about how you think about the way the mark-to-market valuation of carry or lack thereof. How -- what do you think the market is missing around how the way to think about carry. And as it intend them about how should I be thinking about Carlyle's ability to realize the over $4 billion of accrued carry you have on the balance sheet right now. Thank you.\nBill Conway: I love your question. The Ministry around valuation of Carrier look, I think it's been under-appreciated for a long, long-time. This is a battle that we have bought four years in terms of trying to educate people. I'll just reiterate, what we have over $4 billion in net accrued carry on the balance sheet, underpinned by $136 billion remaining fair-value on our funds. This has been a tough challenging market in a lot of fronts. But even in all of that, our funds have appreciated 10% year-to-date, which is really good. I mean, if you think about how Pete and Mark and Ruulke and all other teams has built their fund. Portfolio construction is still centers opening remarks really matters all three have done it, really in ways that are key to there. I think it is really positions us well. There is no -- I don't have the magic perfect crystal ball on the future and I wish I had better. But I'm feeling really good about how we continue to drive, carry -- you saw almost $400 million of realizations in this quarter. We'll get will probably slow a little bit here or there, but overall really strong even with the difficult backdrop. So I get -- I fully agree with you that why this is undervalued at $11 of value in terms of future earnings and continues to perform well. So thanks for your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Of course. I mean, if I could just sneak in a quick follow-up, assuming this under evaluation carries on for an extended period of time. What levers [indiscernible] I guess I've a better align incentives of the carry perhaps with base you may place a high-value on it or in terms of kind of returning that back to shareholders in some way, some shape or form?\nBill Conway: Look, alignment matters in terms of compensation strategies but also in terms of beginning able to drive continued growth in our business. And so while we continue to embrace our balance sheet light model, being able to use capital that is generally been generated from carry production to be able to reinvest that into fee-related earnings businesses to grow just like we did with Fortitude and C-Band earlier this year, we'll continue to look for those opportunities. Obviously today, the bar for how we look at those things is higher than before. But we're going to continue to aggressively use our balance sheet to grow, but also balancing that with growing dividends, buying back stock and other tools to grow the firm. But carry is a key component of generating that capital to enable us to do all of those things.\nOperator: Thank you our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, thanks for the follow-up. Could you give us some perspective on the underlying corporate PE portfolio operating trends kind of from quarter-to-quarter this year revenue, EBITDA, gross margin vis-a-vis inflation?\nCurtis Buser: Yes. Hi Patrick, it's Curt. I presume you're asking about the underlying portfolio companies and is that's the question, then I have people will chime in here on that.\nPatrick Davitt: Yes. That's what I'm asking.\nPeter Clare: Sure across the corporate private-equity portfolio, the companies have continued to perform very strongly. Revenue growth overall has been in the low-double-digits across that portfolio. And many companies are passing on price increases, but also demand has remained really strong in most areas the economy so-far. On margins, there's clearly there is some cost pressure, so on margins, margins are growing in the mid-single-digit. So roughly half the level of revenue growth is the level of earnings growth that we're seeing. So businesses continue to perform well, we continue to get earnings growth and that's what's supporting the valuations in the portfolio is the earnings growth that we're seeing across the portfolio. That's Corporate Private Equity and I'd say overall across natural resources and infrastructure the results have been even better. What's happened with energy prices and that's one of the portfolios performed even stronger.\nPatrick Davitt: And that's LTM, I think, the revenue and EBITDA?\nCurtis Buser: Can you repeat that, sorry - \nPatrick Davitt: That's LTM, I assume the revenue and EBITDA growth or is that the 3Q?\nPeter Clare: That is year-to-date, that's year-to-date results.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no additional questions in the queue at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nBill Conway: Thank you all for your time this morning with us. Should you have any follow-up questions, feel free-to reach-out to Investor Relations at any point. Otherwise, we'll look-forward to speaking with you again on next quarter's call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect, everyone have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Yes. Hi Bill, it's Mark Jenkins here on the credit side. I would say similar to, Pete. I mean, I've been on the road talking with our investors. There is a sense opportunity when we talk to investors about what's going on in credit markets in particular, as they seen a repricing of risk. And we're taking advantage of that. Similar to see, I mean we have a broad platform here at Carlyle that spans everything from liquid or private credit and real assets. And I would say across the opportunistic play and frankly even on the CLO space, we continue to see growth. And as a good down the various channels that institutional insurance retail, we continue to see those as great avenue of growth for the business and opportunities for our investors. Yes. Hi Glenn, it's Mark here. On the credit side, I would say that, we've got a different dynamic going-in that. We think the opportunity set is increasing specifically in private credit, where the capital market is effectively become less liquid if you want to call that, I won't say it's eased up. And until really the bank at most of those commitments lot of balance sheet, it's going to be a very good opportunity. And we see that as very good opportunity not in the next 6 to 12 months, we think that'll be given the slowdown in the economy a 12 month to 24 month opportunity. Where the pace of employment can pick up, we're going to a period of time. I think when you look in the liquid book, we still have had good formation on the CLO side, despite what's going on in the marketplace. And if we feel liabilities adjust, which we expect low we'll see probably more continued pace on that side as well. So I think for credit, we feel very good about the opportunity set and the funnel of opportunities that are coming down to us right now and we're quite bullish on what we see. Yes. I think, obviously two components of CLO formation at the asset-level right now, which is very attractive and we form the liabilities as well. And I think the past 6 months in particular has been more challenging on the liability side, so the leverage that we put on those vehicles. And we're going through a period where that formation has been more challenged. That being said, as Curt said, we've completed 7 CLOs this year-to-date, which would be more in-line with the regular year for us. And so I think the challenge will be for managers just generally is that access to the liability side, which Carlyle given where the world's largest CLO manager and one of the better performers and have position our portfolios quite well. We're able to attract those liabilities, in particular the equity as well and we commit to the equity ourselves off the balance sheet, so that does perpetuate the formation CLO for our business in particular. Yes, the only thing I'd add Curt and its Mark here, is that -- the macro backdrop and what FX with these transactions is that insurers are looking for ways to better manage their capital and their operations in more efficient manner. And that hasn't changed and in fact in higher-rate environment, all else being equal. It's generally made it more attractive or more favorable for sellers to transact on these legacy blocks, which is what we traffic and some policies perspective. So that pipeline that we see continues to be very strong and the timeline on these transactions are traditionally longer than regular corporate M&A process, it given the complexity of the books and we're involved in many processes right now and we feel very positive about what we see in that regard. So we're quite comfortable with how far its going."

            "name": "Bill Conway",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. It's been a while since I've spoken with many of you that I'm pleased to be on the call today to discuss Carlyle's results for the quarter. While Carlyle is in a transition period, as we move towards a new CEO, the firm is operating well and I'm proud of our teams around the world as we continue to perform for all of our stakeholders. There are two important points I'd like to focus on today. First, I'll touch on the results and highlight the strength and diversity of Carlyle's global business. Second, as we navigate a challenging markets in a difficult economic environment, I'll discuss how our approach and investment experience, it's helping us manage through economic uncertainty and positioning the firm for the future. I'll also give a brief comment on the status of our search for a permanent CEO. First, let me provide some perspective on Carlyle today. In the third quarter, Carlyle delivered solid results for our fund investors and our shareholders despite the market volatility. And year-to-date, our results are adjusted strong with FRE up almost 50%. None of this is by chance, we were able to deliver this outcome due the breadth and depth of our businesses, strong business leadership and highly capable investment teams around the world. Let me be very clear, the firm's strategic focus on growing fee related earnings, diversifying our business mix and earning stream and improving the way in which we operate has not changed at all. These core tenants will not change regardless of who is leading the firm. We have three global business segments that are run by three strong leaders, each of which serves as stewards of investor capital and drivers of growth for our shareholders. Ruulke Bagijn in Global Investment Solutions, Peter Clare in Global Private Equity and Mark Jenkins in Global Credit are all on the call with me today and you'll have the opportunity to ask them your questions later. As we navigate through more challenging markets than any of us have seen in a decade, the firm is in an enviable position. Carlyle and I have been doing this for 35 years and we've seen all types of markets and economic cycles. We are confident that each of our businesses have the resources, investment talent and capital of over $74 billion of dry powder to capture opportunities for our stakeholders. Our teams are highly experienced and have worked together through various cycles. In fact, the partners of our investment teams have worked together at Carlyle for more than 15 years on average with decades more at firms across the globe. Moving on, let me discuss the broader environment and how that impacts our investment outlook. All of you will see the same things we do. Rising interest rates, high levels of inflation, geopolitical uncertainty. Each of which lead to increased market volatility and headwinds for investors and operators. This is unlikely to resolve in the short-term, now our teams are not sitting back and waiting for better days. Certainly this market is tougher for some parts of our businesses than others and on some parts of our business, this environment will create opportunities. And two examples come to mind, our credit opportunities business, which you see far more lucrative places to put money to work and our solutions business, which will have even more chances at attractive returns to finance buyers and sellers of existing fund positions. One of our core strength has been in the area of investment risk management, particularly in the construction of our portfolios. We certainly take risk, you can't make money without doing so, but we need to get paid-for the risk we take. Until recently, the investors will make the most money have taken the most risk. That is in our style. Portfolio construction matters, it's a differentiator that continues to position our business to deliver outsized relative performance for fund investors across market cycles. Our portfolios are built with diversification by geography, industries, deal size and risk. And portfolio construction isn't adjusted in our private-equity business, but in Global Credit and Global Solutions as well. For instance, in our CLO businesses, CLO portfolios, where we manage hundreds of credits. This investment strategy has led to default rates at half the industry average. Another example would be our US real-estate business, which is investing its ninth closed-end fund with committed capital of $8 billion. This is an experienced team with a long and successful track-record. In terms of portfolio construction, they favor demographics over GDP. Their current fund has almost no exposure to office, hotel and retail, which represents 60% of the typical real-estate fund. In volatile markets like today's, our fund results should reflect the benefits of our strategy and so-far they have. Before I close, let me comment on our search for a permanent CEO. In short, the search continues. The Board and search Committee are making good progress finding the right leader and we do not have any additional information to provide at this time. I'll finish where I started. Carlyle has the capital and expertise to have a long-term focus, which has served our investors well for decades. We have three strong segments that are well-positioned to navigate the current environment and capture value. Our quarterly and year-to-date results underscore the strength of this platform and Carlyle has delivered through various market cycles and transitions. I'm proud of where we are today and feel that we can continue driving long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll hand things over to Curt Buser, our Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for the question, Bill and you know I really can't answer it. And because of that, we're going to give you a bonus question. But having said that, we are making good progress on finding the right leader. We want to find somebody that is better than I am, would be one of the comments I'd make. And we don't really have anything additional to add at this time. But as soon as we do, we will report to you and of course, in the interim, the firm is operating well and from position of strength, but that take you bonus question. Thanks, Ken. Well the short answer would be no, in terms of the impact of the CEO change on fundraising. I've been on the road a lot myself, talking to investors. Pete was right when, he said that it has slowed down to the congestion in the markets. But I think, I don't see any long-term damage at all and this. And remember, I'm an investor, I've been an investor for 35 years. I was the Chief Investment Officer to Carlyle before I was CEO the first time. And I think the investors in our funds they like seeing somebody at the top who they know understand exactly what they're trying to accomplish. I love your question. The Ministry around valuation of Carrier look, I think it's been under-appreciated for a long, long-time. This is a battle that we have bought four years in terms of trying to educate people. I'll just reiterate, what we have over $4 billion in net accrued carry on the balance sheet, underpinned by $136 billion remaining fair-value on our funds. This has been a tough challenging market in a lot of fronts. But even in all of that, our funds have appreciated 10% year-to-date, which is really good. I mean, if you think about how Pete and Mark and Ruulke and all other teams has built their fund. Portfolio construction is still centers opening remarks really matters all three have done it, really in ways that are key to there. I think it is really positions us well. There is no -- I don't have the magic perfect crystal ball on the future and I wish I had better. But I'm feeling really good about how we continue to drive, carry -- you saw almost $400 million of realizations in this quarter. We'll get will probably slow a little bit here or there, but overall really strong even with the difficult backdrop. So I get -- I fully agree with you that why this is undervalued at $11 of value in terms of future earnings and continues to perform well. So thanks for your question. Look, alignment matters in terms of compensation strategies but also in terms of beginning able to drive continued growth in our business. And so while we continue to embrace our balance sheet light model, being able to use capital that is generally been generated from carry production to be able to reinvest that into fee-related earnings businesses to grow just like we did with Fortitude and C-Band earlier this year, we'll continue to look for those opportunities. Obviously today, the bar for how we look at those things is higher than before. But we're going to continue to aggressively use our balance sheet to grow, but also balancing that with growing dividends, buying back stock and other tools to grow the firm. But carry is a key component of generating that capital to enable us to do all of those things. Thank you all for your time this morning with us. Should you have any follow-up questions, feel free-to reach-out to Investor Relations at any point. Otherwise, we'll look-forward to speaking with you again on next quarter's call."

            "name": "Peter Clare",
            "content": "Hi guys, thanks. Bill, thanks for the question and I'll just add a perspective on fundraising on the global private-equity side. Overall, though -- as you heard from Curt in our funds are performing really well with 10% appreciation across all of our carry generating funds, a little bit higher than that across the global private equity business. As Bill mentioned, the portfolio construction really matters and one of the hallmarks of our investment strategy is to build portfolios that have less risk and really resilient earnings power in the businesses that we invest in. And we outperform in tougher economic times, as our funds have done historically in tough economic times. And I think that track record consistent returns in tough economic environments going to help us on the fundraising front. So even though, the market is clearly congested fundraising for large buyout has slowed down. We do expect the ultimately the -- all of our funds that were currently raising now will in aggregate commitment similar-size to the current vintages. But it's important to remember, you prior the broader today then just buyouts and we're growing in many other areas. Our US real-estate business is growing significantly, our Europe Technology business has grown a lot. And you'll probably hear more from market, look how the growth that we're seeing in credit in Global Solutions. And Patrick, I'll delve really briefly, we're also not going to top of our own great performance, but performance in our solutions business has been really strong. And so once the times for those products come back to-market. Similarly, really good about how we'll be positioned. And so very optimistic about the future and it's been a really good story for us. The growth really since 2019 has been very strong in this business. We've taken it from almost nothing to a really interesting story and one that we remain very optimistic about going forward. Sure. This is Peter, I'll take that question. And I'll give you the perspective from the private-equity side of our business. I think it's certainly a combination of factors that leads to slow-down in deal flow. First, I would say that the level of deployment investment activity in 2021 was unusually high. So that was really a peak, so there's no doubt that we are going to come off that. The level of overall investment activity this year was more in-line with our typical annual run-rate for deployment in investing in the private-equity side. Looking-forward into 2023, I do expect the investment phase to slow a bit further, which is really two or three factors driving that. First, obviously the increase in interest rates has an impact. But for all, private-equity buyers impact of that and you can assess. You know what the -- you can go out and get debt financing commitment the cost of it is. But because the cost is higher, prices come down a bit ultimately. Because, we're going to require the same rate of return, higher rates of return in this environment, so prices for sellers will be lower. Because of that, you get less people coming to-market to sell businesses right now. I know you're not going to get top-tick valuations given -- what the public markets have done in terms of trading off a bit in and higher interest expense you got less sellers willing to sell in that environment. And third and last factor, I'll touch on is of course the uncertainty out there in the environment or certainly the expectation that the economy is going to slow. And because of that, buyers and sellers are less likely to agree on the price for a business today, which makes fewer transactions happen. But I don't want to be overly negative, a lot of transactions are still happening. And we have invested a lot over the past quarter and I'm seeing one of those deals we got debt-financed and yes, the financing was more expensive. But deals are getting done, but I do expect across the market to see a slow down on deployment in 2023. Thanks for the credit. Yes, we do intend to keep fundraising going into 2023. That was our assumption all along and so we will do that and you're right that will open up a number of investors and a number of our investors have come to us and please, come back and see in 2023 I have more allocation then, so we do intend to keep fundraising going in '23. Yes. I mean that's yes no quota in terms of the LP agreements and that would be included. Sure across the corporate private-equity portfolio, the companies have continued to perform very strongly. Revenue growth overall has been in the low-double-digits across that portfolio. And many companies are passing on price increases, but also demand has remained really strong in most areas the economy so-far. On margins, there's clearly there is some cost pressure, so on margins, margins are growing in the mid-single-digit. So roughly half the level of revenue growth is the level of earnings growth that we're seeing. So businesses continue to perform well, we continue to get earnings growth and that's what's supporting the valuations in the portfolio is the earnings growth that we're seeing across the portfolio. That's Corporate Private Equity and I'd say overall across natural resources and infrastructure the results have been even better. What's happened with energy prices and that's one of the portfolios performed even stronger. That is year-to-date, that's year-to-date results."

            "name": "Curtis Buser",
            "content": "Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard Carlyle delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date results and a particularly challenging quarter, a testament to the strength of our investment platform and quality of our three global business segments. While economic and geopolitical uncertainties are creating headwinds, our business continues to deliver impactful results. Consider the following, fee-related earnings of $632 million year-to-date are up almost 50% from the same-period last year. And are already higher than any full-year in the firm's history. Our carry funds across asset classes and geographies have appreciated 10% year-to-date. As Bill noted, our portfolio construction and proven investment approach, is why we are delivering outsized returns and we are well-positioned to continue to do so. Our net accrued performance revenue of $4.1 billion is up from $3.9 billion at the end of last year and that is after realizing $780 million of net performance revenue year-to-date. And while fund raising is clearly more challenging this year, we have raised $25 billion in new capital year-to-date that translates into almost $90 billion in new capital formation, when you include completed strategic transactions such as Fortitude and CBAM. With that backdrop, let me provide an update on each of our global business segments and then I'll dig into the financial results. Our global private-equity business continues to deliver solid results across corporate private equity, real-estate, infrastructure and natural resources. Fee-related earnings year-to-date in global private-equity of $409 million has increased 45% with both topline growth and margin expansion. Our current vintage of funds taking carry, has led to current strong current carry generation and as we look-forward, we know that we have an equivalent amount of net accrued carry on funds that has not yet taken carry, as we do from those currently generating cash carry. So we believe, we are well-positioned to continue to generate strong performance revenues in future periods. Global private-equity is also poised for future growth, having raised almost $10 billion in new capital year-to-date and having deployed almost $16 billion into new investments. While in the near-term, the pace of corporate private-equity deployment and realizations is likely to slow, given challenging capital markets and we're already seen the impact of solar CP fund raising. Over the long-term, we see significant opportunities for continued growth across our global private-equity investment platform. In global credit, our assets under management have nearly doubled, in just this year to $141 billion and FRE has more than doubled year-to-date as the impact from our strategic transactions has been highly accretive. Our investment teams are active across the liquidity spectrum, taking advantage of market dislocations to invest in opportunities with increasingly desirable risk-reward characteristics. Many of our largest strategies are floating-rate in nature, so fund investors benefit from increased current yields. At the same time, while current credit quality remains good, we are actively position our portfolios to withstand worsening economic conditions and potentially higher default rates. We do not anticipate any near-term challenges that put existing management fee streams at-risk. So the slower pace of activity may slow capital markets transaction fees. Looking at future growth, global credit has raised $12 billion of new capital this year across 11 strategies. Year-to-date, CLO formation has been strong with 7 new CLOs price for $3 billion. The velocity is falling due to-market conditions. Direct lending generated near-record originations in the quarter with gross new loans of more than $1.5 billion and we are seeing significant demand for private credit across our asset type and geography. And fortitude continues to perform well with a robust pipeline of growth opportunities and we continue to expect it can double its size over the next few years. Moving to Global Investment Solutions. This business is well-positioned to support the increasing liquidity and portfolio management needs of global fund investors. Secondary investment activity is poised to accelerate, as fund investors seek to optimize their own portfolios given market volatility. Global investment solutions has seen year-to-date FRE tick lower to $55 million, partially owing to the negative impact of foreign-exchange rates. However, AlpInvest is making strong progress, investing their current vintages of co-investments and secondary funds and are likely to be back-in the market to raise their next-generation of funds sooner than expected. Global Investment Solutions depreciation was flat in quarter and is up 9% year-to-date, with net accrued carry of $365 million, up more than 14% year-to-date. To summarize, we expect the pace of activity to slow over the next few quarters in certain areas, while others will remain active. This is why our diversification strategy remains core to our future growth. And importantly, as we've seen in past cycles, the work and diligence we do now positioned us to come out on the other side that much more ready to act. Turning back now to firmwide results. Let me dig deeper into third quarter earnings. Let's start with fee-related earnings. As Dan mentioned, third quarter fee revenues are down about $24 million from the second-quarter, due to lower catchup management fees and fee-related performance revenues. That said, fee revenues are up a robust 31% from a year-ago. And as a reminder, more than 90% of our management fee revenues are in closed-end fund structures and not subject to redemptions. Cash based compensation expense in the third quarter was down sequentially, largely as a function of lower-fee related performance revenue and the impact of foreign-exchange on translation of compensation in Europe. G&A expenses of $101 million in the third quarter, increase as we hosted our Global Investment Conference and travel and entertainment largely returned to pre pandemic levels. Expenses continued to be impacted by inflationary pressure and the strong labor market that will continue to impact expenses into 2023. FRE margin was 37% in the third quarter and year-to-date, FRE margin of 38% increased more than 400 basis-points year-over-year. For the full-year, we now expect fee-related earnings to be between $825 million and $850 million. With the headwinds from foreign-exchange translation, slowing buy out fund-raising and unit transaction fees each impacting expected full-year results. That said, we still expect 2022 FRE to increase more than 35% compared to 2021. And we remain confident that our long-term FRE growth trend remains intact. Net realized performance revenues of $391 million in the third quarter, where our third-largest quarter on record. Year-to-date, net realized performance revenues of $780 million, highlights the strength of our portfolio and our team's ability to monetize investments despite difficult conditions. I said last quarter that I expect that our second-half of 2022 net realized performance revenues to exceed the first-half of the year. With just the third quarter's result, we've already surpassed that goal. Our net accrued performance revenue balance of $4.1 billion and remaining fair-value of investments in our carry funds of $136 billion, gives us confidence that over time we will realize a high-level of performance revenues and distributable earnings. Our accrued carry remains near record levels, despite significant declines in public market valuations and increasingly higher discount and cap rates used in our valuation process. Today, our accrual represents over $11 per share in future earnings power. So let me wrap-up. We're performing well against the challenging backdrop. We're focused on growing and diversifying fee-related earnings and expanding the capabilities of our firm to drive long-term shareholder value. More broadly, each of our three global business segments are well-positioned to deliver growth and outsized returns for our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to the operator, so we take your questions. Hi Bill, its Curt. Let me kick it off and then I'm going to have partner maybe to join in afterwards. So let me just bring you back to the beginning of 2021, which actually wasn't that long ago and we set a goal for 2024 to generate $800 million of fee-related earnings, $800 million of net realized performance revenues and $1.6 billion of pretax DE, we've met those goals. This year, year-to-date, $1.5 billion of DE and actually through three quarter last year, obviously record numbers. From a fund-raising and capital accumulation perspective, we have -- we generated about -- we raised about $50 billion last year, this year $25 billion year-to-date. But more importantly, roughly $90 billion of capital accumulation when you consider the strategic transaction we've also had. Our relationships are good with our LPs, we're continuing to work on those relationships. Pete on the road, as we speak here today, doing just that. And I would just say that the prospects for the future remain really good and I'm eager about all of the market dislocations that we're seeing in here, because I know that my colleagues are going to really take advantage of this. So I'll pause there and see if any my colleagues want to join in, what I just said. Just add-on to that. Hi, Ken, its Curt. Look I think there's a couple of things that are really important. First, the aggregate dynamics that are affecting lots of the private-equity players, not just us. The denominator effect that congested in the market, et-cetera. So look, we're freight to that like others are, but our diversification and other products whether in energy, natural resources, credit solutions, as you've heard. The experience is very different based on that performance and industry and sector matter a whole lot. We're seeing a lot of good opportunities there. And so, I think that the comment that you started out with around leadership, people are seeing the very strong leadership that we have across our funds and our teams and who's at the top matters, but not to the extent that you're implying the question. Brian, it's Curt. Hi thanks for those good questions. So first let me just remind everybody, we increase the dividend from $1 per share to $1.30 per share at the beginning of this year, a 30% increase, we are very much focused on continuing to grow our business. We want our dividend to be sustainable fixed. We want to move-in one direction up, it's something that the Board will consider typically at year end in terms of how much. And also in terms of viewing kind of our various capital needs and requirements to grow the business and also consider buybacks, as you talked about. But look, we're thinking about just that in terms of how much to go up. We expect us to -- to think about that in that context of how to appropriately allocate capital. From a buyback perspective, look there's a good opportunity here we actually think that we'll continue to manage our dilution from equity grants. And as we think about balancing those buybacks with other capital needs, we're going to lean into growth. But clearly the attractive price of the stock right now really raises the bar in terms of how we think about acquisitions and the other external uses of capital to grow the business. But make no doubt about it, we're focused on shareholder value, growing shareholder value. And you point out a couple of the levers in the pull backs to do just that. So thank you for your question. Hi Gerry, it's Curt. I'll start with some numbers and then Mark will provide some color around it. So fortitude is doing really well, just as a reminder everybody is about $45 billion of fee-earning AUM. There's also about $9 billion that they've invested directly into our funds. And maybe more importantly, they have over $4 billion of capital within fortitude itself. And that's important, because that's the capital that they can use to essentially double their business, which we think we can accomplish over the next couple of years. And so we're opportunistic in terms of kind of how they're doing in both from and also just from an adjusted book-value. And from a return-on-equity perspective that business is continuing to perform well. But Mark, I don't know, if you have more color to add? Adam, it is correct. Thanks for that and thanks for recognizing the strength really of our accrued carry and carry generation we've had. $4.1 billion of net accrued carry-on the balance sheet roughly $11 per share in future earnings power. But we think that that's going to come out, capital market permitting roughly $1 billion per year. But just as Pete noted, what we'll see some slowdown next year could be a little lighter than that. Our approach on the dividend however, really is one of making it a fixed dividend that we -- that is fully sustainable that we can grow. And we think using really kind of recurring revenues, primarily FRE is the way to look at that. But we also have to balance it amongst all of the capital needs that we see, how to invest in growth, how do you consider buybacks and managing dilutions and also how to return capital to shareholders. And look there is a variety of levers as I said before to grow shareholder value and that's what we want to do. And Mike it's Curt, thanks for the question. Look just is consistent with our past practice. We will provide more granular detail on '23 at beginning of '23 after we completed all of our year end processes and the like. But let me just reiterate. This year we've grown FREs 50% past decade, it's a 15% CAGR. So we're focused on -- you heard Bill say, we remain committed to growing FRE. We think our diversified business model helps us do that, we're very focused on efficiently and effectively run the business. We'll continue to make investments, whether that's in growing our distribution platform or in technology to help us operate more efficiently. But we're going to make sure that working here to focus on how we grow FRE in the aggregate, because that matters more than just margin. But margins also important as a tool to grow more FRE dollars. And I'm confident that we'll continue to -- our FRE growth trend as we go forward. So Ryan, it's Curt here. Let me take that. So we're focused on a lot of things to grow the business. I'm going to give you more granular detail on '23 next year. We had very nice top-line growth this year in private-equity, any given quarter and really any given year is always tough to call exactly but we're focused on long-term trends. And what I really like here in private equity is, we have a number of things to focus on. Natural resources, energy, our real-estate business, our technology initiatives, our European technology platform, very strong. So there is a number of things for growth in that business and we're focused on growing FRE on all of our big businesses in the aggregate and believe we can do that in '23 as well, I'll give you more detail next year. Yes. Hi Patrick, it's Curt. I presume you're asking about the underlying portfolio companies and is that's the question, then I have people will chime in here on that. Can you repeat that, sorry -"

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.  With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and detailed earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.carlyle.com. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website.  We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered an isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings presentation to the extent reasonably available.  Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time.  Turning to our results. For the second quarter, we generated $236 million in fee-related earnings and $529 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $1.17. We produced net realized performance revenues of $271 million, and our accrued carry balance remains at $4.3 billion. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.325 per common share. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Dan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Carlyle once again delivered strong results for the second quarter. We continue to drive growth and diversify the earnings power of our business. And importantly, our investment performance remained strong amidst the volatility and uncertainty in markets around the world. All of this is a result of clear strategic priorities and the hard work of our teams globally.  We're in a much different environment as inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty affect the real economy and financial markets. At Carlyle, we have been preparing for this complex and challenging environment, which is likely to continue in the near term. We are focused on continuously assessing risk, recalibrating valuations and capturing opportunities as we move forward.  The strength of our diversified platform, well-constructed portfolios and over $80 billion of dry powder positions us well as we have deliberately built Carlyle into a more resilient firm that is set up to adapt and manage through all types of market conditions. We are a different firm today and better positioned than ever before as we drive forward from a position of strength.  Given the environment, we know that questions about our portfolio are top of mind, so allow me to address this topic before we get into the point we'd like to discuss today. Thus far, portfolios across the firm continued to perform exceptionally well. Our focus on investment excellence and the diversification of our platform are supporting the firm's relative outperformance, with Carlyle's aggregate carry fund portfolio appreciating 3% in the second quarter, while various public benchmarks were down 10% to 20%. I'll provide some perspective, and Curt will drill into more specifics.  Our global private equity portfolio appreciated 2%, driven by strength in infrastructure and natural resources and real estate and flat performance in corporate private equity. Throughout the GPE segment, our overarching view is that we have well-constructed and well-positioned portfolios. Our approach has been always to invest in good assets and established companies led by strong management teams that have a differentiated path for growth and value creation.  As a result, we have avoided the sectors that have been hardest hit. Our portfolio is only 7% publicly traded, and we are benefiting from the strong demand that continues for high-quality private assets, even as public market multiples are contracting. And importantly, thus far taken as a whole, the top line of the companies in our corporate private equity portfolio continue growing at double-digit rates, while maintaining operating margins.  Now turning to our credit portfolio. We are seeing resilience in the underlying performance of our assets and higher yields are driving better performance for LPs as most of our investment strategies benefit from higher rates. At this moment, credit quality remains strong, and we have not seen any notable pickup in duress or nonaccruals, although we are closely monitoring our portfolio. We actively manage all of our credit positions and are very focused on managing risk exposures and maintaining balanced risk-adjusted credit quality throughout our portfolios.  Before I hand things over to Curt, there are 5 important points to listen out for as he talks about the quarter. First, our focus remains on driving FRE growth. What we have done over the past several years to grow and change the nature of our FRE is quite frankly, underappreciated.  Just this quarter, we delivered a record $236 million of FRE, up more than 60% from last year, and we are on track to achieve our previously stated $850 million goal in FRE for the full year 2022. It's important to understand the vast amount of our fee revenue is agnostic to asset market valuations and is instead based on committed or invested capital, giving us greater visibility on the level of fees and FRE that we will earn.  Second, our deliberate effort to diversify the firm is paying off. Our earnings mix is more diversified and more resilient than ever before, and it continues to grow because we have reshaped our business to capitalize on those areas where we see attractive growth in the private markets. As a result, the largest share of our fee-earning AUM is now associated with Global Credit. Furthermore, FRE contributed 50% of DE in the first half of 2022, making our earnings stream more balanced, distributable earnings more predictable throughout different market cycles.  Third, the firm's capital formation efforts are powering us forward, even during changing dynamics for fundraising. Importantly, please listen for the impact of the Fortitude transaction and how it sets us up for the future as total capital formation for the quarter was nearly $60 billion, with the addition of the highly scalable Fortitude advisory assets under management. This includes the nearly $10 billion we raised in new capital from LPs, but more than half this amount from global credit and global investment solutions even as we continue to raise in the more traditional private equity funds.  Next, the firm is operating from a position of financial strength. We have a nominal level of net debt. Our dividend is comfortably covered by our sustainable FRE, and our balance sheet is positioned to help us to continue to grow. Add to this over $2 billion in investments and more than $4 billion in net accrued carry and our balance sheet today comprises over $16 per share in value.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly from my perspective, we are executing against our strategic plan and delivering on what we told you we would do. Compared to just 2 years ago, Carlyle is more diversified, growing faster and more profitable.  My job as CEO is to make sure we stay focused on the right priorities, develop our people and shape our culture. We are doing just that. Putting all this together, we believe we are positioned well to navigate through a period of increasing market uncertainty and complexity and have confidence in our ability to deliver long-term earnings growth and shareholder value.  With that, over to you, Curt.\nCurtis Buser: Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. As Kew highlighted, we delivered strong results this quarter, driven by the solid relative performance of our funds, increasing diversity of our earning streams and the significant impact from our recently closed strategic transactions.  I want to focus my remarks on 3 areas: first, fee-related earnings and overall distributable earnings have had a strong start to the year, highlighting an increasingly diverse business mix and better balance between FRE and performance income; second, our global investment platform performed well, and we continue to have a record level of net accrued performance revenues; and third, our global credit business took a major step forward in assets under management and earnings power, and we continue to see opportunities for further growth and performance.  Let's begin by discussing the strength of our second quarter results and more broadly, the first half of 2022 by highlighting a few important metrics. First, fee-related earnings were a record $236 million in the second quarter, up 60% year-over-year with substantial growth in Global Credit and global private equity. Our fee-related earnings margin reached a record 40% in the second quarter and 38% in the first half, up from 33% in full year 2021. Distributable earnings of $529 million increased more than 34% from last year, and our earnings stream reflects an improving mix with fee-related earnings contributing 50% of distributable earnings in the first half of this year.  Digging into second quarter FRE, total fee revenue of $594 million increased 40% year-over-year, supported by strong organic and inorganic management fee growth as well as higher transaction fees and fee-related performance revenue. Management fees comprised almost 90% of total fee revenue for the first half and increased 24% compared to the first half of 2021.  Included in our results this quarter are $19 million in catch-up management fees, largely associated with follow-on closings in our latest U.S. buyout fund as well as several smaller GP funds. We also benefited from strong transaction fees in Global Credit, largely related to aviation and insurance solutions activity. Transaction fees and catch-up fees helped drive our record FRE margins this quarter. So it's important to note that these fees are dependent on the pace of future investment activity and fundraising. We also generated $35 million in fee-related performance revenues in the second quarter and $80 million for the first half of the year.  Looking towards the second half of 2022, GP fee-related performance revenue will likely be lower due to the construct of the Core Plus real estate fund, but will likely increase again in 2023. Global Credit fee-related performance revenues should be relatively stable.  I mentioned last quarter that you would see a material step-up in our quarterly fee-related earnings and margin owing to our recent global credit transactions, notably CBAM, which closed on March 21 and Fortitude, which closed on April 1, and that's exactly what the second quarter produced.  Global Credit FRE surged to a record $72 million, nearly triple last quarter, owing to management fee revenue from these transactions and a high level of transaction fees. Global Credit's FRE margin also nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter to 42%. While this number may vary quarter-to-quarter, we expect it to remain well above prior year margins.  Our overall DE mix continued to skew further towards a higher level of FRE even as continued realization activity supports the production of net realized performance revenues. Diversifying our earnings stream has been a deliberate effort. And for the first half of the year, FRE comprised 50% of pretax distributable earnings.  Moving on in what is a complex environment. Our portfolio continued to perform well as Kew noted, with 3% overall carry fund appreciation. Our diverse global portfolio has been carefully constructed with high-quality investments. And together with persistent exit activity, supported positive appreciation despite significant declines in public markets. Broad-based portfolio strength in infrastructure and natural resources was supported by higher energy demand and pricing.  And our real estate strategies, portfolio construction and an active disposition pipeline supported strong valuations. We also saw growth in several of our European-based private equity strategies, notably Europe growth, partially offset by weakness in our public securities, the majority of which are held in our U.S. bio strategy.  As Kew also noted earlier, the portfolio's appreciation supported yet another record level of net accrued performance revenues at $4.3 billion. This quarter's accrual was partially offset by over $270 million in net realized performance revenues, more than double the level in the first quarter. Our U.S., Asia and Europe buyout fund and U.S. real estate strategy were the biggest drivers of our net realized performance revenue this quarter.  In total, we produced nearly $400 million of net realized performance revenue in the first half of the year. In addition, we have several transactions slated to close over the next few quarters that will support performance revenues and distributable earnings.  The size and diversity of our net accrued performance balance and the quality of our investment portfolio gives us reasonable confidence we can generate an average of $1 billion of annual net realized performance revenues over the next several years, though market conditions will impact the actual level in any given year.  Moving on, I want to close with some thoughts on our global credit platform. Solid investment performance, strong fundraising and our recently completed strategic transactions drove fee-earning assets under management to $116 billion, more than double the level a year ago.  Today, the Global Credit segment is our largest source of fee-earning assets under management, and the recent transactions have provided significant scale to this business. The transformation of Global Credit over the past handful of years is remarkable.  Our opportunistic credit strategy is moving from strength to strength as it increases its scale and employs its available capital in a market that increasingly needs assurance and flexibility. Our structured credit business, with $48 billion in assets under management, following the addition of the CBAM assets, is the global market leader. They have a long-term track record of credit outperformance, and have positioned their portfolio to balance risk and reward as we head into an increasingly complex environment, which provides us with significant conviction in the earnings sustainability in the strategy.  Fortitude manages almost $50 billion in their general account, and our new advisory relationship with them positions Carlyle to scale considerably as Fortitude deploys their nearly $4 billion of excess capital. And we have growing businesses in real estate credit, infrastructure credit, direct lending and aviation, and we expect these strategies to be significantly larger in the next few years.  Broadly, credit quality in our funds remains good, and we are pleased with the diligence of our teams as they manage these portfolios in a rapidly changing environment.  In sum, in a difficult market, we posted strong results and are well positioned to deliver a solid year of distributable earnings. Our strategic transactions are performing well. Our teams are focused on managing their portfolios to deliver attractive performance for our fund investors and we have substantial dry powder to capitalize on opportunities as they emerge.  With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Kew, maybe I was hoping to start with digging a little bit more into performance trends you're seeing, particularly within Corporate Private Equity within Carlyle. Obviously, a very impressive mark this quarter in light of macro conditions and I appreciate the portfolio selection comment.  But I guess even good companies are facing higher costs and slower economic conditions and obviously, lower multiples for the public market. So just curious how you're thinking about the offsets to these factors that drove positive performance within private equity for you guys this quarter? And as you think about the exit environment and the ability to actually monetize some of these gains, how are you thinking about that for the next couple of quarters?\nKewsong Lee: Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Look, it's clearly a complex market, but we're really focused on controlling what we can control, namely our investing in how we manage our portfolios.  But I think the right way and the best way to answer your question, as I said in my opening remarks, we're more diversified than ever. And let me spend a few minutes walking through our various businesses and why I think we're so well positioned with respect to our portfolios and portfolio quality, which your question implies.  So first of all, in Corporate Private Equity, it's important to understand we've got a world-class dominant business at scale. But what's really important to appreciate is that for the several years now, Alex, we've been running slower growth in our investment cases. And importantly, virtually all of our investment base cases contemplated contraction of exit multiples. So that's what I mean when I say we've been preparing for these types of environments.  Now we've always been focused on investing in great companies with a view to create growth and fundamental operating improvements to drive our returns. So when you put all this together, we've got great constructed portfolios across all of our CPE strategies, and they're diversified across sectors, regions, themes and vintages. And it's really why we've been able to avoid the hardest hit sectors, we've avoided the high-flying companies that don't generate any profitability.  And so when you take a look at that portfolio that you referred to, -- it's -- our Corporate Private Equity portfolio, at the top line, has been growing at about 14% this year. They've been maintaining their operating margins given all of the operating improvements that I just referred to. And so the value creation is really coming from growth and operating improvements, which has offset the contraction in the valuation multiples that we've seen in the markets.  And with respect to the exit part of your question, look, you can't have good exits if you don't have good companies. Great exit starts with great investing. We pride ourselves on being a great investment firm with a great investment ethos. And so when you pick good companies, partner with them to create value in a fundamental way, it sets you up for the exits and it's just a matter of how you decide to exit given what the market and the conditions afford you.  So look, taking a step back, we're at scale. We're very well diversified in Corporate Private Equity. We've got superior portfolio construction. Thus far, it's performed relatively well because of the operating performance and the fundamental nature of our value creation.  And who knows what the future has in store for everyone moving forward, but I like the way we are positioned as we're heading into this current environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hope everyone is doing well. So we were looking to get an update on fundraising. So how crowded does the current backdrop feel to you, especially in private equity and especially with U.S. pension plans feeling the dominator effect? And then how much of this is offset by new strength from sovereign wealth funds given their stronger cash flows from higher energy prices?\nCurtis Buser: Craig, I'm going to start and just kind of level set a little bit, and then Kew will add some color. So let's just kind of recall where we were. 2021 was a great year for us. We raised $51 billion. 2/3 of that came in credit, real estate, our solutions business, infrastructure, renewables, so really diverse in terms of our capital raise.  And this year is kind of the same. We expect to have 20 or more strategies in the market this year, again, emphasizing the diversity of the platform. And we're off to a good start, $19 billion raised in the first half, $10 billion in this quarter. And what we're seeing from LPs is they're continuing to entrust us with an increasing amount of capital, which is really important in the current environment. Kew?\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Curt. Look, no doubt the fundraising market is challenging right now, and this could persist for a bit as LPs adjust to market dynamics. And it's most challenging in the corporate private equity segment of the market.  But I want to refer you to something that Curt just said. We've got 20 or more strategies in the market. And it's important -- and let me refer you to my opening remarks about the diversity of our platform and the benefits of that.  Over half of our fundraising now is coming from Global Credit, infrastructure, renewables and solutions, where we're continuing to see strong and healthy demand. And I want to broaden the conversation to that of capital formation. And you just heard us talk about it.  Just this quarter, we added $50 billion in perpetual capital from Fortitude. And so I think the point being that there are multiple ways we raise capital to drive the growth of Carlyle. We are now at about $260 billion of FE AUM, which is a record. And while there are some challenges in the private equity markets, which we expect to continue for a bit, the breadth and the diversity of our platform gives us a lot of fundraising opportunities, especially when you broaden the lens to think about a capital formation across all of our strategies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.\nChristoph Kotowski: I wanted to get a bit more color on what Curt said about fees in private equity coming down in the second half versus first half or second quarter. Is that a function of just a lower catch-up fees or is that the function of realizations coming from funds? Or what's driving that?\nCurtis Buser: Chris, thanks for the question. So to be specific, what I called out was fee-related performance revenues. So really talking about in Global Private Equity and CPE in particular, I should say, real estate, in particular, is our core+ real estate fund.  This has nothing to do with performance. I mean the fund has done really well, continues to do really well, both in terms of size, attractiveness, et cetera. And -- but what we see just based on how it's constructed, that -- it essentially generates incentive fees based upon capital when it was deployed.  So 3 years ago, in the second half of the year, 3 years ago, lower amounts of deployment then. And so the incentive fees crystallized off of that are going to be a little bit lower we expect here in the second half. And so I wanted to call that out for everybody. But I think that all solves itself over time.  And I would point you to a tiny footnote that's like back on Page 25 of our earnings release, that shows that there's $64 million of net accrued incentive fees related to this strategy. And interestingly, that's about the same number last quarter, even though we had about $12 million or so net of compensation realized here in the current quarter. So it's essentially flat and strong. And so we've got good visibility in terms of how that particular product will perform going forward.  With respect to catch-up management fees, yes, they'll dip here probably in the third quarter. Hard to predict exactly kind of how it plays out over the balance of the year, more broadly outside of the GP segment. We do have some transaction fees that were good in this quarter. And though it's hard to predict exactly when they'll come in, but I feel good about our $850 million of FRE for the full year. And that, I think, is the key that you really want to focus on.\nChristoph Kotowski: Okay. So it's not the base management fees, it's not the catch-up fees? And just as a reminder, how long do you have to raise?\nCurtis Buser: The catch-up management fees do impact. There's $19 million of catch-up management fees, and that will -- based on fundraising, that will play out. But in order to be able to say the $850 million, I'm confident in our growth in core management fees, and management fees make up 90% of our fee revenues. And they're performing really well and incredibly sticky.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Maybe the first one, just on Fortitude read I think to you called out that have there's about $4 billion of available capital. Could you kind of -- well, maybe 2 things there. Number one, what would that translate into an asset? Should we assume something like 10:1 leverage to that potentially?  And then what's the current environment, how is that altering or impacting the reinsurance opportunity with Fortitude to be in the marketplace and maybe there's different businesses that present more opportunities than others? So any color there would be very helpful.\nKewsong Lee: Robert, thanks for the question. Why don't we do this? Curt, why don't you tackle the first part of the question, then I'll try to tackle the second one.\nCurtis Buser: Yes. So Rob, I think you got it right. You picked up on really an important metric. They've got nearly $4 billion of excess capital that Fortitude's going to use to continue to grow its business. And if it does that, you're right, that translates into 10x to 15x from a size standpoint.  So as we've previously said, I think Fortitude is in great position to double its business over the next handful of years. So I'd say somewhere over the next 5 years, they're well positioned without really doing a whole lot else to double the business.\nKewsong Lee: Yes. And Robert, let me just add on to that. So first, Fortitude is performing very well. And we are exceptionally happy with how that platform is developed. It's got double-digit ROE at the moment. Reserves are in great shape. And as Curt mentioned and you rightly pointed out, it's got about $4 billion excess capital, which is incredible capital base to support future growth.  As you know, as Fortitude grows, because of our aligned strategic advisory's arrangement, as Fortitude grows, Carlyle benefits through our investment platform. With respect to the areas and sources of future growth, the current environment of volatility and higher rates, actually leads us to believe there's going to be more deal activity.  Because what that volatility does is it puts pressure on insurance companies to manage their capital more effectively. And as a result, they are going to be much more inclined to want to divest and to sell legacy liabilities, portfolios that are capital consumptive or enter into reinsurance transactions with folks like Fortitude.  So at the moment, our pipeline is very busy, very robust. You've seen us announce deals with Prudential, with T&D in Japan. And there are lots of other areas for us to continue to grow via reinsurance, but also scaling up via acquisition.  These types of things are not predictable month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, but as I look out over the next several years, this excess capital and the momentum that Fortitude has leads me to believe you're going to see real scalable growth coming out of Fortitude in the years to come.\nRobert Lee: Great. And maybe as a quick follow-up, Curt, I think you guys have guided to $850 million of FRE for this year. Can you maybe just update us on your thoughts around that, your comfort level that's still a reasonable goal?\nCurtis Buser: Yes. I mean Kew confirmed that in his prepared remarks, and we feel very comfortable with the $850 million. And again, the business is performing well. And so I think that's a good target and a good expectation for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKenneth Worthington: Kew, a couple of questions on inorganic growth. Has the environment for inorganic growth changed given market conditions? And then maybe there had been a gap between public and private market valuations, for alternative asset managers presenting a nice arbitrage opportunity for public market buyers and that arbitrage, I think, narrowed.  Have private market valuations come down with public market alternative asset manager valuations? And ultimately, what is your outlook here today for the second half of 2022 into '23 for executing the inorganic part of your growth strategy?\nKewsong Lee: Great. Let me take the first part of that question, which is the -- and then maybe Curt can jump in and give some color as well on your fulsome question.  With respect to inorganic growth, let me take a step back. Corporate development done very strategically and thoughtfully is absolutely one very important element as we continue to diversify our platform. You've seen us do this, and it has been done to great success thus far.  However, we're going to be very disciplined about it. There is no quota or budget or timetable that we're on. We're going to be very measured and deliberate. And this type of environment may create opportunities, and we are very carefully seeing what the environment has to bring, but also doing it from a perspective of where do we want to build out in our platform.  And I've told you the areas that most likely would represent areas for continued growth would most likely be in our credit and our solutions and our infrastructure platform. But the bigger theme though that needs to be appreciated is the criteria that we're looking for are strategic adjacencies, FRE intensive, ideally more perpetual capital-oriented, highly scalable, big markets, big strategies, where things can move the needle over time for us.  So these are the types of criteria we're looking forward to the extent that something fits that bill. Yes, we would be willing to move forward. But like I said, no quota time pressure or anything imminent that I want to talk about. Curt?\nCurtis Buser: Yes. Thanks. And Ken, thanks for the thoughtful question. From a valuation perspective, we're talking here about alts and possible opportunities from us from an acquisition standpoint, continuing to build inorganically.  And similar to what we see kind of in our own portfolio, it really comes down to the quality of the asset that you're looking at and really good quality assets, those valuation demands are still really high. And those things that are lacking in attributes obviously get a lower value and are under more pressure now.  And so if you think about it in terms of what we're looking at, we like things that have lots of FRE and with great margins. We like things that have a great growth trajectory. We like to see can they execute this on their own? Or are they deficient in their ability to execute? Are they scaled and what's their infrastructure and technology, et cetera? How does that kind of look? Or are they missing? And if they're missing in those things, they get a lower -- their ability to ask for an amount is lower than if they can execute on all these things.  So look, we'll often kind of look at things that only possess some of the attributes. And then the question is, can we supplement it and get an arbitrage advantage on that kind of as you pointed out, in our own analysis?  So look, it's the whole scale. I mean -- but it's a continuous discovery process between buyer and seller.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I just wanted to come back to some of your early commentary on the call here, maybe just for some on the fundraising commentary just around a more challenging backdrop for raising in private equity.  Just curious how you see that potentially impacting Carlyle's own outlook for raising and Corporate Private Equity just in terms of magnitude and timing? Does it have an impact there at all? And then to your comments on the strong portfolio appreciation in the quarter, but just given the tougher macro backdrop here, just curious how you see that impacting the realization outlook into the second half of the year as compared to the $390 million that you generated in net realizations in the first half?\nKewsong Lee: Mike, it's Kew. Why don't we try this? Curt, do you want to take the first part, and I'll take the second?\nCurtis Buser: Sure. So Michael, on fundraising, again, there's good momentum as we start this year. For all the things I've already said $19 billion raised, 20 different strategies and having very good success on a multitude of fronts.  You're absolutely right that the world has changed, in particular around some of the traditional private equity strategies. And that's fundamentally going to result in some of those raises taking longer in general and maybe not raising the same amounts as they would have otherwise in a different environment.  All of that said, I still like our play. I still like what we're doing, and I still like our momentum.\nKewsong Lee: Yes. And with respect to your second question on exits, look, I mean the general M&A environment today, the state of the equity capital markets, one -- it would lead one to think that realizations would drop down significantly.  But you got to keep in mind how big our portfolio is, how broad it is, how diversified it is. And we've had $4.3 billion of accrued carry in place for several quarters now. And there are lots of transactions that were signed up several quarters ago, 3 quarters ago, that continued to close as we play out the rest of this year.  So number one, that gives us a lot of line of sight, which is why Curt, in his comments, was fairly comfortable that year-to-year, it will be about $1 billion worth of net realized performance fees give or take for market conditions and timing and the vague reason and then whatnot. But the size and breadth of our portfolio gives us that comfort to say that.  I'd also state -- and just I want to reaffirm what I said earlier to Alex's question. We have great portfolios that have been constructed and our investment approach is always to pick out what we believe are great companies with real differentiated plans for value creation driven by fundamental -- in fundamental ways, growth and operating improvements.  I just want to point out, 80% of the IRRs in Carlyle's Corporate Private Equity portfolio, historically, are driven by growth and operating improvements, not by leverage and multiple expansion. This gives you a sense for the nature of our value creation.  Because of the way we do things in our investment ethos, we feel very good about the quality of the companies that we have in portfolio, which, of course, then leads to good exit outcomes. Thus far this year, despite the challenging markets -- and the market and the valuation multiple contraction that you've referred to, the sales of our private assets have been at very good prices, which reflects the nature of these companies and the quality of these assets.  So we feel pretty good about the construction of our portfolio. The realizations to date indicate good breadth and good quality and good portfolio construction. And longer term, if we can keep this up, I think we are pretty confident in what Curt said, which is about $1 billion a year in terms of net realized performance fees coming out of our very substantial $4.3 billion of accrued carry.\nCurtis Buser: And just to add on to that, Mike. I mean, you heard the confidence in what Kew was saying about the portfolio. And we've been seeing a lot of activity, a lot of discussions, so good exits here in the quarter. We've got a good pipeline of exits.  And sitting here today, my bet is the second half is actually stronger than the first half. Not to the same level it was last year, of course, but I think the second half from a carrier production perspective, and I don't have a perfect crystal ball, but I think the second half will be better than the first half.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. That's super helpful. So I'm hearing a lot of confidence in the pipeline, the portfolio, the receivable. I guess would you be surprised if you hit the $1 billion this year on the net carry -- realized carry?\nCurtis Buser: Look, I mean, the portfolio is incredibly well set up. I told you kind of that -- I think the second half is going to be better than the first half. So -- can we do really well? Sure. Can we miss it a little? That's always possible. So it's hard to give you an exact number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So just came out, obviously, but we've been talking about this for a year. So a quick question on management consumer seems like they struck a clean energy deal, and part of the pay for is carried interest. I'm sure I'm not alone when I got a ton of questions already this morning. I know we've talked about in the past, I think it would be good for people to hear from you.  Two-parter, a, what does it mean for your portfolios? And then most importantly, for your stocks right now, what does it mean, if anything, for the shareholder? Like who's issuing is it assuming higher carrier interest taxes goes through?\nCurtis Buser: Glenn, thanks for the question. Look, I mean, this news kind of just came out last night. There's a long way still to go on it. All of the details aren't yet. Our teams are on it, looking at it and researching it just like you would expect, but it's really premature for us to comment on it.  And look, generally, in terms of how our people -- our tax, we got people all over the world, subject to all kinds of different tax rates, that's not kind of changes in local taxation doesn't affect kind of our corporate play. And we're already at a full C-corp with a fully loaded corporate tax provision.\nGlenn Schorr: Maybe I want to -- I know it's a came out, but I know we've also talked about it for years. I think that shareholders want to know one thing. No matter what the rules are, is the public shareholder on the hook for a higher carried interest cost? Or is that the employee getting paid and carried? That's what I'm getting over.\nCurtis Buser: Yes. I mean, we're already -- our carry is already fully taxed on the corporate side. So it weren't -- capital gains rates aren't -- it's not kind of -- we're paying essentially a fully loaded ordinary income tax rate on our carry.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. That's the point I wanted to get across. Last quickie is you see these hung deals, some of us cover all the big banks, too. And forget that they took marks as music stopped. They're still holding on to a lot of inventory. There's a lot of leverage loans hung out there.  It coincides with the wider bid asks. I'm just curious just what does that mean to you? Is that fully incorporated in your comments so far on the deployment and monetization? Is there any other circumstances that, that leads to good or bad things for you?\nKewsong Lee: Glenn, it's Kew. I'll handle that question. I think it's important to take a step back and put the current situation in perspective and compare that to maybe what we're all remembering with what happened right after the great financial crisis set in.  And right now, I think my best guess is there's probably $80 billion of hung loans or backlog today in the system. But that compares to, if you go back a bit, $325 billion, which is the comparable number back at the time of the great financial crisis. But I think what's really important to appreciate is that the entire leveraged finance market is 3 to 4x bigger.  So not only is the absolute amount much smaller, but the total market is much bigger. And on top of that, my view is that our banks and our partners at all of our banks, If they're well capitalized, they're well run.  So yes, there is a backlog today that they're trying to move off their books. I have no doubt that's going to happen in time. It is a much smaller issue and headache now than it was at the GFC. And it's just a matter of time before this clears out, and hopefully, activity resumes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rufus Hone with Bank of Montreal.\nRufus Hone: I was hoping you could provide an update on the solutions business. And how do you see activity there developing in the coming quarters? And whether the dislocation you're seeing in the markets translates into potential upside for that business? And can you also update us on potential fundraising opportunities in solutions and the pipeline for new products?\nCurtis Buser: Rufus, let me start, and maybe Kew will add in. So look, the solutions business, we remain optimistic and bullish there. Lots of good things happening. As I said, probably last quarter, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. It is still a little bit of a stair-step business.  So as it's -- cycles of funds come back to market, it grows a little bit more in stair-step. Second, that business has made real progress in terms of improving its performance and margin. It got hurt a little bit this quarter in terms of FX. It's one of the places where we're probably a little bit more exposed to FX because most of that business -- a lot of it is denominated in euros and the like. And so as the dollar strengthens, it's hurt us a little bit on some of that.  But overall trajectory is good. There's also a white space there that they're taking advantage of and the potential to add new products that they're very much focused on. And so looking forward to some of that, that will take some time to really play out.  But it gives me a lot of confidence in long-term growth. And I think that's where this business can go. And then last, I'll simply say that the secondary market -- I mean now it's a great time for it. And so they're continuing to take advantage of that and play well. They're a very well-known player. AlpInvest has done a great job. Their knowledge of data and of the market is fabulous. Their performance here in the quarter aided a little bit -- I hear it helps us. It aided a little bit by FX, but still remains very strong and their knowledge of what's happening is very good. So we're well set up there, especially for the long term.\nKewsong Lee: Yes. I don't have much to add, Curt, other than if you string together a few of these questions, the volatility, the denominator effect that somebody mentioned on a previous question, all of this leads our LPs to want to optimize, reconstruct and tailor their very large alternatives portfolios and that need, that necessity for the LPs to do that really runs right into the sweet spot of what AlpInvest is designed to help our LPs do.  So whether it's secondaries, whether it's single asset strategies, whether it's co-investment strategies, AlpInvest is very well positioned as a market leader to take advantage of this more broad secular trend that all this volatility, all of the multiple contractions and the swings you're seeing, our LPs need to optimize and tinker with their portfolio at large levels. And that, I think, is going to continue for several years to the benefit of our AlpInvest platform.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Alexander Blostein.\nAlexander Blostein: I wanted to go back to the FRE dynamics you described for this year, and it's really nice to hear, obviously, the reaffirmation of the $850 million of FRE for 2022.  But as you think about Carlyle's growth algorithm for FRE beyond this year, obviously, you're going to get the benefit from annualization from some of the deals and kind of the big flagship fundraising. So that will help.  But curious how you would think about growth and FRE besides these tailwinds for 2023? I understand it's kind of early. I don't expect you guys to have full guidance out. But just as a framework of how to think about beyond some of these annualization dynamics?\nCurtis Buser: Alex, I'll start and Kew may add in here. So look, we've done really well in terms of growing the business, especially over the last several years. We've taken FRE and if you think about over the last 5 years, we've more than tripled fee-related earnings.  If you do the math, and that's about a 30% CAGR over that time period. At the 8 50, we'll end the year up about 40% over last year. Big market picture. If markets -- everything we're reading and what we've experienced, I would say that the private markets will go from about a $10 trillion size to about double that over 4 or 5 years, which would imply about a 15% CAGR.  If that all happens, we'll be right there with it. I mean our brand, our diversity, our strength of performance really sets us up to really benefit from all of those tailwinds. And I think that we can do better, especially as we use our balance sheet and grow new products. There's more things that we can do.  But to be determined in terms of kind of how all those things shape up over time, and we'll see how it plays. But I like where we've been and what we've been able to do, and we remain focused on growing the business.\nKewsong Lee: Yes, Alex, let me give you a few thoughts, and it ties into the fact that we have deliberately diversified our platform to create meaningful platforms that can continue to scale growth and give us many avenues to drive growth and earnings over time.  So just taking a step back, I just want to remind you, obviously, we have a world-class dominant Corporate Private Equity business. It's global in scale. It cuts across all industries. And I've got no doubt that business will continue to motor along.  In addition to that, we've now supplemented it by organically and with some inorganic help, we've built a great credit business. It's now the fastest-growing part of our business. It is a more scalable asset class than private equity. And even within credit, we see white space in areas like infrastructure credit, real estate credit to continue growing.  And just want to remind you, we've had great success in our opportunistic strategy, which we started from scratch. And our aviation platform has more than doubled since we bought it. So credit is a great platform that we believe still has real secular tailwinds, especially, as I've noticed, our LPs continue to allocate away from traditional public fixed income into private credit and especially since we continue to see inroads of private credit solutions from that of the banking system.  The third major business we have set up is now our infrastructure and renewables business, which I believe will really benefit from the secular tailwinds of energy transition, but also the significant investment dollars that around the world that have to go to improving infrastructure, whether it's digital infrastructure, hard infrastructure, countries are going to have to be rebuilt. You are talking about significant amounts of capital that's going to be required in infrastructure support energy transition and the creation of resilience on a regional level in our industrial complex.  So there's going to be a lot of money and a lot of growth in infrastructure. Then we just talked about our solutions business. AlpInvest is an industry-leading platform. As the alt industry grows, there's just going to be even more need for AlpInvest to help our LPs with their portfolio management solutions.  We talked earlier about Fortitude, $50 billion of assets already. It's got excess capital. That is set up really nicely to scale and grow. And then don't forget, we have set up a capital markets business which, as our deal activity continues to pick up across our platform, we'll continue to drop incremental fees to our bottom line.  So all of that has been set up over the past few years. It is a much more diversified platform. It creates a much more resilient earnings base, but we have lots of areas by which to grow moving forward. And that's even before we talk about corporate development and inorganic initiatives, which obviously, over the past couple of years in selective ways we've done it, have been very select -- successful and additive.  So if you marry Curt's thoughts, bigger picture where the industry is going. And then if you marry that with what we've been doing to execute against our strategic priorities and set up a diversified platform for growth, I kind of like the way we're positioned to keep driving this firm moving forward.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Craig Siegenthaler.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I'm assuming this is not an issue just given your commentary on the resilient credit quality in your Global Credit business. But I'm curious in terms of how your CLO managed fee deferrals work? And can you help us frame the risk that you might have a decline in management fees if we enter a severe U.S. economic recession?\nCurtis Buser: Craig, thanks for the question. Look, we're now the largest player in the CLO space, and that gives us a lot of opportunity and strength. The portfolio is exceptionally well positioned. And the team has been incredibly active in terms of how to position the portfolio for these challenging times.  So they traded about $9 billion and that was all buys and sells across the platform here in the second quarter. And with the goal of reducing exposure to industries that had higher commodity costs or little pricing power. So it was all about making sure that we really kind of positioned it well for some potential rough waters.  As a result, the risk metrics look really good. Our exposures on CCCs are below industry averages in the index. The quality of the portfolios and all of the basic indexes have scored well and are rating really well from a quality perspective. Our defaults continue to be below market averages.  Look, we expect some kind of increase in that. But the underlying cushion in the overcollateralization test is strong. So we feel like really well positioned. And as long as that remains so, which we currently expect it to be, there's not really the risk in terms of any of the sub fees shutting off. The portfolio is well positioned and hence the confidence you've heard in our tone.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back now for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for listening on what I know is a very busy day. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Otherwise, we look forward to talking with you again in the fall. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Carlyle once again delivered strong results for the second quarter. We continue to drive growth and diversify the earnings power of our business. And importantly, our investment performance remained strong amidst the volatility and uncertainty in markets around the world. All of this is a result of clear strategic priorities and the hard work of our teams globally.  We're in a much different environment as inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty affect the real economy and financial markets. At Carlyle, we have been preparing for this complex and challenging environment, which is likely to continue in the near term. We are focused on continuously assessing risk, recalibrating valuations and capturing opportunities as we move forward.  The strength of our diversified platform, well-constructed portfolios and over $80 billion of dry powder positions us well as we have deliberately built Carlyle into a more resilient firm that is set up to adapt and manage through all types of market conditions. We are a different firm today and better positioned than ever before as we drive forward from a position of strength.  Given the environment, we know that questions about our portfolio are top of mind, so allow me to address this topic before we get into the point we'd like to discuss today. Thus far, portfolios across the firm continued to perform exceptionally well. Our focus on investment excellence and the diversification of our platform are supporting the firm's relative outperformance, with Carlyle's aggregate carry fund portfolio appreciating 3% in the second quarter, while various public benchmarks were down 10% to 20%. I'll provide some perspective, and Curt will drill into more specifics.  Our global private equity portfolio appreciated 2%, driven by strength in infrastructure and natural resources and real estate and flat performance in corporate private equity. Throughout the GPE segment, our overarching view is that we have well-constructed and well-positioned portfolios. Our approach has been always to invest in good assets and established companies led by strong management teams that have a differentiated path for growth and value creation.  As a result, we have avoided the sectors that have been hardest hit. Our portfolio is only 7% publicly traded, and we are benefiting from the strong demand that continues for high-quality private assets, even as public market multiples are contracting. And importantly, thus far taken as a whole, the top line of the companies in our corporate private equity portfolio continue growing at double-digit rates, while maintaining operating margins.  Now turning to our credit portfolio. We are seeing resilience in the underlying performance of our assets and higher yields are driving better performance for LPs as most of our investment strategies benefit from higher rates. At this moment, credit quality remains strong, and we have not seen any notable pickup in duress or nonaccruals, although we are closely monitoring our portfolio. We actively manage all of our credit positions and are very focused on managing risk exposures and maintaining balanced risk-adjusted credit quality throughout our portfolios.  Before I hand things over to Curt, there are 5 important points to listen out for as he talks about the quarter. First, our focus remains on driving FRE growth. What we have done over the past several years to grow and change the nature of our FRE is quite frankly, underappreciated.  Just this quarter, we delivered a record $236 million of FRE, up more than 60% from last year, and we are on track to achieve our previously stated $850 million goal in FRE for the full year 2022. It's important to understand the vast amount of our fee revenue is agnostic to asset market valuations and is instead based on committed or invested capital, giving us greater visibility on the level of fees and FRE that we will earn.  Second, our deliberate effort to diversify the firm is paying off. Our earnings mix is more diversified and more resilient than ever before, and it continues to grow because we have reshaped our business to capitalize on those areas where we see attractive growth in the private markets. As a result, the largest share of our fee-earning AUM is now associated with Global Credit. Furthermore, FRE contributed 50% of DE in the first half of 2022, making our earnings stream more balanced, distributable earnings more predictable throughout different market cycles.  Third, the firm's capital formation efforts are powering us forward, even during changing dynamics for fundraising. Importantly, please listen for the impact of the Fortitude transaction and how it sets us up for the future as total capital formation for the quarter was nearly $60 billion, with the addition of the highly scalable Fortitude advisory assets under management. This includes the nearly $10 billion we raised in new capital from LPs, but more than half this amount from global credit and global investment solutions even as we continue to raise in the more traditional private equity funds.  Next, the firm is operating from a position of financial strength. We have a nominal level of net debt. Our dividend is comfortably covered by our sustainable FRE, and our balance sheet is positioned to help us to continue to grow. Add to this over $2 billion in investments and more than $4 billion in net accrued carry and our balance sheet today comprises over $16 per share in value.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly from my perspective, we are executing against our strategic plan and delivering on what we told you we would do. Compared to just 2 years ago, Carlyle is more diversified, growing faster and more profitable.  My job as CEO is to make sure we stay focused on the right priorities, develop our people and shape our culture. We are doing just that. Putting all this together, we believe we are positioned well to navigate through a period of increasing market uncertainty and complexity and have confidence in our ability to deliver long-term earnings growth and shareholder value.  With that, over to you, Curt. Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Look, it's clearly a complex market, but we're really focused on controlling what we can control, namely our investing in how we manage our portfolios.  But I think the right way and the best way to answer your question, as I said in my opening remarks, we're more diversified than ever. And let me spend a few minutes walking through our various businesses and why I think we're so well positioned with respect to our portfolios and portfolio quality, which your question implies.  So first of all, in Corporate Private Equity, it's important to understand we've got a world-class dominant business at scale. But what's really important to appreciate is that for the several years now, Alex, we've been running slower growth in our investment cases. And importantly, virtually all of our investment base cases contemplated contraction of exit multiples. So that's what I mean when I say we've been preparing for these types of environments.  Now we've always been focused on investing in great companies with a view to create growth and fundamental operating improvements to drive our returns. So when you put all this together, we've got great constructed portfolios across all of our CPE strategies, and they're diversified across sectors, regions, themes and vintages. And it's really why we've been able to avoid the hardest hit sectors, we've avoided the high-flying companies that don't generate any profitability.  And so when you take a look at that portfolio that you referred to, -- it's -- our Corporate Private Equity portfolio, at the top line, has been growing at about 14% this year. They've been maintaining their operating margins given all of the operating improvements that I just referred to. And so the value creation is really coming from growth and operating improvements, which has offset the contraction in the valuation multiples that we've seen in the markets.  And with respect to the exit part of your question, look, you can't have good exits if you don't have good companies. Great exit starts with great investing. We pride ourselves on being a great investment firm with a great investment ethos. And so when you pick good companies, partner with them to create value in a fundamental way, it sets you up for the exits and it's just a matter of how you decide to exit given what the market and the conditions afford you.  So look, taking a step back, we're at scale. We're very well diversified in Corporate Private Equity. We've got superior portfolio construction. Thus far, it's performed relatively well because of the operating performance and the fundamental nature of our value creation.  And who knows what the future has in store for everyone moving forward, but I like the way we are positioned as we're heading into this current environment. Thanks, Curt. Look, no doubt the fundraising market is challenging right now, and this could persist for a bit as LPs adjust to market dynamics. And it's most challenging in the corporate private equity segment of the market.  But I want to refer you to something that Curt just said. We've got 20 or more strategies in the market. And it's important -- and let me refer you to my opening remarks about the diversity of our platform and the benefits of that.  Over half of our fundraising now is coming from Global Credit, infrastructure, renewables and solutions, where we're continuing to see strong and healthy demand. And I want to broaden the conversation to that of capital formation. And you just heard us talk about it.  Just this quarter, we added $50 billion in perpetual capital from Fortitude. And so I think the point being that there are multiple ways we raise capital to drive the growth of Carlyle. We are now at about $260 billion of FE AUM, which is a record. And while there are some challenges in the private equity markets, which we expect to continue for a bit, the breadth and the diversity of our platform gives us a lot of fundraising opportunities, especially when you broaden the lens to think about a capital formation across all of our strategies. Robert, thanks for the question. Why don't we do this? Curt, why don't you tackle the first part of the question, then I'll try to tackle the second one. Yes. And Robert, let me just add on to that. So first, Fortitude is performing very well. And we are exceptionally happy with how that platform is developed. It's got double-digit ROE at the moment. Reserves are in great shape. And as Curt mentioned and you rightly pointed out, it's got about $4 billion excess capital, which is incredible capital base to support future growth.  As you know, as Fortitude grows, because of our aligned strategic advisory's arrangement, as Fortitude grows, Carlyle benefits through our investment platform. With respect to the areas and sources of future growth, the current environment of volatility and higher rates, actually leads us to believe there's going to be more deal activity.  Because what that volatility does is it puts pressure on insurance companies to manage their capital more effectively. And as a result, they are going to be much more inclined to want to divest and to sell legacy liabilities, portfolios that are capital consumptive or enter into reinsurance transactions with folks like Fortitude.  So at the moment, our pipeline is very busy, very robust. You've seen us announce deals with Prudential, with T&D in Japan. And there are lots of other areas for us to continue to grow via reinsurance, but also scaling up via acquisition.  These types of things are not predictable month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, but as I look out over the next several years, this excess capital and the momentum that Fortitude has leads me to believe you're going to see real scalable growth coming out of Fortitude in the years to come. Great. Let me take the first part of that question, which is the -- and then maybe Curt can jump in and give some color as well on your fulsome question.  With respect to inorganic growth, let me take a step back. Corporate development done very strategically and thoughtfully is absolutely one very important element as we continue to diversify our platform. You've seen us do this, and it has been done to great success thus far.  However, we're going to be very disciplined about it. There is no quota or budget or timetable that we're on. We're going to be very measured and deliberate. And this type of environment may create opportunities, and we are very carefully seeing what the environment has to bring, but also doing it from a perspective of where do we want to build out in our platform.  And I've told you the areas that most likely would represent areas for continued growth would most likely be in our credit and our solutions and our infrastructure platform. But the bigger theme though that needs to be appreciated is the criteria that we're looking for are strategic adjacencies, FRE intensive, ideally more perpetual capital-oriented, highly scalable, big markets, big strategies, where things can move the needle over time for us.  So these are the types of criteria we're looking forward to the extent that something fits that bill. Yes, we would be willing to move forward. But like I said, no quota time pressure or anything imminent that I want to talk about. Curt? Mike, it's Kew. Why don't we try this? Curt, do you want to take the first part, and I'll take the second? Yes. And with respect to your second question on exits, look, I mean the general M&A environment today, the state of the equity capital markets, one -- it would lead one to think that realizations would drop down significantly.  But you got to keep in mind how big our portfolio is, how broad it is, how diversified it is. And we've had $4.3 billion of accrued carry in place for several quarters now. And there are lots of transactions that were signed up several quarters ago, 3 quarters ago, that continued to close as we play out the rest of this year.  So number one, that gives us a lot of line of sight, which is why Curt, in his comments, was fairly comfortable that year-to-year, it will be about $1 billion worth of net realized performance fees give or take for market conditions and timing and the vague reason and then whatnot. But the size and breadth of our portfolio gives us that comfort to say that.  I'd also state -- and just I want to reaffirm what I said earlier to Alex's question. We have great portfolios that have been constructed and our investment approach is always to pick out what we believe are great companies with real differentiated plans for value creation driven by fundamental -- in fundamental ways, growth and operating improvements.  I just want to point out, 80% of the IRRs in Carlyle's Corporate Private Equity portfolio, historically, are driven by growth and operating improvements, not by leverage and multiple expansion. This gives you a sense for the nature of our value creation.  Because of the way we do things in our investment ethos, we feel very good about the quality of the companies that we have in portfolio, which, of course, then leads to good exit outcomes. Thus far this year, despite the challenging markets -- and the market and the valuation multiple contraction that you've referred to, the sales of our private assets have been at very good prices, which reflects the nature of these companies and the quality of these assets.  So we feel pretty good about the construction of our portfolio. The realizations to date indicate good breadth and good quality and good portfolio construction. And longer term, if we can keep this up, I think we are pretty confident in what Curt said, which is about $1 billion a year in terms of net realized performance fees coming out of our very substantial $4.3 billion of accrued carry. Glenn, it's Kew. I'll handle that question. I think it's important to take a step back and put the current situation in perspective and compare that to maybe what we're all remembering with what happened right after the great financial crisis set in.  And right now, I think my best guess is there's probably $80 billion of hung loans or backlog today in the system. But that compares to, if you go back a bit, $325 billion, which is the comparable number back at the time of the great financial crisis. But I think what's really important to appreciate is that the entire leveraged finance market is 3 to 4x bigger.  So not only is the absolute amount much smaller, but the total market is much bigger. And on top of that, my view is that our banks and our partners at all of our banks, If they're well capitalized, they're well run.  So yes, there is a backlog today that they're trying to move off their books. I have no doubt that's going to happen in time. It is a much smaller issue and headache now than it was at the GFC. And it's just a matter of time before this clears out, and hopefully, activity resumes. Yes. I don't have much to add, Curt, other than if you string together a few of these questions, the volatility, the denominator effect that somebody mentioned on a previous question, all of this leads our LPs to want to optimize, reconstruct and tailor their very large alternatives portfolios and that need, that necessity for the LPs to do that really runs right into the sweet spot of what AlpInvest is designed to help our LPs do.  So whether it's secondaries, whether it's single asset strategies, whether it's co-investment strategies, AlpInvest is very well positioned as a market leader to take advantage of this more broad secular trend that all this volatility, all of the multiple contractions and the swings you're seeing, our LPs need to optimize and tinker with their portfolio at large levels. And that, I think, is going to continue for several years to the benefit of our AlpInvest platform. Yes, Alex, let me give you a few thoughts, and it ties into the fact that we have deliberately diversified our platform to create meaningful platforms that can continue to scale growth and give us many avenues to drive growth and earnings over time.  So just taking a step back, I just want to remind you, obviously, we have a world-class dominant Corporate Private Equity business. It's global in scale. It cuts across all industries. And I've got no doubt that business will continue to motor along.  In addition to that, we've now supplemented it by organically and with some inorganic help, we've built a great credit business.

We talked earlier about Fortitude, $50 billion of assets already. It's got excess capital. That is set up really nicely to scale and grow. And then don't forget, we have set up a capital markets business which, as our deal activity continues to pick up across our platform, we'll continue to drop incremental fees to our bottom line.  So all of that has been set up over the past few years. It is a much more diversified platform. It creates a much more resilient earnings base, but we have lots of areas by which to grow moving forward. And that's even before we talk about corporate development and inorganic initiatives, which obviously, over the past couple of years in selective ways we've done it, have been very select -- successful and additive.  So if you marry Curt's thoughts, bigger picture where the industry is going. And then if you marry that with what we've been doing to execute against our strategic priorities and set up a diversified platform for growth, I kind of like the way we're positioned to keep driving this firm moving forward."

            "content": "Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. As Kew highlighted, we delivered strong results this quarter, driven by the solid relative performance of our funds, increasing diversity of our earning streams and the significant impact from our recently closed strategic transactions.  I want to focus my remarks on 3 areas: first, fee-related earnings and overall distributable earnings have had a strong start to the year, highlighting an increasingly diverse business mix and better balance between FRE and performance income; second, our global investment platform performed well, and we continue to have a record level of net accrued performance revenues; and third, our global credit business took a major step forward in assets under management and earnings power, and we continue to see opportunities for further growth and performance.  Let's begin by discussing the strength of our second quarter results and more broadly, the first half of 2022 by highlighting a few important metrics. First, fee-related earnings were a record $236 million in the second quarter, up 60% year-over-year with substantial growth in Global Credit and global private equity. Our fee-related earnings margin reached a record 40% in the second quarter and 38% in the first half, up from 33% in full year 2021. Distributable earnings of $529 million increased more than 34% from last year, and our earnings stream reflects an improving mix with fee-related earnings contributing 50% of distributable earnings in the first half of this year.  Digging into second quarter FRE, total fee revenue of $594 million increased 40% year-over-year, supported by strong organic and inorganic management fee growth as well as higher transaction fees and fee-related performance revenue. Management fees comprised almost 90% of total fee revenue for the first half and increased 24% compared to the first half of 2021.  Included in our results this quarter are $19 million in catch-up management fees, largely associated with follow-on closings in our latest U.S. buyout fund as well as several smaller GP funds. We also benefited from strong transaction fees in Global Credit, largely related to aviation and insurance solutions activity. Transaction fees and catch-up fees helped drive our record FRE margins this quarter. So it's important to note that these fees are dependent on the pace of future investment activity and fundraising. We also generated $35 million in fee-related performance revenues in the second quarter and $80 million for the first half of the year.  Looking towards the second half of 2022, GP fee-related performance revenue will likely be lower due to the construct of the Core Plus real estate fund, but will likely increase again in 2023. Global Credit fee-related performance revenues should be relatively stable.  I mentioned last quarter that you would see a material step-up in our quarterly fee-related earnings and margin owing to our recent global credit transactions, notably CBAM, which closed on March 21 and Fortitude, which closed on April 1, and that's exactly what the second quarter produced.  Global Credit FRE surged to a record $72 million, nearly triple last quarter, owing to management fee revenue from these transactions and a high level of transaction fees. Global Credit's FRE margin also nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter to 42%. While this number may vary quarter-to-quarter, we expect it to remain well above prior year margins.  Our overall DE mix continued to skew further towards a higher level of FRE even as continued realization activity supports the production of net realized performance revenues. Diversifying our earnings stream has been a deliberate effort. And for the first half of the year, FRE comprised 50% of pretax distributable earnings.  Moving on in what is a complex environment. Our portfolio continued to perform well as Kew noted, with 3% overall carry fund appreciation. Our diverse global portfolio has been carefully constructed with high-quality investments. And together with persistent exit activity, supported positive appreciation despite significant declines in public markets. Broad-based portfolio strength in infrastructure and natural resources was supported by higher energy demand and pricing.  And our real estate strategies, portfolio construction and an active disposition pipeline supported strong valuations. We also saw growth in several of our European-based private equity strategies, notably Europe growth, partially offset by weakness in our public securities, the majority of which are held in our U.S. bio strategy.  As Kew also noted earlier, the portfolio's appreciation supported yet another record level of net accrued performance revenues at $4.3 billion. This quarter's accrual was partially offset by over $270 million in net realized performance revenues, more than double the level in the first quarter. Our U.S., Asia and Europe buyout fund and U.S. real estate strategy were the biggest drivers of our net realized performance revenue this quarter.  In total, we produced nearly $400 million of net realized performance revenue in the first half of the year. In addition, we have several transactions slated to close over the next few quarters that will support performance revenues and distributable earnings.  The size and diversity of our net accrued performance balance and the quality of our investment portfolio gives us reasonable confidence we can generate an average of $1 billion of annual net realized performance revenues over the next several years, though market conditions will impact the actual level in any given year.  Moving on, I want to close with some thoughts on our global credit platform. Solid investment performance, strong fundraising and our recently completed strategic transactions drove fee-earning assets under management to $116 billion, more than double the level a year ago.  Today, the Global Credit segment is our largest source of fee-earning assets under management, and the recent transactions have provided significant scale to this business. The transformation of Global Credit over the past handful of years is remarkable.  Our opportunistic credit strategy is moving from strength to strength as it increases its scale and employs its available capital in a market that increasingly needs assurance and flexibility. Our structured credit business, with $48 billion in assets under management, following the addition of the CBAM assets, is the global market leader. They have a long-term track record of credit outperformance, and have positioned their portfolio to balance risk and reward as we head into an increasingly complex environment, which provides us with significant conviction in the earnings sustainability in the strategy.  Fortitude manages almost $50 billion in their general account, and our new advisory relationship with them positions Carlyle to scale considerably as Fortitude deploys their nearly $4 billion of excess capital. And we have growing businesses in real estate credit, infrastructure credit, direct lending and aviation, and we expect these strategies to be significantly larger in the next few years.  Broadly, credit quality in our funds remains good, and we are pleased with the diligence of our teams as they manage these portfolios in a rapidly changing environment.  In sum, in a difficult market, we posted strong results and are well positioned to deliver a solid year of distributable earnings. Our strategic transactions are performing well. Our teams are focused on managing their portfolios to deliver attractive performance for our fund investors and we have substantial dry powder to capitalize on opportunities as they emerge.  With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Craig, I'm going to start and just kind of level set a little bit, and then Kew will add some color. So let's just kind of recall where we were. 2021 was a great year for us. We raised $51 billion. 2/3 of that came in credit, real estate, our solutions business, infrastructure, renewables, so really diverse in terms of our capital raise.  And this year is kind of the same. We expect to have 20 or more strategies in the market this year, again, emphasizing the diversity of the platform. And we're off to a good start, $19 billion raised in the first half, $10 billion in this quarter. And what we're seeing from LPs is they're continuing to entrust us with an increasing amount of capital, which is really important in the current environment. Kew? Chris, thanks for the question. So to be specific, what I called out was fee-related performance revenues. So really talking about in Global Private Equity and CPE in particular, I should say, real estate, in particular, is our core+ real estate fund.  This has nothing to do with performance. I mean the fund has done really well, continues to do really well, both in terms of size, attractiveness, et cetera. And -- but what we see just based on how it's constructed, that -- it essentially generates incentive fees based upon capital when it was deployed.  So 3 years ago, in the second half of the year, 3 years ago, lower amounts of deployment then. And so the incentive fees crystallized off of that are going to be a little bit lower we expect here in the second half. And so I wanted to call that out for everybody. But I think that all solves itself over time.  And I would point you to a tiny footnote that's like back on Page 25 of our earnings release, that shows that there's $64 million of net accrued incentive fees related to this strategy. And interestingly, that's about the same number last quarter, even though we had about $12 million or so net of compensation realized here in the current quarter. So it's essentially flat and strong. And so we've got good visibility in terms of how that particular product will perform going forward.  With respect to catch-up management fees, yes, they'll dip here probably in the third quarter. Hard to predict exactly kind of how it plays out over the balance of the year, more broadly outside of the GP segment. We do have some transaction fees that were good in this quarter. And though it's hard to predict exactly when they'll come in, but I feel good about our $850 million of FRE for the full year. And that, I think, is the key that you really want to focus on. The catch-up management fees do impact. There's $19 million of catch-up management fees, and that will -- based on fundraising, that will play out. But in order to be able to say the $850 million, I'm confident in our growth in core management fees, and management fees make up 90% of our fee revenues. And they're performing really well and incredibly sticky. Yes. So Rob, I think you got it right. You picked up on really an important metric. They've got nearly $4 billion of excess capital that Fortitude's going to use to continue to grow its business. And if it does that, you're right, that translates into 10x to 15x from a size standpoint.  So as we've previously said, I think Fortitude is in great position to double its business over the next handful of years. So I'd say somewhere over the next 5 years, they're well positioned without really doing a whole lot else to double the business. Yes. I mean Kew confirmed that in his prepared remarks, and we feel very comfortable with the $850 million. And again, the business is performing well. And so I think that's a good target and a good expectation for us. Yes. Thanks. And Ken, thanks for the thoughtful question. From a valuation perspective, we're talking here about alts and possible opportunities from us from an acquisition standpoint, continuing to build inorganically.  And similar to what we see kind of in our own portfolio, it really comes down to the quality of the asset that you're looking at and really good quality assets, those valuation demands are still really high. And those things that are lacking in attributes obviously get a lower value and are under more pressure now.  And so if you think about it in terms of what we're looking at, we like things that have lots of FRE and with great margins. We like things that have a great growth trajectory. We like to see can they execute this on their own? Or are they deficient in their ability to execute? Are they scaled and what's their infrastructure and technology, et cetera? How does that kind of look? Or are they missing? And if they're missing in those things, they get a lower -- their ability to ask for an amount is lower than if they can execute on all these things.  So look, we'll often kind of look at things that only possess some of the attributes. And then the question is, can we supplement it and get an arbitrage advantage on that kind of as you pointed out, in our own analysis?  So look, it's the whole scale. I mean -- but it's a continuous discovery process between buyer and seller. Sure. So Michael, on fundraising, again, there's good momentum as we start this year. For all the things I've already said $19 billion raised, 20 different strategies and having very good success on a multitude of fronts.  You're absolutely right that the world has changed, in particular around some of the traditional private equity strategies. And that's fundamentally going to result in some of those raises taking longer in general and maybe not raising the same amounts as they would have otherwise in a different environment.  All of that said, I still like our play. I still like what we're doing, and I still like our momentum. And just to add on to that, Mike. I mean, you heard the confidence in what Kew was saying about the portfolio. And we've been seeing a lot of activity, a lot of discussions, so good exits here in the quarter. We've got a good pipeline of exits.  And sitting here today, my bet is the second half is actually stronger than the first half. Not to the same level it was last year, of course, but I think the second half from a carrier production perspective, and I don't have a perfect crystal ball, but I think the second half will be better than the first half. Look, I mean, the portfolio is incredibly well set up. I told you kind of that -- I think the second half is going to be better than the first half. So -- can we do really well? Sure. Can we miss it a little? That's always possible. So it's hard to give you an exact number. Glenn, thanks for the question. Look, I mean, this news kind of just came out last night. There's a long way still to go on it. All of the details aren't yet. Our teams are on it, looking at it and researching it just like you would expect, but it's really premature for us to comment on it.  And look, generally, in terms of how our people -- our tax, we got people all over the world, subject to all kinds of different tax rates, that's not kind of changes in local taxation doesn't affect kind of our corporate play. And we're already at a full C-corp with a fully loaded corporate tax provision. Yes. I mean, we're already -- our carry is already fully taxed on the corporate side. So it weren't -- capital gains rates aren't -- it's not kind of -- we're paying essentially a fully loaded ordinary income tax rate on our carry. Rufus, let me start, and maybe Kew will add in. So look, the solutions business, we remain optimistic and bullish there. Lots of good things happening. As I said, probably last quarter, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. It is still a little bit of a stair-step business.  So as it's -- cycles of funds come back to market, it grows a little bit more in stair-step. Second, that business has made real progress in terms of improving its performance and margin. It got hurt a little bit this quarter in terms of FX. It's one of the places where we're probably a little bit more exposed to FX because most of that business -- a lot of it is denominated in euros and the like. And so as the dollar strengthens, it's hurt us a little bit on some of that.  But overall trajectory is good. There's also a white space there that they're taking advantage of and the potential to add new products that they're very much focused on. And so looking forward to some of that, that will take some time to really play out.  But it gives me a lot of confidence in long-term growth. And I think that's where this business can go. And then last, I'll simply say that the secondary market -- I mean now it's a great time for it. And so they're continuing to take advantage of that and play well. They're a very well-known player. AlpInvest has done a great job. Their knowledge of data and of the market is fabulous. Their performance here in the quarter aided a little bit -- I hear it helps us. It aided a little bit by FX, but still remains very strong and their knowledge of what's happening is very good. So we're well set up there, especially for the long term. Alex, I'll start and Kew may add in here. So look, we've done really well in terms of growing the business, especially over the last several years. We've taken FRE and if you think about over the last 5 years, we've more than tripled fee-related earnings.  If you do the math, and that's about a 30% CAGR over that time period. At the 8 50, we'll end the year up about 40% over last year. Big market picture. If markets -- everything we're reading and what we've experienced, I would say that the private markets will go from about a $10 trillion size to about double that over 4 or 5 years, which would imply about a 15% CAGR.  If that all happens, we'll be right there with it. I mean our brand, our diversity, our strength of performance really sets us up to really benefit from all of those tailwinds. And I think that we can do better, especially as we use our balance sheet and grow new products. There's more things that we can do.  But to be determined in terms of kind of how all those things shape up over time, and we'll see how it plays. But I like where we've been and what we've been able to do, and we remain focused on growing the business. Craig, thanks for the question. Look, we're now the largest player in the CLO space, and that gives us a lot of opportunity and strength. The portfolio is exceptionally well positioned. And the team has been incredibly active in terms of how to position the portfolio for these challenging times.  So they traded about $9 billion and that was all buys and sells across the platform here in the second quarter. And with the goal of reducing exposure to industries that had higher commodity costs or little pricing power. So it was all about making sure that we really kind of positioned it well for some potential rough waters.  As a result, the risk metrics look really good. Our exposures on CCCs are below industry averages in the index. The quality of the portfolios and all of the basic indexes have scored well and are rating really well from a quality perspective. Our defaults continue to be below market averages.  Look, we expect some kind of increase in that. But the underlying cushion in the overcollateralization test is strong. So we feel like really well positioned. And as long as that remains so, which we currently expect it to be, there's not really the risk in terms of any of the sub fees shutting off. The portfolio is well positioned and hence the confidence you've heard in our tone."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Carlyle Group First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Towanda. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee; and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and detailed earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.carlyle.com. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to GAAP in our earnings presentation to the extent reasonably available. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. Turning to our results. For the first quarter, we generated $183 million in fee-related earnings and $303 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $0.74. We produced net realized performance revenues of $118 million and grew our accrued carry balance to $4.3 billion. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.325 per common share. To ensure participation by all whose on the call this morning, please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue for any additional follow-ups. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Kewsong Lee. \nKewsong Lee : Thanks, Dan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're accelerating Carlyle's growth by diversifying our global business and running the firm better than ever before to drive long-term shareholder value. This strategy helped us continue to deliver for our shareholders and investors in the first quarter. Our FRE grew over 40% compared to the first quarter last year. Our leading investment platform demonstrated continued excellence as witnessed by record accrued carry balances, and we are increasingly diversified as over 2/3 of our total AUM is away from corporate private equity. We are pleased with our progress, and we will continue to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to drive further growth and diversification while maintaining investment excellence and business discipline as we navigate market and geopolitical uncertainty. The start of 2022 has been complex on many fronts, including the war in Ukraine and rising inflation and interest rates. And the world is now in a more tenuous place, specifically on our exposure to this conflict in region. Across our global portfolio and distribution platform, we have minimal direct exposure to Russia, Belarus or Ukraine and have not seen significant impact to Carlyle's business. Having said this, there are major paradigm shifts occurring, which are driving complexities and volatility in the investment environment, but Carlyle continues to perform. And importantly, our focus on thoughtful portfolio construction over the years is paying off this quarter. Our aggregate investment portfolio appreciated 5%, led by a 7% increase in global private equity, while public markets were down approximately 5%. We saw particular strength in our real estate platform with 10% appreciation and our infrastructure and natural resources platform with 19% appreciation. These were the major drivers of our net accrued performance revenue balance growing to $4.3 billion, a record level for our firm. Our credit strategies are also performing well. Our direct lending strategies are currently yielding approximately 9%, and the portfolios in our market-leading CLO business continue to have a default rate less than half the industry average. This broad-based performance across all asset classes is a testament to the value of our diversified global platform, time-tested investment approach and world-class teams. The private markets continue to outperform public markets over the long term, and our portfolios are well positioned for the current market environment. Turning to our growth and strategic plan to drive shareholder value. We're executing on what we told you and pleased with our progress. In the first quarter, we generated a record of $183 million of FRE, up 42% over the first quarter last year. This reflects the organic growth in our business over the past year and importantly, does not yet capture the impact from several strategic growth transactions we recently announced. To that end, we are also pursuing growth by repurposing balance sheet capital for strategic inorganic opportunities. On last quarter's call, we told you 2022 was going to be a breakout year for credit and insurance, 2 key areas identified for growth as part of our strategic plan, and we are already delivering on that. We're continuing to scale our global credit platform with FRE accretive acquisitions as evidenced by our recent iStar and CBAM transactions. And we also saw major milestones in insurance solutions with our $2 billion capital raise and creation of a new strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude. Our strategy in this area is differentiated, providing a real engine for growth and alignment for all stakeholders. This new agreement better aligns Carlyle's financial growth with the strategic interest of Fortitude and has significant and immediate impacts to our FRE in total AUM, which on a pro forma basis for this agreement is now approximately $375 billion. Keep in mind, with this new advisory relationship, we have a fee stream, which is more perpetual in nature and will grow as Fortitude continues to scale. Turning to fundraising, which continues to fuel our growth. In the first quarter, we raised more than $9 billion. Changing dynamics mostly related to a crowded private equity fundraising marketplace is affecting the timing of some of our private equity funds in the market, but the breadth of our platform and the strength of our brand and LP partnerships remains a differentiator for Carlyle. We continue to benefit from our diversification beyond traditional private equity as demonstrated by our second credit opportunities fund, which recently had a final close at $4.6 billion, almost twice as large as its predecessor fund as well as increasing traction within our infrastructure and renewable strategy. We have also added and launched a DISH products in Global Credit and Global Investment Solutions to meet the rising demands of investors for these asset strategies. Putting it all together, I want to underscore the real magnitude of the acceleration in FRE that we've delivered by executing against our strategy. In 2017, we delivered approximately $190 million in FRE. Last year, we reported almost $600 million. That is more than tripling our FRE in just 4 years. And now we said, we expect to deliver $850 million in FRE for 2022, which is 40% projected growth year-over-year. If we achieve that, we will have grown FRE by more than 4x in just 5 years. That is significant value creation for our shareholders. I'll end today with this. We are transforming Carlyle into a more diversified global investment firm, helping us capture growth in expanding strategic areas like global credit, infrastructure and renewables, insurance and global investment solutions, and we are doing this while building our powerful private equity business. We feel confident in our strategic plan and our ability to drive future FRE growth. Our leadership team is focused on managing through the complexities presented by the current market and geopolitical landscape, and I'd be remiss if I didn't continue to stress that this complexity and volatility also creates opportunity. We have built an increasingly diversified business mix that positions us well to continue capturing opportunities across the expanding private markets and to perform across cycles for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Curt. \nCurt Buser: Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. I want to focus on three areas in my remarks that complement Kew's comments, but also a follow up on our presentation from just a few weeks ago. First, our strong start to the year in fee-related earnings underscores the work we have done to broaden our earnings stream and provide increased balance to our distributable earnings; second, our thoughtful and differentiated portfolio construction underpins our ability to deliver strong distributable earnings; and third, we're poised for additional FRE growth, further diversifying our earnings streams. Let's begin by discussing our strong start to the year in fee-related earnings. We generated a record level of fee-related earnings, 42% higher than a year ago, and our FRE margins increased to 36%, up 500 basis points from a year ago. And all of this is before any meaningful contribution from our recently completed acquisitions that will be additive beginning next quarter. Management fees of $454 million increased 19% year-over-year with the most significant growth in global private equity and global credit, driven by solid fundraising activity and active deployment. Compared to the fourth quarter, global private equity management fees declined due to strong realization activity in the second half of 2021, alongside a step-down in Carlyle Partners VII management fees. In Global Credit, you will see a material step-up in quarterly FRE from our most recent acquisitions beginning next quarter with CBAM, which closed on March 21 and Fortitude, which closed on April 1, both adding high incremental margin FRE. In Global Private equity, FRE should continue to build throughout the year as we raise additional capital in our new buyout and growth vehicles, and we expect to see higher levels of top line fees throughout the year. This quarter, we began reporting a new line item in our non-GAAP results, which was historically reported as a component of fund management fees, fee-related performance revenue. This presentation is similar to disclosures from others in our industry. Included in this line item are regularly recurring performance revenues we earn from our perpetual products, such as our credit interval fund, CTAC, our BDCs and core-plus real estate. The latter of which accelerated meaningfully this quarter as we pass through the third anniversary of the CPI Fund. We expect to generate significant revenues in this line item every year, though certain quarters throughout the year will be higher than others. Moving on. Our portfolio performed incredibly well in the first quarter, as Kew summarized, with 5% overall appreciation. Our portfolio construction, diversity of investments and strong underlying performance of our portfolio companies more than offset the negative impact of increasing market uncertainty and the downward pressure from our public positions, which currently make up only about 10% of our portfolio. The only area where we have meaningful direct exposure to Belarus, Ukraine and Russia across our investment platform is in our credit aviation portfolio, which resulted in downward valuations in these funds for the quarter. As Kew noted, the portfolio's appreciation drove our accrued carry balance to a record $4.3 billion. To put that in perspective, our accrual is up about 35% year-over-year and has more than tripled over the past 2 years. This level of net accrued performance revenue provides us further confidence that Carlyle expects to generate our previously indicated average of $1 million of annual net realized performance revenues over the next several years dependent upon market conditions. First quarter's net realized performance revenues of $118 million was up 55% from last year's first quarter though below recent record levels and was driven by exits in our Japan buyout funds, U.S. real estate funds and our credit opportunities fund. Now as we look forward, we're off to a strong start to the year with distributable earnings this quarter up more than 40% higher than a year ago, and we have already signed several large transactions that are expected to close in the next few quarters. Adding to this growth will be the 3 transactions we discussed in March that add $120 million in annualized run rate FRE and $65 billion in both AUM and fee earning AUM. That is more than 16% in annualized FRE on a run rate basis that ends up for 40% FRE growth in 2022. That's attractive growth, highlighting both acceleration in our organic investment platform and optionality driven from strategically utilizing our balance sheet to drive inorganic growth. We are purposefully shaping our business to grow FRE, expand margins, diversify earnings and now increasingly access larger sources of perpetual capital. In sum, we're on track to grow in the short term while continuing to also invest in our longer-term growth. Our portfolio is performing well in a challenging environment, and we are moving forward with active fundraising deployment and exits across our global investment platform. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKenWorthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. There's a ton to ask. I'll limit it to one. We've seen a real increase in energy prices and the outlook for the energy business seems to have improved meaningfully from, say, 4 months ago as evidenced in part by $300 million, I think, of extra carry in your energy funds. What does this mean, if anything, for Carlyle in terms of launching new products? Like NGP XIII, a reincarnated Energy Mezz fund? You've got a real sort of expertise and reputation in debt and equity energy investing. The market's better, market environment is better. How should we think about this for Carlyle? \nKewsong Lee: Ken, it's Kew. Thanks for that question. Look, we've been very focused on energy and energy transition in particular. And you're right to note that we do have a lot of capabilities across the broad spectrum of energy and alternative forms of energy investing. So -- let me just take a step back. Our firm view is we need to invest through this period of energy transition. Our platform is very well set up to do that. We can invest in traditional carbon businesses, obviously, with a real ESG lens on it, yet we have a spectrum of products, including a very strong renewables platform. And we have all this -- supported by world-class ESG teams and an infrastructure business as we look around the world, trying to think about what's happening to the energy sector, the focus on energy security and really the need to keep investing in energy transition. So we are very well set up to invest in all the opportunities that are going to come up and down the spectrum, and we're excited about the prospects moving forward. \nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Perhaps a question on just retail. And if you could, Kew, perhaps give us a little sense of how you are -- what the firm approach is here and how you kind of see the opportunity playing out over perhaps the next couple of years? \nKewsong Lee: Sure, Gerry. Look, retail is one of several alternative channels for us in terms of capital formation, which clearly, we are paying a lot of attention to. It will be important to do that as we supplement our institutional fundraising platform. And to reiterate, just so you know, we're already raising approximately 10% to 15% of our capital from the retail channel broadly defined. Now what's important for us and how we're thinking about this is we need to access this developing channel with the appropriate product architecture. And I've said this before, it's mostly -- this channel fits really well with products out of credit, real estate and the solutions segments of our business. So for instance, we've developed a strategy, Curt mentioned it, for the retail customer called CTAC, Carlyle Tactical Private Credit Fund within Global Credit, which, without much fanfare at all, is already raising on a run rate basis, about $1 billion a year from retail, and that's before we've accessed the wirehouses, which we expect to start later this year. And of course, we've got other products we are developing to raise capital from this growing channel. Now I want to temper this with the obvious that we have to make sure our operational technology and all the regulatory issues are being considered very carefully. But no doubt, there's real long-term opportunity here given the strength of our brand. And similar to what we've done with our credit strategy, we're going to be very thoughtful and patient as we develop the right product architecture and our organizational capabilities to access capital formation successfully in this clearly attractive channel. \nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning Kew and Curt. Hope you both are doing well?\nKewsong Lee: Good morning.\nCurt Buser: Hey Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Kew I heard your prepared comments on the crowded private equity fundraising backdrop. You also may be seeing some impact from the denominator effect of lower public markets and also general client de-risking in addition to some competition. Maybe give us some color on how those three factors are impacting fundraising today? And does this just mean it's just going to take a little more time to raise funds or is there some risk that you may miss targets?\nKewsong Lee: Yes. The upshot is, I think it's more a timing issue than anything else. The demand obviously, for private market products are very strong. But let me just provide a little bit more color and some context for you. So look, over the last 12 months, we've raised $53 billion, a little more than $9 billion just this quarter. So, we do have strong momentum across our platform, and we are seeing real demand and real strength in areas like private credit, real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, and solutions. With respect to private equity, there are some changing dynamics mostly driven by the record number of funds that are coming back to market much faster than LPs thought in large part, because of the success that the private equity asset class has had over the past few years. So, this is going to result in longer time frames to traditional private equity fundraising. But taking a big step back, I think this is where the diversification that we've undergone and the breadth of our platform is so important because we have a broad array of fundraising going on across the firm any given point in time. And we really feel good if you take a step back about the products we have and the progress we're making in the market. Importantly, you just saw it, the performance we're generating consistently across cycles. And as demonstrated this quarter, it's that type of performance. The historical strength of our partnership with LPs, the strength of our brand. It's a huge differentiator for us in these types of markets. Craig, let me just add one other comment, which I think is really important, which is to take a step back and think about Carlyle and capital formation in totality. So, everyone is focused on fundraising, but keep in mind, we just acquired $65 billion of AUM between CBAM, about $15 billion and Fortitude about $50 billion. That's outside of traditional fundraising, that's $65 billion, that's seven times the amount that we fundraised this quarter. So, the point being that fundraising is just one aspect of our capital formation strategies. We're continually looking for new inflows of capital to drive our future growth.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Kew.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could just give a little bit of perspective around how you see the deployment environment shaking up? And how that opportunity set is evolving for putting capital to work? Are there more compelling deals today, or are the deals getting harder to get done because of less willing sellers, just given valuations? How is financing trending? Is that getting a sort of tougher in this volatile environment? And just overall, how is the landscape changing? And how are you adapting at Carlyle?\nKewsong Lee: Yes, the big picture is the type of issues you're raising, the complexities, actually, I think, favor platforms like ours. It's a broad platform, as you know, globally, lots of industry sector expertise. And we're across all asset strategies. So we're continually pivoting and adapting to go to where the opportunities are. In a world of \u2013 let's just start with volatility, there's higher volatility. That, for sure, is creating deal flow for us in our credit business, particularly in credit opportunities, and in our solutions business, LPs need to rebalance and re-jigger their portfolios in light of what's happening in the markets, and we are seeing increased activity levels in our solutions business. As you see rates rise, there's increasing demand for private credit strategies that are floating rate based, which the majority of our strategies are in our private credit business. So we're seeing real demand for direct lending for CLO business, and that's all quite positive. As it relates to private equity, I referred to this in other commentary, but \u2013 but there was a slight pause in M&A activity, which was everybody thought, buyers and sellers were taking a step back to recalibrate in light of the obvious environmental issues. But we are seeing that activity come back pipelines are about as full as ever. And I really like the architecture of our private equity business because in a world, Mike, that's decoupling, our strong Asia platform, Europe platform, Americas platform, Japan platform, really plays to our advantage because we have deep local teams that have already been set up within the regions. So as regionalization occurs and regional ecosystems become more important, supply chains need to be reassessed, et cetera, you're going to see our platform have much more advantage in the private equity business. So taking a step back, it's \u2013 we've demonstrated this over the years, which is with complexity comes opportunity and our platform and the culture of our teams working well together, we pivot, we adapt and we go to where the opportunities are.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to talk about the FRE margin a little bit, Curt, if \u2013 with the acquisitions, obviously, in incrementally very high fee margin businesses, just the timing of when you think you'll be surpassing like a percent level, whether that's in the second quarter or just more than the second half. And then as we think about growth in the retail business, Kew, maybe if you can just talk about how you think you might scale that, you scale your existing product architecture versus investing more on operational technology and sales and marketing and how that might impact the FRE margin?\nKewsong Lee: Hey, Brian, thanks for your question. So look, I'm really pleased and excited about where we are. So $850 million of FRE is what I told you guys a few weeks ago in terms of what I expect for us to do in fee-related earnings this year. That's really nice growth over the $600 million we did last year, not to mention where we were in the past. And margins, we just did 36% this quarter, and that's up 500 basis points from 31% a year ago. And with the deals that will turn on here in the second quarter, in particular in Global Credit, you're going to see that margin really expand. You're going to see it going up to 40% over the year in global credit. It's not going to take the whole firm to that level, but you're going to see continued growth in our margin over the balance of this year, and I'm very excited about that. And we're continuing to focus on that, but -- just as I've said before, first and foremost, is FRE growth. And then secondly, margin is a way to kind of get there, but we're really optimistic about the growth that we've had and where that's going. From a retail standpoint, I would be -- a lot of this is if you go back to what Kew said, it's about getting the right product in the market. We have some really nice products that we're putting in the market right now, CTAC is showing really good growth in the credit space. We have a number of things coming in. And a couple of things early on, even in the solution spectrum it's really going to take advantage. Same token, our team is really in the focus of ramping up in terms of our capacity to do that. And not to mention kind of just the historical 10% to 15% that we've always kind of done out of the retail space broadly defined. But look, it's -- we're going to pick our shots carefully as we go through retail and back specific products as opposed to trying to turn everything into our retail solution. The institutional market remains a good market for us, and it really -- in our platform, we're coming off of a year of very strong momentum, over $50 billion raised. First quarter was good. We're doing well.\nBrian Bedell: That\u2019s a great color. Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Chris Kotowski: Yes. I guess I'm wondering about -- you've had 3 kind of major initiatives on inorganic growth. And -- and knowing that you can't be very specific about other opportunities that you see. I guess I'm thinking, though, can you kind of frame the opportunities that are there? Are there opportunities in solutions, or what is the white space as you see it in terms of other inorganic growth opportunities?\nKewsong Lee: Chris -- go ahead, finish your question, your add-on question.\nQ \u2013 Chris Kotowski: Yes. Related to that, I mean -- or do you feel like that kind of your firm with these three initiatives, you're kind of tapped out for the moment when we should expect 12 to 24 months of integration and consolidation before you can move on to the next thing.\nKewsong Lee: Okay, Chris, it's Kew. Thanks for that question. Yes, look, obviously, we've been busy. We've announced 4 balance sheet transactions already this year. And in aggregate, they're going to move the needle for us. We're going to add approximately $120 million of high-margin FRE. It's going to continue to diversify our earnings stream and business mix and continue to help us accelerate perpetual capital in our -- supporting our earnings base, right? So -- and on that front, by the way, about 20% of our AUM is now perpetual capital. So as I said, we continue to look for opportunities to repurpose balance sheet capital. Our criteria, it has to be strategically adjacent, it has to be scalable and high growth, it has to be FR regenerative, and ideally, it has to be perpetual capital in nature. Of course, all these businesses needs to be compatible with our culture, which is a huge criteria for me and the team. We've been very busy -- there is no quota. There is no time line. In particular, I said this in the past, I think the credit business and the solutions business are the areas where there tends to be a lot of activity. But there is no, like I said, no quarter time line for needing to do anything. But I want to make sure you appreciate, we have a very intentional strategy to drive inorganic growth. We're very much out there looking for things to do that make strategic sense. So it's a proactive approach. But there's no way to predict when we're going to do the next one. And obviously, when there's something important to announce, you'll be the first to know.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. All right. Thank you. That's it for me.\nKewsong Lee: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO. Your line is open.\nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your Solutions business? And you mentioned rising demand for the solutions products generally. And the investment performance in solutions has been really strong. I'd be interested to hear some of your thoughts around the potential for growth there in new products, whether it's on the institutional side or perhaps something that might be introduced in the retail channel at some kind of a democratized product. Is that something you're seeing demand for? Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Thanks for the question, Rufus. Look, Solutions is an area that we're very excited about. First and foremost, the performance there has been really strong. So 4% appreciation this quarter, 35% in the last 12 months. The funds and performance have been great. Second, that's really translated. You can see that in the net accrued carry. It's now up about $340 million in that business. The distributable earnings potential out of solutions is very good. Keep in mind, those are European-style waterfall there, but then it's going to ramp up this year and then 2023, 2024, we should see some really good realizations out of this sector. It's -- the growth that we have in Solutions, it's still keep in mind that these are still funds. And so there's a natural stair-step aspect to it. But the deployment, in particular, in our secondaries business has been really strong. And so we see that kind of really kind of propelling our ability to grow that business quicker than otherwise would have occurred. And there's a lot of white space. So we're active in looking at kind of how to fill in and add new products, one of which is exactly what you're thinking around is how do we kind of tap that from a retail perspective. In the infancy stages, but you'll hear more about it over time and give us a little patience because we want to make sure it's all done right. But there's lots of great opportunities here for long-term growth. Hope that hits your questions, Rufus.\nRufus Hone: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein:  Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question as well. I wanted to start maybe with a question around the new breakout you guys are dealing within fee-related earnings breaking out, fee-related performance fee revenues, again, similar to, I guess, how many of your peers do it now. As we think about the trajectory and the baseline of kind of how to think about this revenue stream going forward, can you help us frame either the asset base, kind of the growth in the asset base, the consistency in these fees just to kind of help us better think through the impact on FRE going forward? And then just secondarily to that, just any comments around compensation rates or any other expenses we should keep in mind as we're building this out? Thank you. \nCurt Buser: It's a great question, and thank you. So look, the way I think about this, these are recurring revenue streams generally from perpetual like products, not subject to claw-back and not dependent upon divestment of the divestiture of the underlying investments. So, it's really a quarterly revenue piece. And you see it really interestingly, in our credit business, so we now give you the transparency. It was about a little over $9 million a year ago, about $14 million or so this quarter.  So you've seen real nice growth and that's really as in particular, like the CTAC business -- product that we referred to has grown. So as those perpetual nature products grow, you see it really kind of increase in size and that's -- while the numbers are relatively small, 48% growth. In our global private equity business, our core-plus real estate platform, same characteristics, it's now an $8 billion platform. And it's \u2013 since we've now kind of gotten to the point of scale and where we have visibility on that, that really kind of came in really strong this quarter. It's going to be more volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but really seeing the strength of that really on a year-to-year basis being real nice and continuing to grow as a business continues to perform well. And our US team has really done a nice job in all of their products in this one as well.  The thing to keep in mind on your question on the compensation, generally speaking, think about 45% of those revenues drive compensation, that's included in cash comp. So, if you think about it in the current quarter, some of the increased $15 million or so, $16 million or so of the increase in the quarter is really due to the increase in those performance revenues and so that's why your cash comp this quarter is a little bit higher than you otherwise expect. If you were to strip that out, we're at essentially about an 8% growth rate versus a quarter a year ago.  So Q1 '21 to Q1 '22 exclusive of this is about an 8% growth in comp. And the way I think about that is it's not too bad with the growth that we've had in FRE. Hopefully, that helps in terms of clarification on that.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks so much. I will jump back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to circle back to the private equity business. Just curious how your portfolio companies are navigating through sort of current backdrop with inflationary pressure, supply chain bottlenecks, rising interest rates. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how the portfolio companies are navigating, how Carlyle is helping those portfolio companies navigate through this environment? Maybe you can give a flavor for how much floating rate debt exposure there is at the portfolio of companies, how you're navigating around that? And what are you seeing in terms of revenue and EBITDA growth trends or there was accelerating, decelerating? Just any color there would be helpful? Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Hey Mike, thanks for the question. And Kew and I will team this one in terms of responding. So, look, the underlying portfolio in private equity has done really well. Obviously, in energy and in real estate and infrastructure that I think is kind of obvious to see kind of a lot of the drivers of that. Happy to kind of dive back into that.  In private equity traditional private equity, really what you're seeing is just amazing growth. So, we're seeing really strong growth in terms of both top line and underlying EBITDA. Now look, there's some exceptions, obviously, in the portfolio, but generally the performance has been really good. The other thing -- and look, we've got teams that focus on helping companies grow, improve, et cetera, and that's been working, continuing to invest in that from all areas, human capital, technology, data management, et cetera. The other thing that's really also been playing out is the number of transactions that we have teed up. So there's a number of signed transactions. If you were to put that in terms of carry, it's $500 million or so of net realized carry that we have signed up to -- that we think will come through in the next couple of quarters. So that, in connection with not only just good growth, in the companies and underlying stats, plus kind of what we've done to build a sign that stuff up. I think it's been really good. From a debt structure perspective, and Kew can weigh in here, generally, the strategy is always to get stuff converted to more of a fixed rate debt once we invest in the company. And so, I don't know the exact percentages, but it's a relatively high percentage that we try to get converted over to fixed. I don't know, Kew, if you have anything to add.\nKewsong Lee: Yes, Michael, the only thing -- a couple of points to highlight. First of all, as we look through to our private equity portfolio, obviously, it's very well constructed from a diversification basis. But -- the underlying operating metrics are quite strong. And look, obviously, every fund will have one or two issues here or there, but taken as a whole, our companies are managing inflation quite well and are finding ways to pass through higher input costs -- and currently, the operating margins are about as high as they've ever been. So I would point that out. Second, we tend to invest in companies that are in the higher growth parts of the economy. And so, it's much more of a -- there's a lot of growth. And when you marry that with the things that are happening with the use of digital to drive productivity, the changes in processes that have been made over the past two years, during a period of COVID, you're seeing productivity increases, which also enables these companies to perform better than they ever performed better before, which is kind of our mantra on how we drive value creation at all of our portfolio companies. So I think the first quarter performance of our portfolio highlights a lot of the strong operating performance of our -- of the underlying private equity portfolio. And as we told you, the marks were quite attractive and were up nicely, despite the market volatility that we witnessed. So we're pretty comfortable with how our portfolio companies are managing through this volatile environment thus far. And then, as it relates to floating rate versus fixed rate debt. Look, we have a lot of discipline about hedging out floating to fixed, as soon as we sign up deals or close deals. And we have a capital markets team that works with all of our portfolio companies to ensure that. We obviously don't swap everything out. And in certain instances, we do have a little bit of floating rate exposure, but we're always looking to manage financing cost risk, because we want the real driver of value creation at our portfolio companies to be growth. And we like to remove certain variables out of the equation, and that would be obviously interest rate volatility. So we do have real active hedging that we put in place to immunize ourselves from real big swings in rates.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks so much. Really appreciate all the color, including the carry pipeline. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next follow-up comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Realization activity in 1Q benefited from a few large deals that were announced before January. And I heard your response to the last question that there's a few more transactions out there. But in aggregate, how does the realization pipeline look heading into 2Q and 3Q, just lower exit valuations with the public markets and also less activity on the private side, too?\nCurt Buser: So Craig, the number I just quoted is our signed transactions should be Q2 or Q3, like I can't guarantee closings. But the team has done a real nice job of getting stuff lined up. And that's all private transactions. That's exclusive of exits of any of the public portfolio there'll be some of that as well. But the real thing that we're focused on is being able to exit where appropriate some of the larger transactions. That, coupled with what we're seeing both in credit opportunities where you see the carry turns on there as well as US real estate continue to perform strong, underpins a lot of strength in the year for carry. Look, it's always an imprecise science in terms of exact amounts per quarter. But still feel really good about the $1 billion for the half of the year. But obviously, that's dependent upon capital markets.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Curt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next follow-up comes from Rufus Hone with BMO. Your line is open.\nRufus Hone: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I was wondering how you think rising interest rates might have an impact on the potential for inorganic activity at Fortitude Re? And any commentary you can give around the competition for blocks would be helpful. Thank you.\nKewsong Lee: Yeah. hey, Rufus, it's Kew. Look, as rates go up, there's clearly recalibration of some valuations that are going on. And to the extent that, we do decide to make more moves strategically with respect to corporate development activity. Obviously, we will be factoring that in to how we think about value, valuation and pricing. So to the extent that, there is more volatility, to the extent that there's rising rates, to the extent that we see assets that, again, are strategically on target for us. We will be recalibrating valuations as the market environment changes. I'm not quite sure how to say anything more than we're going to be quite sensible about making sure our acquisitions reflect conditions and the future prospects and are strategically accretive and financially accretive for us. As it relates to blocks, I think you're referring to our Fortitude business. And I would just comment to say that, our pipeline of reinsurance and deal activity in Fortitude, which is the way we scale is about as high as I've ever seen it. There is a tremendous market for legacy liabilities that are a very attractive target set for Fortitude. It is a differentiated platform. It is a diversified liability streams that it can go after. It is not focus just on a monoline consumer-facing product. It's very differentiated in terms of its \u2013 the liabilities that it's targeting. And as such, I suspect that Fortitude is going to be busy for many years to come in light of the fact that we do believe we have a differentiated platform that's quite scalable and a very large addressable target market for us.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from the line of Alex Bolstein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Bolstein: Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. I wanted to ask a question around cash utilization and just capital management broadly. Since the Investor Day, you guys made it very clear that there's a lot of cash on the balance sheet, you will generate a lot more cash. And the goal is really to convert some of that cash into FRE, which should theoretically drive a higher multiple. That hasn't really happened yet. Stock has been under pressure. The implied multiples are quite low. What are your thoughts around deploying some of that capital back into the balance sheet and effectively buying back some stock in a more aggressive fashion here?\nCurt Buser: Hey, Alex, thanks for your question. Look, odd things happen in the market due to factors that we can control, and we're playing long ball here, and we're planning to grow a company that has strong characteristics of growth, FRE growth, earnings growth, delivering value for shareholders. And we think that, that's best done by investing in the business for -- you spelled out the strategy pretty well. And look, at the same token, we do buy back stock. So we spent $80 million this quarter buying back shares. You will see us also use stock as part of from growing the business than issuing stock in the acquisitions. So -- we had a little over 4 million shares issued in connection with the CBAM transaction. We'll continue to manage dilution for the shares that we issued to our people and manage that below the 1% dilution as we've historically done and try to drive that even lower than that on that side of the equation. Not making that same guarantee with respect to how we issue shares for acquisitions. So that will cause probably some more aggregate dilution because of acquisitions that we'll do. But as time goes and then based on capital flows and where things are, we'll pivot back and forth, again, focused on driving shareholder value.\nAlex Bolstein: Got it. All right. Makes sense. I figured out that. Thank you.\nCurt Buser: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Towanda, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I know it's another busy earnings day. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to Investor Relations at any time. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kewsong Lee",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're accelerating Carlyle's growth by diversifying our global business and running the firm better than ever before to drive long-term shareholder value. This strategy helped us continue to deliver for our shareholders and investors in the first quarter. Our FRE grew over 40% compared to the first quarter last year. Our leading investment platform demonstrated continued excellence as witnessed by record accrued carry balances, and we are increasingly diversified as over 2/3 of our total AUM is away from corporate private equity. We are pleased with our progress, and we will continue to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to drive further growth and diversification while maintaining investment excellence and business discipline as we navigate market and geopolitical uncertainty. The start of 2022 has been complex on many fronts, including the war in Ukraine and rising inflation and interest rates. And the world is now in a more tenuous place, specifically on our exposure to this conflict in region. Across our global portfolio and distribution platform, we have minimal direct exposure to Russia, Belarus or Ukraine and have not seen significant impact to Carlyle's business. Having said this, there are major paradigm shifts occurring, which are driving complexities and volatility in the investment environment, but Carlyle continues to perform. And importantly, our focus on thoughtful portfolio construction over the years is paying off this quarter. Our aggregate investment portfolio appreciated 5%, led by a 7% increase in global private equity, while public markets were down approximately 5%. We saw particular strength in our real estate platform with 10% appreciation and our infrastructure and natural resources platform with 19% appreciation. These were the major drivers of our net accrued performance revenue balance growing to $4.3 billion, a record level for our firm. Our credit strategies are also performing well. Our direct lending strategies are currently yielding approximately 9%, and the portfolios in our market-leading CLO business continue to have a default rate less than half the industry average. This broad-based performance across all asset classes is a testament to the value of our diversified global platform, time-tested investment approach and world-class teams. The private markets continue to outperform public markets over the long term, and our portfolios are well positioned for the current market environment. Turning to our growth and strategic plan to drive shareholder value. We're executing on what we told you and pleased with our progress. In the first quarter, we generated a record of $183 million of FRE, up 42% over the first quarter last year. This reflects the organic growth in our business over the past year and importantly, does not yet capture the impact from several strategic growth transactions we recently announced. To that end, we are also pursuing growth by repurposing balance sheet capital for strategic inorganic opportunities. On last quarter's call, we told you 2022 was going to be a breakout year for credit and insurance, 2 key areas identified for growth as part of our strategic plan, and we are already delivering on that. We're continuing to scale our global credit platform with FRE accretive acquisitions as evidenced by our recent iStar and CBAM transactions. And we also saw major milestones in insurance solutions with our $2 billion capital raise and creation of a new strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude. Our strategy in this area is differentiated, providing a real engine for growth and alignment for all stakeholders. This new agreement better aligns Carlyle's financial growth with the strategic interest of Fortitude and has significant and immediate impacts to our FRE in total AUM, which on a pro forma basis for this agreement is now approximately $375 billion. Keep in mind, with this new advisory relationship, we have a fee stream, which is more perpetual in nature and will grow as Fortitude continues to scale. Turning to fundraising, which continues to fuel our growth. In the first quarter, we raised more than $9 billion. Changing dynamics mostly related to a crowded private equity fundraising marketplace is affecting the timing of some of our private equity funds in the market, but the breadth of our platform and the strength of our brand and LP partnerships remains a differentiator for Carlyle. We continue to benefit from our diversification beyond traditional private equity as demonstrated by our second credit opportunities fund, which recently had a final close at $4.6 billion, almost twice as large as its predecessor fund as well as increasing traction within our infrastructure and renewable strategy. We have also added and launched a DISH products in Global Credit and Global Investment Solutions to meet the rising demands of investors for these asset strategies. Putting it all together, I want to underscore the real magnitude of the acceleration in FRE that we've delivered by executing against our strategy. In 2017, we delivered approximately $190 million in FRE. Last year, we reported almost $600 million. That is more than tripling our FRE in just 4 years. And now we said, we expect to deliver $850 million in FRE for 2022, which is 40% projected growth year-over-year. If we achieve that, we will have grown FRE by more than 4x in just 5 years. That is significant value creation for our shareholders. I'll end today with this. We are transforming Carlyle into a more diversified global investment firm, helping us capture growth in expanding strategic areas like global credit, infrastructure and renewables, insurance and global investment solutions, and we are doing this while building our powerful private equity business. We feel confident in our strategic plan and our ability to drive future FRE growth. Our leadership team is focused on managing through the complexities presented by the current market and geopolitical landscape, and I'd be remiss if I didn't continue to stress that this complexity and volatility also creates opportunity. We have built an increasingly diversified business mix that positions us well to continue capturing opportunities across the expanding private markets and to perform across cycles for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Curt. Ken, it's Kew. Thanks for that question. Look, we've been very focused on energy and energy transition in particular. And you're right to note that we do have a lot of capabilities across the broad spectrum of energy and alternative forms of energy investing. So -- let me just take a step back. Our firm view is we need to invest through this period of energy transition. Our platform is very well set up to do that. We can invest in traditional carbon businesses, obviously, with a real ESG lens on it, yet we have a spectrum of products, including a very strong renewables platform. And we have all this -- supported by world-class ESG teams and an infrastructure business as we look around the world, trying to think about what's happening to the energy sector, the focus on energy security and really the need to keep investing in energy transition. So we are very well set up to invest in all the opportunities that are going to come up and down the spectrum, and we're excited about the prospects moving forward. Sure, Gerry. Look, retail is one of several alternative channels for us in terms of capital formation, which clearly, we are paying a lot of attention to. It will be important to do that as we supplement our institutional fundraising platform. And to reiterate, just so you know, we're already raising approximately 10% to 15% of our capital from the retail channel broadly defined. Now what's important for us and how we're thinking about this is we need to access this developing channel with the appropriate product architecture. And I've said this before, it's mostly -- this channel fits really well with products out of credit, real estate and the solutions segments of our business. So for instance, we've developed a strategy, Curt mentioned it, for the retail customer called CTAC, Carlyle Tactical Private Credit Fund within Global Credit, which, without much fanfare at all, is already raising on a run rate basis, about $1 billion a year from retail, and that's before we've accessed the wirehouses, which we expect to start later this year. And of course, we've got other products we are developing to raise capital from this growing channel. Now I want to temper this with the obvious that we have to make sure our operational technology and all the regulatory issues are being considered very carefully. But no doubt, there's real long-term opportunity here given the strength of our brand. And similar to what we've done with our credit strategy, we're going to be very thoughtful and patient as we develop the right product architecture and our organizational capabilities to access capital formation successfully in this clearly attractive channel. Good morning. Yes. The upshot is, I think it's more a timing issue than anything else. The demand obviously, for private market products are very strong. But let me just provide a little bit more color and some context for you. So look, over the last 12 months, we've raised $53 billion, a little more than $9 billion just this quarter. So, we do have strong momentum across our platform, and we are seeing real demand and real strength in areas like private credit, real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, and solutions. With respect to private equity, there are some changing dynamics mostly driven by the record number of funds that are coming back to market much faster than LPs thought in large part, because of the success that the private equity asset class has had over the past few years. So, this is going to result in longer time frames to traditional private equity fundraising. But taking a big step back, I think this is where the diversification that we've undergone and the breadth of our platform is so important because we have a broad array of fundraising going on across the firm any given point in time. And we really feel good if you take a step back about the products we have and the progress we're making in the market. Importantly, you just saw it, the performance we're generating consistently across cycles. And as demonstrated this quarter, it's that type of performance. The historical strength of our partnership with LPs, the strength of our brand. It's a huge differentiator for us in these types of markets. Craig, let me just add one other comment, which I think is really important, which is to take a step back and think about Carlyle and capital formation in totality. So, everyone is focused on fundraising, but keep in mind, we just acquired $65 billion of AUM between CBAM, about $15 billion and Fortitude about $50 billion. That's outside of traditional fundraising, that's $65 billion, that's seven times the amount that we fundraised this quarter. So, the point being that fundraising is just one aspect of our capital formation strategies. We're continually looking for new inflows of capital to drive our future growth. Thanks Craig. Yes, the big picture is the type of issues you're raising, the complexities, actually, I think, favor platforms like ours. It's a broad platform, as you know, globally, lots of industry sector expertise. And we're across all asset strategies. So we're continually pivoting and adapting to go to where the opportunities are. In a world of \u2013 let's just start with volatility, there's higher volatility. That, for sure, is creating deal flow for us in our credit business, particularly in credit opportunities, and in our solutions business, LPs need to rebalance and re-jigger their portfolios in light of what's happening in the markets, and we are seeing increased activity levels in our solutions business. As you see rates rise, there's increasing demand for private credit strategies that are floating rate based, which the majority of our strategies are in our private credit business. So we're seeing real demand for direct lending for CLO business, and that's all quite positive. As it relates to private equity, I referred to this in other commentary, but \u2013 but there was a slight pause in M&A activity, which was everybody thought, buyers and sellers were taking a step back to recalibrate in light of the obvious environmental issues. But we are seeing that activity come back pipelines are about as full as ever. And I really like the architecture of our private equity business because in a world, Mike, that's decoupling, our strong Asia platform, Europe platform, Americas platform, Japan platform, really plays to our advantage because we have deep local teams that have already been set up within the regions. So as regionalization occurs and regional ecosystems become more important, supply chains need to be reassessed, et cetera, you're going to see our platform have much more advantage in the private equity business. So taking a step back, it's \u2013 we've demonstrated this over the years, which is with complexity comes opportunity and our platform and the culture of our teams working well together, we pivot, we adapt and we go to where the opportunities are. Hey, Brian, thanks for your question. So look, I'm really pleased and excited about where we are. So $850 million of FRE is what I told you guys a few weeks ago in terms of what I expect for us to do in fee-related earnings this year. That's really nice growth over the $600 million we did last year, not to mention where we were in the past. And margins, we just did 36% this quarter, and that's up 500 basis points from 31% a year ago. And with the deals that will turn on here in the second quarter, in particular in Global Credit, you're going to see that margin really expand. You're going to see it going up to 40% over the year in global credit. It's not going to take the whole firm to that level, but you're going to see continued growth in our margin over the balance of this year, and I'm very excited about that. And we're continuing to focus on that, but -- just as I've said before, first and foremost, is FRE growth. And then secondly, margin is a way to kind of get there, but we're really optimistic about the growth that we've had and where that's going. From a retail standpoint, I would be -- a lot of this is if you go back to what Kew said, it's about getting the right product in the market. We have some really nice products that we're putting in the market right now, CTAC is showing really good growth in the credit space. We have a number of things coming in. And a couple of things early on, even in the solution spectrum it's really going to take advantage. Same token, our team is really in the focus of ramping up in terms of our capacity to do that. And not to mention kind of just the historical 10% to 15% that we've always kind of done out of the retail space broadly defined. But look, it's -- we're going to pick our shots carefully as we go through retail and back specific products as opposed to trying to turn everything into our retail solution. The institutional market remains a good market for us, and it really -- in our platform, we're coming off of a year of very strong momentum, over $50 billion raised. First quarter was good. We're doing well. Thanks. Chris -- go ahead, finish your question, your add-on question.\nQ \u2013 Chris Kotowski: Yes. Related to that, I mean -- or do you feel like that kind of your firm with these three initiatives, you're kind of tapped out for the moment when we should expect 12 to 24 months of integration and consolidation before you can move on to the next thing. Okay, Chris, it's Kew. Thanks for that question. Yes, look, obviously, we've been busy. We've announced 4 balance sheet transactions already this year. And in aggregate, they're going to move the needle for us. We're going to add approximately $120 million of high-margin FRE. It's going to continue to diversify our earnings stream and business mix and continue to help us accelerate perpetual capital in our -- supporting our earnings base, right? So -- and on that front, by the way, about 20% of our AUM is now perpetual capital. So as I said, we continue to look for opportunities to repurpose balance sheet capital. Our criteria, it has to be strategically adjacent, it has to be scalable and high growth, it has to be FR regenerative, and ideally, it has to be perpetual capital in nature. Of course, all these businesses needs to be compatible with our culture, which is a huge criteria for me and the team. We've been very busy -- there is no quota. There is no time line. In particular, I said this in the past, I think the credit business and the solutions business are the areas where there tends to be a lot of activity. But there is no, like I said, no quarter time line for needing to do anything. But I want to make sure you appreciate, we have a very intentional strategy to drive inorganic growth. We're very much out there looking for things to do that make strategic sense. So it's a proactive approach. But there's no way to predict when we're going to do the next one. And obviously, when there's something important to announce, you'll be the first to know. Thanks, Chris. Yes, Michael, the only thing -- a couple of points to highlight. First of all, as we look through to our private equity portfolio, obviously, it's very well constructed from a diversification basis. But -- the underlying operating metrics are quite strong. And look, obviously, every fund will have one or two issues here or there, but taken as a whole, our companies are managing inflation quite well and are finding ways to pass through higher input costs -- and currently, the operating margins are about as high as they've ever been. So I would point that out. Second, we tend to invest in companies that are in the higher growth parts of the economy. And so, it's much more of a -- there's a lot of growth. And when you marry that with the things that are happening with the use of digital to drive productivity, the changes in processes that have been made over the past two years, during a period of COVID, you're seeing productivity increases, which also enables these companies to perform better than they ever performed better before, which is kind of our mantra on how we drive value creation at all of our portfolio companies. So I think the first quarter performance of our portfolio highlights a lot of the strong operating performance of our -- of the underlying private equity portfolio. And as we told you, the marks were quite attractive and were up nicely, despite the market volatility that we witnessed. So we're pretty comfortable with how our portfolio companies are managing through this volatile environment thus far. And then, as it relates to floating rate versus fixed rate debt. Look, we have a lot of discipline about hedging out floating to fixed, as soon as we sign up deals or close deals. And we have a capital markets team that works with all of our portfolio companies to ensure that. We obviously don't swap everything out. And in certain instances, we do have a little bit of floating rate exposure, but we're always looking to manage financing cost risk, because we want the real driver of value creation at our portfolio companies to be growth. And we like to remove certain variables out of the equation, and that would be obviously interest rate volatility. So we do have real active hedging that we put in place to immunize ourselves from real big swings in rates. Yeah. hey, Rufus, it's Kew. Look, as rates go up, there's clearly recalibration of some valuations that are going on. And to the extent that, we do decide to make more moves strategically with respect to corporate development activity. Obviously, we will be factoring that in to how we think about value, valuation and pricing. So to the extent that, there is more volatility, to the extent that there's rising rates, to the extent that we see assets that, again, are strategically on target for us. We will be recalibrating valuations as the market environment changes. I'm not quite sure how to say anything more than we're going to be quite sensible about making sure our acquisitions reflect conditions and the future prospects and are strategically accretive and financially accretive for us. As it relates to blocks, I think you're referring to our Fortitude business. And I would just comment to say that, our pipeline of reinsurance and deal activity in Fortitude, which is the way we scale is about as high as I've ever seen it. There is a tremendous market for legacy liabilities that are a very attractive target set for Fortitude. It is a differentiated platform. It is a diversified liability streams that it can go after. It is not focus just on a monoline consumer-facing product. It's very differentiated in terms of its \u2013 the liabilities that it's targeting. And as such, I suspect that Fortitude is going to be busy for many years to come in light of the fact that we do believe we have a differentiated platform that's quite scalable and a very large addressable target market for us."

            "name": "Curt Buser",
            "content": "Thank you, Kew, and good morning, everyone. I want to focus on three areas in my remarks that complement Kew's comments, but also a follow up on our presentation from just a few weeks ago. First, our strong start to the year in fee-related earnings underscores the work we have done to broaden our earnings stream and provide increased balance to our distributable earnings; second, our thoughtful and differentiated portfolio construction underpins our ability to deliver strong distributable earnings; and third, we're poised for additional FRE growth, further diversifying our earnings streams. Let's begin by discussing our strong start to the year in fee-related earnings. We generated a record level of fee-related earnings, 42% higher than a year ago, and our FRE margins increased to 36%, up 500 basis points from a year ago. And all of this is before any meaningful contribution from our recently completed acquisitions that will be additive beginning next quarter. Management fees of $454 million increased 19% year-over-year with the most significant growth in global private equity and global credit, driven by solid fundraising activity and active deployment. Compared to the fourth quarter, global private equity management fees declined due to strong realization activity in the second half of 2021, alongside a step-down in Carlyle Partners VII management fees. In Global Credit, you will see a material step-up in quarterly FRE from our most recent acquisitions beginning next quarter with CBAM, which closed on March 21 and Fortitude, which closed on April 1, both adding high incremental margin FRE. In Global Private equity, FRE should continue to build throughout the year as we raise additional capital in our new buyout and growth vehicles, and we expect to see higher levels of top line fees throughout the year. This quarter, we began reporting a new line item in our non-GAAP results, which was historically reported as a component of fund management fees, fee-related performance revenue. This presentation is similar to disclosures from others in our industry. Included in this line item are regularly recurring performance revenues we earn from our perpetual products, such as our credit interval fund, CTAC, our BDCs and core-plus real estate. The latter of which accelerated meaningfully this quarter as we pass through the third anniversary of the CPI Fund. We expect to generate significant revenues in this line item every year, though certain quarters throughout the year will be higher than others. Moving on. Our portfolio performed incredibly well in the first quarter, as Kew summarized, with 5% overall appreciation. Our portfolio construction, diversity of investments and strong underlying performance of our portfolio companies more than offset the negative impact of increasing market uncertainty and the downward pressure from our public positions, which currently make up only about 10% of our portfolio. The only area where we have meaningful direct exposure to Belarus, Ukraine and Russia across our investment platform is in our credit aviation portfolio, which resulted in downward valuations in these funds for the quarter. As Kew noted, the portfolio's appreciation drove our accrued carry balance to a record $4.3 billion. To put that in perspective, our accrual is up about 35% year-over-year and has more than tripled over the past 2 years. This level of net accrued performance revenue provides us further confidence that Carlyle expects to generate our previously indicated average of $1 million of annual net realized performance revenues over the next several years dependent upon market conditions. First quarter's net realized performance revenues of $118 million was up 55% from last year's first quarter though below recent record levels and was driven by exits in our Japan buyout funds, U.S. real estate funds and our credit opportunities fund. Now as we look forward, we're off to a strong start to the year with distributable earnings this quarter up more than 40% higher than a year ago, and we have already signed several large transactions that are expected to close in the next few quarters. Adding to this growth will be the 3 transactions we discussed in March that add $120 million in annualized run rate FRE and $65 billion in both AUM and fee earning AUM. That is more than 16% in annualized FRE on a run rate basis that ends up for 40% FRE growth in 2022. That's attractive growth, highlighting both acceleration in our organic investment platform and optionality driven from strategically utilizing our balance sheet to drive inorganic growth. We are purposefully shaping our business to grow FRE, expand margins, diversify earnings and now increasingly access larger sources of perpetual capital. In sum, we're on track to grow in the short term while continuing to also invest in our longer-term growth. Our portfolio is performing well in a challenging environment, and we are moving forward with active fundraising deployment and exits across our global investment platform. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Hey Craig. Thanks for the question, Rufus. Look, Solutions is an area that we're very excited about. First and foremost, the performance there has been really strong. So 4% appreciation this quarter, 35% in the last 12 months. The funds and performance have been great. Second, that's really translated. You can see that in the net accrued carry. It's now up about $340 million in that business. The distributable earnings potential out of solutions is very good. Keep in mind, those are European-style waterfall there, but then it's going to ramp up this year and then 2023, 2024, we should see some really good realizations out of this sector. It's -- the growth that we have in Solutions, it's still keep in mind that these are still funds. And so there's a natural stair-step aspect to it. But the deployment, in particular, in our secondaries business has been really strong. And so we see that kind of really kind of propelling our ability to grow that business quicker than otherwise would have occurred. And there's a lot of white space. So we're active in looking at kind of how to fill in and add new products, one of which is exactly what you're thinking around is how do we kind of tap that from a retail perspective. In the infancy stages, but you'll hear more about it over time and give us a little patience because we want to make sure it's all done right. But there's lots of great opportunities here for long-term growth. Hope that hits your questions, Rufus. It's a great question, and thank you. So look, the way I think about this, these are recurring revenue streams generally from perpetual like products, not subject to claw-back and not dependent upon divestment of the divestiture of the underlying investments. So, it's really a quarterly revenue piece. And you see it really interestingly, in our credit business, so we now give you the transparency. It was about a little over $9 million a year ago, about $14 million or so this quarter.  So you've seen real nice growth and that's really as in particular, like the CTAC business -- product that we referred to has grown. So as those perpetual nature products grow, you see it really kind of increase in size and that's -- while the numbers are relatively small, 48% growth. In our global private equity business, our core-plus real estate platform, same characteristics, it's now an $8 billion platform. And it's \u2013 since we've now kind of gotten to the point of scale and where we have visibility on that, that really kind of came in really strong this quarter. It's going to be more volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but really seeing the strength of that really on a year-to-year basis being real nice and continuing to grow as a business continues to perform well. And our US team has really done a nice job in all of their products in this one as well.  The thing to keep in mind on your question on the compensation, generally speaking, think about 45% of those revenues drive compensation, that's included in cash comp. So, if you think about it in the current quarter, some of the increased $15 million or so, $16 million or so of the increase in the quarter is really due to the increase in those performance revenues and so that's why your cash comp this quarter is a little bit higher than you otherwise expect. If you were to strip that out, we're at essentially about an 8% growth rate versus a quarter a year ago.  So Q1 '21 to Q1 '22 exclusive of this is about an 8% growth in comp. And the way I think about that is it's not too bad with the growth that we've had in FRE. Hopefully, that helps in terms of clarification on that. Hey Mike, thanks for the question. And Kew and I will team this one in terms of responding. So, look, the underlying portfolio in private equity has done really well. Obviously, in energy and in real estate and infrastructure that I think is kind of obvious to see kind of a lot of the drivers of that. Happy to kind of dive back into that.  In private equity traditional private equity, really what you're seeing is just amazing growth. So, we're seeing really strong growth in terms of both top line and underlying EBITDA. Now look, there's some exceptions, obviously, in the portfolio, but generally the performance has been really good. The other thing -- and look, we've got teams that focus on helping companies grow, improve, et cetera, and that's been working, continuing to invest in that from all areas, human capital, technology, data management, et cetera. The other thing that's really also been playing out is the number of transactions that we have teed up. So there's a number of signed transactions. If you were to put that in terms of carry, it's $500 million or so of net realized carry that we have signed up to -- that we think will come through in the next couple of quarters. So that, in connection with not only just good growth, in the companies and underlying stats, plus kind of what we've done to build a sign that stuff up. I think it's been really good. From a debt structure perspective, and Kew can weigh in here, generally, the strategy is always to get stuff converted to more of a fixed rate debt once we invest in the company. And so, I don't know the exact percentages, but it's a relatively high percentage that we try to get converted over to fixed. I don't know, Kew, if you have anything to add. So Craig, the number I just quoted is our signed transactions should be Q2 or Q3, like I can't guarantee closings. But the team has done a real nice job of getting stuff lined up. And that's all private transactions. That's exclusive of exits of any of the public portfolio there'll be some of that as well. But the real thing that we're focused on is being able to exit where appropriate some of the larger transactions. That, coupled with what we're seeing both in credit opportunities where you see the carry turns on there as well as US real estate continue to perform strong, underpins a lot of strength in the year for carry. Look, it's always an imprecise science in terms of exact amounts per quarter. But still feel really good about the $1 billion for the half of the year. But obviously, that's dependent upon capital markets. Hey, Alex, thanks for your question. Look, odd things happen in the market due to factors that we can control, and we're playing long ball here, and we're planning to grow a company that has strong characteristics of growth, FRE growth, earnings growth, delivering value for shareholders. And we think that, that's best done by investing in the business for -- you spelled out the strategy pretty well. And look, at the same token, we do buy back stock. So we spent $80 million this quarter buying back shares. You will see us also use stock as part of from growing the business than issuing stock in the acquisitions. So -- we had a little over 4 million shares issued in connection with the CBAM transaction. We'll continue to manage dilution for the shares that we issued to our people and manage that below the 1% dilution as we've historically done and try to drive that even lower than that on that side of the equation. Not making that same guarantee with respect to how we issue shares for acquisitions. So that will cause probably some more aggregate dilution because of acquisitions that we'll do. But as time goes and then based on capital flows and where things are, we'll pivot back and forth, again, focused on driving shareholder value. Thanks."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I would like to hand the call over to Daniel Harris, Head of Public Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDaniel Harris : Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Carlye\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me on the call this morning, is our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz and our Chief Financial Officer, John Redett.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release in a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast and replay will be available.  We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We provide a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP and our earnings release to the extent reasonably available.  Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including those identified in the risk factor section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlye assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time.  In order to ensure participation by all those on the line today, please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue for any additional follow ups. In our earnings presentation this quarter, you'll find several additional pages in the front of the release, starting with Page 6 that Harvey and John will refer to during our remarks. As I mentioned, you could find the presentation on our IR website to follow along.  With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz.\nHarvey Schwartz : Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our firm finished 2023 with significant momentum. We set several records last year which you see on Page 6. They include: record FRE at $859 million; record Q4 FRE margin of 43%, and we finished the year with record AUM at $426 billion.  We also raised $17 billion of capital in the fourth quarter, our third largest fundraising quarter in the history of the firm. We want to thank our investing clients for the trust they put in us as their fiduciary and the entire Carlyle team for their hard work. Again, we finished the year with significant momentum, which sets us up for success in 2024.  Now, please turn to Page 7 in the document. In today's discussion, John and I are going to focus on four key areas. First, enhancing stakeholder alignment and changes we plan to make to our compensation model. Second, optimizing capital and our approach to returning capital to shareholders. Third, strategic initiatives in 2024. And lastly, we will delineate explicit financial targets for 2024.  Now turning to Page 8, enhancing stakeholder alignment. Today, we're announcing a shift in our compensation strategy explicitly designed to enhance alignment across all of our stakeholders, our investing clients, our employees, and you our shareholders. Carlyle has a performance-driven culture and our senior investing professionals want their compensation more tightly tied to performance. Shareholders also get more of what they value most a significant step up in steady, recurring fee related earnings, and FRE margin. And our investing clients also benefit from our teams having more skin in the game. It is a win-win-win for each of our stakeholders, our investing clients, our senior employees and our shareholders.  Second, I'd like to discuss changes to our capital allocation strategy. Please turn to Slide 9. We've increased our share repurchase capacity by an incremental $1 billion for a total of $1.4 billion. Given our strong balance sheet and positive outlook, this incremental capacity provides us flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders. At the share price, our board and senior leadership see tremendous value in the enterprise, the opportunity to return capital to shareholders is clearly quite compelling. John will walk through our thinking about capital management and our approach in more detail.  Now moving to Page 10, I want to touch on several strategic initiatives. Global Credit insurance is positioned for strong growth. Global Credit is now our largest segment with almost $190 billion of AUM. We have driven a nearly 300% increase in credit AUM over the past four years. In Insurance, we added $29 billion of AUM in 2023 from Fortitude, including the Lincoln financial transaction. We have strong momentum coming into 2024 and a deep pipeline of growth opportunities.  In Investment Solutions, we also have great operating momentum. We've grown AUM 70% over the past four years to $77 billion. Our secondaries and co-investment strategies are producing attractive returns for their investors and are well positioned to capture opportunities in the current environment. Global Investment Solutions should see FRE shift sharply higher in 2024 as the effect of strong fundraising impacts our results.  We've also made progress growing our wealth strategy. The Carlyle brand is a unique and powerful asset. Since inception, we raised nearly $50 billion of wealth assets. We are incredibly appreciative of the trust that our wealth management partners have placed in us on behalf of their clients. We look forward to continue to work with them as we grow this business together.  We're excited to have our credit interval fund CTAC and RP secondary fund CAPM in the market today. And we will have a PE product in the market in the next several quarters.  Now switching to expense management. While we focus on growth, we're also keeping a careful eye on expenses. In 2023, we grew headcount as we continue to invest across our platform. At the same time, we delivered expense savings in other areas. Again, while growth remains our key area of focus, executing our strategy in a disciplined manner will allow us to expand margins at the same time.  Before I got to John, turning to Page 11, let me give you a quick preview on our 2024 financial targets. We are targeting FRE of $1.1 billion. We are targeting FRE margins to increase to a range of 40% to 50%. We are targeting inflows to exceed $40 billion in 2024. And again, we have significantly increased our ability to return capital to shareholders by expanding the share buyback capacity. Again, we intend to be active buyers of our stock as we see strong value returning capital to you, our shareholders. We began 2024 with clear momentum.  And with that, let me now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Redett : Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. I want to cover several topics this morning and echo a few comments already made. First, stakeholder alignment and changes to our compensation strategy. Second, capital allocation. Third, I want to provide some comments on our 2023 results. And lastly, our 2024 financial targets. Updates to our compensation strategy were driven by our desire to create an even better stakeholder alignment and drive fee-related earnings to our shareholders. Essentially, compensation for our senior people will become more success based. As a result, our earnings mix will increasingly shift to a more shareholder friendly fee-related earnings model as our compensation changes phase in over the next few years.  This should show up in two main ways. And if you want to follow along, flip to Page 8. Our FRE related cash compensation ratio will decline to 30% to 35% from 45% to 50%. Our realized performance revenue compensation ratio will increase to 60% to 70% from 45% to 50%. I want to be clear, this is not about changing the overall level of compensation, but rather having a higher portion of compensation being success driven. This change should be neutral to DE overtime. In connection with these changes, we incurred a onetime non-cash GAAP charge of $1.1 billion, largely related to the value of future carry going to employees. This will allow us to generate higher FRE for shareholders more quickly. Even after this charge, our net accrued carry balance ended the year at $2.4 billion and continued to represent over $6 per share in future earnings for our shareholders. In addition, we awarded performance stock units to a select number of senior professionals that have the accountability to help us achieve our growth objectives. These units are highly aligned with shareholders as they only invest with significant share price appreciation.  As Harvey mentioned, we now have the capacity to buy back $1.4 billion in stock. This is in addition to an expected annual dividend to shareholders of over $500 million. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to both return meaningful capital to shareholders and importantly, invest for growth. These are not mutually exclusive decisions. Investing into our businesses remains our top priority.  Moving on, let me highlight just a few over year-end results. We generated $1.4 billion in DE or $3.24 per share, our third best year on record. We produced $531 million in net realized performance revenues despite a difficult market backdrop.  Turning to fee-related earnings. We produced a record $254 million of FRE in the fourth quarter with an FRE margin of 43%, also a record. And for the year, we produced a record $859 million in FRE. As we already noted, we expect a meaningful shift higher in 2024 for both FRE and margin. Finally, as Harvey mentioned, we had a strong finish to the year in terms of fundraising, bringing in $37 billion in 2023, more than 20% higher than the prior year. Included in that total is more than $9 billion in new capital raised by Global Credit in the fourth quarter alone.  We have significant momentum going into 2024. We expect FRE to be approximately $1.1 billion, more than 25% higher than 2023. We expect our FRE margin to increase to 40% to 50% and lastly, we expect inflows to be more than $40 billion.  In closing, we produced record results in 2023, and we finished the year with strong momentum. Now let me turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein : Hi, good morning, Harvey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. \nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah, hi. \nAlexander Blostein : So first, I appreciate -- hello. So appreciate all the strategic changes you guys are making today. That's great. And obviously, the more explicit disclosure is also very helpful. I was hoping we could start with the discussion on the momentum you highlighted in your prepared remarks. As you look out into 2024, particularly with respect to fundraising, I know you highlighted over $40 billion. So I was hoping you could walk us through that.  And then sort of related to that, as you think about the momentum in the business, how does that inform the pacing of the share repurchase announcement you guys made today as well? Thanks.\nJohn Redett : Okay. Alex, thanks. So you really could feel it Bill, as a new CEO coming in 2023 and new to the company. As you know, and we talked about this. I really felt like my priority was to spend time with my teams and time of my all keys and my investing clients. And I spent -- I mean I think I met with over 300 investing clients during the course of the year. And obviously, you spent a lot of time internally. And that was really about my teams getting to know me, which is more important even than me going to know them.  And you could really feel -- and I think I even talked about it in the third quarter, we could feel the momentum building in terms of the focus, the execution, the receptivity of the brand. And it all came together with these record results, record FRE, record margin, the cost-saving initiatives and you're seeing the fundraising. In terms of coming to '24, the momentum feels good, and to [indiscernible] backdrop complicate it. And I feel cautiously optimistic about the environment in 2024, which should provide a tailwind and maybe some upside in these targets.  Specifically around fundraising, I'll make two comments. One, I know you all focus on a quarter-to-quarter. We really think about fundraising in terms of how can we provide the best value to our LPs. But putting it in together, we put it together the way you think. We built up knowing what we'll be focused on in the course of the year. And so we feel good about these numbers.\nHarvey Schwartz : And Alex, in terms of the buyback part of your question, look, we've been spending a lot of time thinking about capital allocation. And we're going to take a much more disciplined approach in terms of how we execute on capital allocation.  I think the $1.4 billion buyback is an important first step, and we don't think the stock reflects the true value of the franchise. So you should consider us to be active buyers of our stock. I think it's also important to remember, we have a very strong balance sheet, which enables us to have the flexibility to -- in addition to giving capital back to our shareholders via a $1.4 billion stock buyback and our dividend, we have the flexibility and balance sheet strength to continue to invest in our business for growth.\nAlexander Blostein : Great. Thank you very much. \nHarvey Schwartz : Thanks, Alex. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. As we look at credit, fundraising was elevated at $9 billion. It looks like 50% more than you raised in the first three quarters of the year combined, and you gave some color in the deck on CLOs and CTAC, but it feels like there's more to these numbers. So can you flesh out the jump in fundraising this quarter in credit and sort of how that should continue into this year?\nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I would say, look, I think it's really tough to look at fundraising kind of quarter-to-quarter. There's obviously going to be a lot of volatility. We had a great, great fundraising fourth quarter. We actually had a great year for fundraising and credit as well. And I expect importantly that, that momentum in credit fundraising will continue well into 2024. We've got good visibility on that. It was really, really spread across all of our products that we're raising money for CLOs, as you mentioned, CTAC, which is our retail credit products always in the market. CCOP [ph] we raised money for it as well and Carlyle Strategic Solutions, which is our kind of asset-backed fund. So it's pretty consistent across the platform.  I think the important takeaway is not focusing quarter-to-quarter. We had a good year but we have really good momentum going into 2024 for credit fundraising and quite frankly, fundraising more broadly.\nKen Worthington : Great. Thank you. \nHarvey Schwartz : Thanks, Ken. \nJohn Redett : Thanks, Ken. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt : Hi, good morning, everyone. \nHarvey Schwartz : Hi, Patrick.\nPatrick Davitt : You mentioned the compensation framework will phase in. So what are you assuming for 2024 in your $1.1 billion guide? And in that vein, what are you assuming for transactions and FRPR? And if realizations do remain subdued, do you have a commitment from employees to these compensation ratio? In other words, will you have to -- will you have to abandon these targets if the realizations don't get better? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz : So, it's one of the reasons when we were going through our remarks in the prepared pages, we put out a range. Look, this is super important. We're going to execute on this compensation change very deliberately. The range really gives us the flexibility to execute on this deliberately.  Look, we have no idea what the market backdrop will look like. But look, I think you should walk away from this thinking our intent is for this to be DE neutral. The vast majority of our employees will not be impacted. There will be some variability in compensation for our senior folks in year-to-year. But if you look at it over a couple of year period, our intent is for compensation to not be up or not be down, and that's how we'll manage it.  I think it's also important to point out, and I mentioned that in my remarks, the senior people that will have some variability in their compensation, we did grant them performance stock units. So we really have great alignment with our senior people. These performance stock units are really shareholder friendly. They only vest upon share price appreciation. And quite frankly, I think everyone here, and on the call hopes they actually do best because they're very shareholder friendly instrument.  In terms of the 2024, $1.1 billion FRE target, you look at the 25% step-up from our 859 FRE in 2023, we feel very good about it. It really is three components. It\u2019s growth, which we\u2019re very focused on. Two, it\u2019s the compensation change and third, we will continue to manage the business prudently in terms of expenses. We have no intention of cutting to the bone, but we will manage the business prudently, but it is a growth, prudent expense management and compensation changes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nChris Kotowski : Yeah. Can you hear me? \nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah, hey, Chris. Good morning. \nChris Kotowski : Hey. Good morning. I was wondering under your $40 billion fundraising target, if you could drill down into the composition of that a bit more and in particular, kind of -- even if you can't give us the numbers and -- but kind of like the -- what should we expect during the course of the year relating to the -- to the two big flagship funds in Europe and Asia that you're raising?\nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah. So I think you should think about it broadly across the platform. We have a lot of momentum, as you saw coming off the record fundraising the activity in the fourth quarter. But you should expect to see really good fundraising activity in credit across the private equity platform, our real estate business, our private equity business across infrastructure, the whole space. So we built this model up across the entire franchise. I think in private equity, like the rest of the industry, specifically, I'm talking about the narrow definition of private equity, corporate private equity. I think there'll still be headwinds in the industry for that. But across our platform, we feel good about the $40 billion number. I will emphasize with John again, we report these numbers quarterly. We just don't think about fundraising. We don't run the business for a quarter but we feel good about the momentum in the business, really good about it.\nJohn Redett : And the only thing I'd add is in the solutions business, we have a couple of funds in the market. And we're showing -- we're seeing great momentum in solutions as well in addition to private equity and credit.\nChris Kotowski : Okay. Great. And then just kind of curious, the $1.4 billion share buyback authorization, is that conceived of as a one-year authorization? Or is that more flexible? Because when you add the $1.4 billion and you add the dividend, it's actually -- it ends up speaking for quite a lot of your likely DE at the end of the year?\nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah. So again, the way John framed this, and let's just take a step back. I think many of you have known me for years in terms of how I think around the discipline of capital. But just taking a step back, when we think about capital, we think about growth and shareholder alignment and returning capital to shareholders and investing in growth. And we think about this really purely through the events of really where is the marginal ROI. So the first thing that's most important about this is the investing in growth and we have capital available for that. This allocation to share repurchase reflects the fact that when we look at the enterprise value of our firm, it's quite compelling to return capital to shareholders. So we haven't narrowed this to one year for sure, but what we want to do is give ourselves the full range of flexibility. We're going to be very disciplined, very systematic about this in terms of driving growth, returning capital to shareholders and finding the balance, effectively the efficient frontier of where that exists. And that's how we're thinking about it.  But it's not a one year because as you implied, in addition to the dividend, which is $500 million this year, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. But again, as John said earlier, you should expect to see us be active buying stock back.\nChris Kotowski : Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nHarvey Schwartz : Hi, Brian. \nBrian Mckenna : Hey, Harvey, I know you're deemphasizing performance income a bit just with the comp changes this morning. But I'm curious, how are you thinking about the rebuild of net accrued performance revenues over time? After a 20% apples-to-apples year-over-year decline in 2023 on the heels of solid realizations? And specifically, kind of that rebuild as it relates to the contribution from some of the more recent flagship private equity strategies?\nJohn Redett : Yeah, Brian, it's John. I wouldn't say we're deemphasizing performance revenue or carrier realization. It's still -- it's still a very core component of our business, and we expect it to be a core component of our business going forward.  You're right, less of that is going to shareholders and more is going to employees and shareholders are getting more high-margin fee earnings as far as this comp reset. As I said in my remarks, we still have net accrued carry of roughly $2.4 billion which still represents $6 a share. I still think it's a very meaningful percentage of our share price.\nBrian Mckenna : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell : Hi, great. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the comp change and FRE. Maybe just to talk about the FRE margin the range not comp range, but the actual margin target range of 40% to 50%. I guess, sort of what is at both ends of that, what would be the key variabilities. Because it's a little bit wide for this year. And then in line with that, as we sort of march through '24 and getting to '25 and '26 longer term, is the intent to show or to build on the FRE margin each year and have a sort of a longer term more steady growth profile to that?  And if you can comment on the contribution from Capital Markets business. I know Harvey, you've been working on building that up. And it looks like you reported very good your transaction fee results just this fourth quarter as well.\nHarvey Schwartz : So let me take a step back a little bit and just tell you how we're thinking about it as a leadership team. First of all, thanks for noting the capital markets momentum, pretty muted environment actually for capital markets. The team really came together and embraced the focus. And we think that will carry through into 2024 for sure.  In terms of the compensation model change and the range, one of the reasons why John is only out of that range is, first and foremost, for us, it's about talent. It's about attracting and retaining the best talent. We have an extraordinary team here. And we want to make sure that as we introduce this, we actually have the flexibility to make sure that we do this methodically patiently and overtime.  So you'll see us move within this range and you'll see periods of outperformance and periods where basically this access a shop, it's over, but this is an output. We're going to manage the talent and make sure our talent gets paid for their performance first and foremost. That's the most critical thing, because that will deliver for everyone in the long run that will deliver for investing clients and that it'll deliver for our shareholders. But that's how we designed the model. \nBrian Bedell: Thank you. \nDaniel Harris : Take the next question, operator. I don't think we can hear you. Who's up? Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBen Budish : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Harvey, in the deck, you identified Investment Solutions as one of your strategic initiatives. And I'm just curious, typically, we see sort of your two major funds kind of go and raise flagships around the same time. And so we see like very large pickup in AUM, followed by maybe a period of flatter AUM growth.  You indicated that we should see a sharp upswing in 2024 in terms of FRE. But just curious, given that you identified that as a strategic initiative, how might that cadence change in 2025 and 2026? Does this mean potentially more vehicles or more sort of run-of-the-mill fundraising? What should we expect to see there? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz : So in '24, look, I showed up a year ago, literally almost everyday. And I was the lucky recipient of some amazing franchise businesses and some great talent. One of those things is our secondary business. And over the course of the year, their growth. And as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we're expecting a doubling of FRE. It's an incredibly talented team with a huge amount of momentum. There's aspects of that business that we continue to build is a financing component in that business. Obviously, I mentioned the fact that we've just launched recently CAPM. I think this is a tremendous opportunity for wealth clients, it's a diversified portfolio with really consistent performance. So I think you'll just -- you'll see us grow this business in a prudent way.  I think historically, maybe it didn't get highlighted as much. But this is a really strong team with a lot of momentum.\nBen Budish : Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. \nHarvey Schwartz : Hey, Brennan. How are you?\nBrennan Hawken : I\u2019m good, Harvey. I hope you\u2019re doing well. So understanding you guys have touched on this a little bit, but I'm hoping maybe we could peel a little because you've made a couple of references to the comp change John indicated it was phased in over time. And Harvey, I believe you indicated that it was a function somewhat as a shock absorber.  So I'm sure there's nuance and layers to it, but maybe could you help us distill a little bit, what is the phase-in going to look overtime. And even once it's fully phased is the entire range still in play allowing for the shock absorbers. Could you just help us understand the difference in between how those two will play out in the next coming years?\nHarvey Schwartz : So what I would say, again, we're talking about incentive alignment across all our constituencies, pay for performance and really managing this process over a very long period of time. It's not for a quarter or a year. And so again, when I said stock absorber, the way I think about the compensation ratio is it will be dynamic reflecting the performance. And we want to make sure that we are investing in our talent, rewarding our talent consistently.  But there will be years where there'll be lower realizations and you may see the compensation ratio tick up a little bit. We're giving ourselves that flex. The most important thing about the financial targets we put out because I know that's new is our confidence around the margin, the $1.1 billion FRE target and the fundraising. And of course, obviously, the announcement around our share repurchase capacity. So we feel highly confident around those numbers, but we're giving you some insight into how we think about things as a leadership team.\nBrennan Hawken : Got it. Thank you. John, though, you referenced a phase-in period. Could you help us understand what that would look like?\nJohn Redett : Yeah. I think Harvey covered that. I mean, look, it's -- we're going to phase it in over a couple of years. We're going to be very deliberate in terms of how we do this. This is -- this is compensation. We're a human capital business. It's a very important component of our business. So you should think of it over a couple of years. And quite frankly, I don't know what the markets look like. So we're going to kind of react to how the markets are. Again, I think the important thing to walk away from is not only do we create better stockholder alignment. Our intent is not to pay people more or less. Our intent is really to have a performance-based, success-based compensation structure in place. And that's what we've achieved with this structure.\nBrennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. \nJohn Redett : Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions, this morning. \nHarvey Schwartz : Hi, Bill. \nBill Katz : So I was wondering if you could just unpack -- good morning. And thank you again for the question. Just wondering if we could unpack the $40 billion just a little bit further. And I know you went through at a very broad level, but could you sort of underline just in terms of where you think you are in terms of Europe and Asia in terms of success of fund opportunity. And then perhaps you said this in your prepared comments, I missed it in the supplement. How many incremental shares are you issuing to management? And what are some of the sort of the key return assumption to test that stock? Thank you.\nJohn Redett: Yeah. In terms -- let me take the fundraising first. As Harvey said, in terms of investment solutions, we have great momentum in secondaries in co-investment. In terms of private equity, we have great demand for our Japan buyout fund. We'll soon be in the market with our real estate product, which has fantastic returns. In terms of our Asia buyout and European buyout, look, I think they will continue to face in 2024, industry headwinds that we're seeing in our peers are seeing as well. But we do have a couple of private equity products in the market that I think will be very well received with good demand. And I covered some of the multiple credit products in the market, which we're very, very optimistic about. In terms of the PSUs. Again, these were targeted to the senior-most level professionals in Carlyle. These professionals are really the individuals that are accountable for growth. And these are the individuals that are driving growth. I think these are very shareholder-friendly instruments. I think our shareholders will want these to vest. Think of it as roughly $300 million of value in the share price appreciation targets are 20%, 40% and 60%. Again, these are very shareholder-friendly instruments. If our share price doesn't hit those targets, these shares do not vest.\nBill Katz : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDaniel Fannon : Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on non-comp expense. John, I think last quarter, you mentioned $40 million in run rate savings so far with more to come. Can you talk about kind of 2024 and what those numbers might look like and/or other initiatives you have in place to also complement that FRE margin expansion in addition to the comp stuff you announced today?\nJohn Redett: Thanks, Daniel. Look, I think if you look at our fourth quarter margin of 43%, which is a record for us, I think it really shows the progress we've made. To be honest, I think we've made progress faster than I anticipated. We're just going to continue to focus on expenses. We're not done. We're just going to manage the firm prudently in terms of expenses. I still think there's some opportunity going into 2024. But look, more importantly, this isn't going to be an expense story. We're much more focused on growth. We're investing in the businesses. But I would say there's probably some additional opportunity on expenses that we'll get out in 2024, but that's not going to be the story. It's going to be more about growth.\nDaniel Fannon : Thank you.\nJohn Redett : Thanks, Dan. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak : Hi, good morning. \nHarvey Schwartz : Hey, Steven.\nSteven Chubak : Hey, John. I wanted to ask on the CLO business. The originations in the liquid credit business picked up nicely in 4Q, admittedly remains fairly subdued, but the outlook in the space appears to be improving. How has the deployment landscape evolve just given the improving capital markets backdrop that you cited? And how should we think about the pickup in that business as we look out to '24?\nJohn Redett : So it's again an incredible franchise business for Carlyle, market leader. In the quarter, we raised our first captive equity fund, CLO partners. I think it's accurate to say against what many people would have thought was a tough market backdrop. It really speaks to the strength of the franchise, the quality of the team, a 20-year franchise with long history of performance. The fund -- the raise was oversubscribed as they were literally in and out of the market in a few months. I think it's the fastest CLO captive equity fundraise maybe in the history of time.  And so really, really proud of the work that they've done and the momentum they have. Now again, the market backdrop has been improving. You're starting to see banks picking up investing in triple As again. This is all a reflection of credit spreads coming in tighter. So we feel good about the business momentum here. And the team is extraordinary.\nSteven Chubak : Great. Thanks for taking my question. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is open.\nMike Brown : Okay. Great. Hey, good morning. The large share buyback authorization certainly makes sense here given the valuation disconnect versus the peer group. Just wanted to ask about the potential for strategic M&A and if that could start to enter the equation a little more when you think about capital allocation? I know it hasn't been a top priority for you, Harvey, in your first year, but it seems like that could eventually become an effective lever for Carlyle to consider down the road.\nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah. So I would say, certainly open to it, let me give you my framing. Again, many of you know me, but many of you know my family, sort of first principles approach. We see marginal opportunity that's very clear to us in growing and building on the base of the franchise, right? We have all the, footings. We have a world-leading corporate private equity business world-leading real estate franchise, world-leading secondaries business, a world leading credit growing business. I just talked about this a little business. So all the footings of what we need to, as a global private markets manager, they're all in place.  And the brand, so we have a lot we can build off of, and you start to see, again, that momentum in the record results from last year and in the numbers we've given you for this year. I think, again, first principles, we would never take anything off the table. I think if the industrial logic makes sense, it's good for our investing clients. Our teams and our shareholders, we'd be open to it. And we'll certainly consider things, but we're not feeling any pressure at this stage, not with this kind of momentum.\nMike Brown : Okay, thank you. Great color. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on credit insurance. If you could just elaborate a bit on the deep pipeline of growth opportunities that you alluded to for credit and insurance. Maybe you could just update us on some of the steps that you're taking to accelerate growth there and best capture the opportunity set that you see in credit and insurance, what new products can make sense? And in any areas that could make sense to fill in with hiring?\nHarvey Schwartz : So again, you saw really strong performance out of the credit insurance platform. John referenced the $9 billion inflows in the fourth quarter. I think that we really like our positioning here. So the capital-light model gives us a huge amount of flexibility and allows us to be able to pivot in a number of different directions. And so I feel very good about the future here. I think the pipeline potential activity really reflects the partnership we have with Fortitude and really what will be happening for the foreseeable future in the insurance sector and the opportunity to build on the Fortitude platform is quite clear.  So we have a number of different steps we can take to keep growing. So the outlook over the next couple of years feels quite good.\nMichael Cyprys : Thanks.  Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr : Hello there. \nHarvey Schwartz : Hey, Glenn. How are you?\nGlenn Schorr : All righty. Sorry, one more. I'm curious to put a finer point on the buyback versus investing conversation. So Part A is just will this result in a net reduction of shares? Or is this offsetting stock-based comp? But the bigger point I want to make is I hear you on all the growth areas and I see the momentum. There are also a bunch of areas that you're not yet scaled in across private markets and there's so much growth. So I'm just curious on how you balance this return of capital versus this plethora of opportunity across private markets that you could be putting money to work in? Thanks. \nHarvey Schwartz : Yeah. So again, that's why I understand and Glenn, you've known this about me for a long time. That's why I underscore, and I think I step back and say, listen, we want to think about the approach to capital management. This gives us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders because we think the enterprise value is so compelling here.  At the same time, we're not sacrificing growth. And so when we look forward over the next couple of years, we wanted this flexibility, and we will move back and forth, but we are 100% making sure we invest in growth. And we think the growth opportunities for Carlyle are pretty extraordinary, and we have the momentum. And I think you see it in the financial targets. So I would agree with you.\nGlenn Schorr : Net buyback, shares go down?\nHarvey Schwartz : I think -- I don't know what John said it earlier, what is it about 10% of the market. I think the math should be pretty easy on that. So I think if we end up utilizing all of this, over the next several quarters, I think the math is pretty easy.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Daniel Harris for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today, for your time and for your questions. Should you have any follow-ups, please give Investor Relations a call. Otherwise, we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nHarvey Schwartz : Thanks, everyone.\nJohn Redett : Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our firm finished 2023 with significant momentum. We set several records last year which you see on Page 6. They include: record FRE at $859 million; record Q4 FRE margin of 43%, and we finished the year with record AUM at $426 billion.  We also raised $17 billion of capital in the fourth quarter, our third largest fundraising quarter in the history of the firm. We want to thank our investing clients for the trust they put in us as their fiduciary and the entire Carlyle team for their hard work. Again, we finished the year with significant momentum, which sets us up for success in 2024.  Now, please turn to Page 7 in the document. In today's discussion, John and I are going to focus on four key areas. First, enhancing stakeholder alignment and changes we plan to make to our compensation model. Second, optimizing capital and our approach to returning capital to shareholders. Third, strategic initiatives in 2024. And lastly, we will delineate explicit financial targets for 2024.  Now turning to Page 8, enhancing stakeholder alignment. Today, we're announcing a shift in our compensation strategy explicitly designed to enhance alignment across all of our stakeholders, our investing clients, our employees, and you our shareholders. Carlyle has a performance-driven culture and our senior investing professionals want their compensation more tightly tied to performance. Shareholders also get more of what they value most a significant step up in steady, recurring fee related earnings, and FRE margin. And our investing clients also benefit from our teams having more skin in the game. It is a win-win-win for each of our stakeholders, our investing clients, our senior employees and our shareholders.  Second, I'd like to discuss changes to our capital allocation strategy. Please turn to Slide 9. We've increased our share repurchase capacity by an incremental $1 billion for a total of $1.4 billion. Given our strong balance sheet and positive outlook, this incremental capacity provides us flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders. At the share price, our board and senior leadership see tremendous value in the enterprise, the opportunity to return capital to shareholders is clearly quite compelling. John will walk through our thinking about capital management and our approach in more detail.  Now moving to Page 10, I want to touch on several strategic initiatives. Global Credit insurance is positioned for strong growth. Global Credit is now our largest segment with almost $190 billion of AUM. We have driven a nearly 300% increase in credit AUM over the past four years. In Insurance, we added $29 billion of AUM in 2023 from Fortitude, including the Lincoln financial transaction. We have strong momentum coming into 2024 and a deep pipeline of growth opportunities.  In Investment Solutions, we also have great operating momentum. We've grown AUM 70% over the past four years to $77 billion. Our secondaries and co-investment strategies are producing attractive returns for their investors and are well positioned to capture opportunities in the current environment. Global Investment Solutions should see FRE shift sharply higher in 2024 as the effect of strong fundraising impacts our results.  We've also made progress growing our wealth strategy. The Carlyle brand is a unique and powerful asset. Since inception, we raised nearly $50 billion of wealth assets. We are incredibly appreciative of the trust that our wealth management partners have placed in us on behalf of their clients. We look forward to continue to work with them as we grow this business together.  We're excited to have our credit interval fund CTAC and RP secondary fund CAPM in the market today. And we will have a PE product in the market in the next several quarters.  Now switching to expense management. While we focus on growth, we're also keeping a careful eye on expenses. In 2023, we grew headcount as we continue to invest across our platform. At the same time, we delivered expense savings in other areas. Again, while growth remains our key area of focus, executing our strategy in a disciplined manner will allow us to expand margins at the same time.  Before I got to John, turning to Page 11, let me give you a quick preview on our 2024 financial targets. We are targeting FRE of $1.1 billion. We are targeting FRE margins to increase to a range of 40% to 50%. We are targeting inflows to exceed $40 billion in 2024. And again, we have significantly increased our ability to return capital to shareholders by expanding the share buyback capacity. Again, we intend to be active buyers of our stock as we see strong value returning capital to you, our shareholders. We began 2024 with clear momentum.  And with that, let me now turn the call over to John. Yeah, hi. And Alex, in terms of the buyback part of your question, look, we've been spending a lot of time thinking about capital allocation. And we're going to take a much more disciplined approach in terms of how we execute on capital allocation.  I think the $1.4 billion buyback is an important first step, and we don't think the stock reflects the true value of the franchise. So you should consider us to be active buyers of our stock. I think it's also important to remember, we have a very strong balance sheet, which enables us to have the flexibility to -- in addition to giving capital back to our shareholders via a $1.4 billion stock buyback and our dividend, we have the flexibility and balance sheet strength to continue to invest in our business for growth. Thanks, Alex. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I would say, look, I think it's really tough to look at fundraising kind of quarter-to-quarter. There's obviously going to be a lot of volatility. We had a great, great fundraising fourth quarter. We actually had a great year for fundraising and credit as well. And I expect importantly that, that momentum in credit fundraising will continue well into 2024. We've got good visibility on that. It was really, really spread across all of our products that we're raising money for CLOs, as you mentioned, CTAC, which is our retail credit products always in the market. CCOP [ph] we raised money for it as well and Carlyle Strategic Solutions, which is our kind of asset-backed fund. So it's pretty consistent across the platform.  I think the important takeaway is not focusing quarter-to-quarter. We had a good year but we have really good momentum going into 2024 for credit fundraising and quite frankly, fundraising more broadly. Thanks, Ken. Hi, Patrick. So, it's one of the reasons when we were going through our remarks in the prepared pages, we put out a range. Look, this is super important. We're going to execute on this compensation change very deliberately. The range really gives us the flexibility to execute on this deliberately.  Look, we have no idea what the market backdrop will look like. But look, I think you should walk away from this thinking our intent is for this to be DE neutral. The vast majority of our employees will not be impacted. There will be some variability in compensation for our senior folks in year-to-year. But if you look at it over a couple of year period, our intent is for compensation to not be up or not be down, and that's how we'll manage it.  I think it's also important to point out, and I mentioned that in my remarks, the senior people that will have some variability in their compensation, we did grant them performance stock units. So we really have great alignment with our senior people. These performance stock units are really shareholder friendly. They only vest upon share price appreciation. And quite frankly, I think everyone here, and on the call hopes they actually do best because they're very shareholder friendly instrument.  In terms of the 2024, $1.1 billion FRE target, you look at the 25% step-up from our 859 FRE in 2023, we feel very good about it. It really is three components. It's growth, which we're very focused on. Two, it's the compensation change and third, we will continue to manage the business prudently in terms of expenses. We have no intention of cutting to the bone, but we will manage the business prudently, but it is a growth, prudent expense management and compensation changes. Yeah, hey, Chris. Good morning. Yeah. So I think you should think about it broadly across the platform. We have a lot of momentum, as you saw coming off the record fundraising the activity in the fourth quarter. But you should expect to see really good fundraising activity in credit across the private equity platform, our real estate business, our private equity business across infrastructure, the whole space. So we built this model up across the entire franchise. I think in private equity, like the rest of the industry, specifically, I'm talking about the narrow definition of private equity, corporate private equity. I think there'll still be headwinds in the industry for that. But across our platform, we feel good about the $40 billion number. I will emphasize with John again, we report these numbers quarterly. We just don't think about fundraising. We don't run the business for a quarter but we feel good about the momentum in the business, really good about it. Yeah. So again, the way John framed this, and let's just take a step back. I think many of you have known me for years in terms of how I think around the discipline of capital. But just taking a step back, when we think about capital, we think about growth and shareholder alignment and returning capital to shareholders and investing in growth. And we think about this really purely through the events of really where is the marginal ROI. So the first thing that's most important about this is the investing in growth and we have capital available for that. This allocation to share repurchase reflects the fact that when we look at the enterprise value of our firm, it's quite compelling to return capital to shareholders. So we haven't narrowed this to one year for sure, but what we want to do is give ourselves the full range of flexibility. We're going to be very disciplined, very systematic about this in terms of driving growth, returning capital to shareholders and finding the balance, effectively the efficient frontier of where that exists. And that's how we're thinking about it.  But it's not a one year because as you implied, in addition to the dividend, which is $500 million this year, that's how we're thinking about it. But again, as John said earlier, you should expect to see us be active buying stock back. Hi, Brian. So let me take a step back a little bit and just tell you how we're thinking about it as a leadership team. First of all, thanks for noting the capital markets momentum, pretty muted environment actually for capital markets. The team really came together and embraced the focus. And we think that will carry through into 2024 for sure.  In terms of the compensation model change and the range, one of the reasons why John is only out of that range is, first and foremost, for us, it's about talent. It's about attracting and retaining the best talent. We have an extraordinary team here. And we want to make sure that as we introduce this, we actually have the flexibility to make sure that we do this methodically patiently and overtime.  So you'll see us move within this range and you'll see periods of outperformance and periods where basically this access a shop, it's over, but this is an output. We're going to manage the talent and make sure our talent gets paid for their performance first and foremost. That's the most critical thing, because that will deliver for everyone in the long run that will deliver for investing clients and that it'll deliver for our shareholders. But that's how we designed the model. So in '24, look, I showed up a year ago, literally almost everyday. And I was the lucky recipient of some amazing franchise businesses and some great talent. One of those things is our secondary business. And over the course of the year, their growth. And as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we're expecting a doubling of FRE. It's an incredibly talented team with a huge amount of momentum. There's aspects of that business that we continue to build is a financing component in that business. Obviously, I mentioned the fact that we've just launched recently CAPM. I think this is a tremendous opportunity for wealth clients, it's a diversified portfolio with really consistent performance. So I think you'll just -- you'll see us grow this business in a prudent way.  I think historically, maybe it didn't get highlighted as much. But this is a really strong team with a lot of momentum. Hey, Brennan. How are you? So what I would say, again, we're talking about incentive alignment across all our constituencies, pay for performance and really managing this process over a very long period of time. It's not for a quarter or a year. And so again, when I said stock absorber, the way I think about the compensation ratio is it will be dynamic reflecting the performance. And we want to make sure that we are investing in our talent, rewarding our talent consistently.  But there will be years where there'll be lower realizations and you may see the compensation ratio tick up a little bit. We're giving ourselves that flex. The most important thing about the financial targets we put out because I know that's new is our confidence around the margin, the $1.1 billion FRE target and the fundraising. And of course, obviously, the announcement around our share repurchase capacity. So we feel highly confident around those numbers, but we're giving you some insight into how we think about things as a leadership team. Hi, Bill. Hey, Steven. Yeah. So I would say, certainly open to it, let me give you my framing. Again, many of you know me, but many of you know my family, sort of first principles approach. We see marginal opportunity that's very clear to us in growing and building on the base of the franchise, right? We have all the, footings. We have a world-leading corporate private equity business world-leading real estate franchise, world-leading secondaries business, a world leading credit growing business. I just talked about this a little business. So all the footings of what we need to, as a global private markets manager, they're all in place.  And the brand, so we have a lot we can build off of, and you start to see, again, that momentum in the record results from last year and in the numbers we've given you for this year. I think, again, first principles, we would never take anything off the table. I think if the industrial logic makes sense, it's good for our investing clients. Our teams and our shareholders, we'd be open to it. And we'll certainly consider things, but we're not feeling any pressure at this stage, not with this kind of momentum. So again, you saw really strong performance out of the credit insurance platform. John referenced the $9 billion inflows in the fourth quarter. I think that we really like our positioning here. So the capital-light model gives us a huge amount of flexibility and allows us to be able to pivot in a number of different directions. And so I feel very good about the future here. I think the pipeline potential activity really reflects the partnership we have with Fortitude and really what will be happening for the foreseeable future in the insurance sector and the opportunity to build on the Fortitude platform is quite clear.  So we have a number of different steps we can take to keep growing. So the outlook over the next couple of years feels quite good. Hey, Glenn. How are you? Yeah. So again, that's why I understand and Glenn, you've known this about me for a long time. That's why I underscore, and I think I step back and say, listen, we want to think about the approach to capital management. This gives us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders because we think the enterprise value is so compelling here.  At the same time, we're not sacrificing growth. And so when we look forward over the next couple of years, we wanted this flexibility, and we will move back and forth, but we are 100% making sure we invest in growth. And we think the growth opportunities for Carlyle are pretty extraordinary, and we have the momentum. And I think you see it in the financial targets. So I would agree with you. I think -- I don't know what John said it earlier, what is it about 10% of the market. I think the math should be pretty easy on that. So I think if we end up utilizing all of this, over the next several quarters, I think the math is pretty easy. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "John Redett",
            "content": "Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. I want to cover several topics this morning and echo a few comments already made. First, stakeholder alignment and changes to our compensation strategy. Second, capital allocation. Third, I want to provide some comments on our 2023 results. And lastly, our 2024 financial targets. Updates to our compensation strategy were driven by our desire to create an even better stakeholder alignment and drive fee-related earnings to our shareholders. Essentially, compensation for our senior people will become more success based. As a result, our earnings mix will increasingly shift to a more shareholder friendly fee-related earnings model as our compensation changes phase in over the next few years.  This should show up in two main ways. And if you want to follow along, flip to Page 8. Our FRE related cash compensation ratio will decline to 30% to 35% from 45% to 50%. Our realized performance revenue compensation ratio will increase to 60% to 70% from 45% to 50%. I want to be clear, this is not about changing the overall level of compensation, but rather having a higher portion of compensation being success driven. This change should be neutral to DE overtime. In connection with these changes, we incurred a onetime non-cash GAAP charge of $1.1 billion, largely related to the value of future carry going to employees. This will allow us to generate higher FRE for shareholders more quickly. Even after this charge, our net accrued carry balance ended the year at $2.4 billion and continued to represent over $6 per share in future earnings for our shareholders. In addition, we awarded performance stock units to a select number of senior professionals that have the accountability to help us achieve our growth objectives. These units are highly aligned with shareholders as they only invest with significant share price appreciation.  As Harvey mentioned, we now have the capacity to buy back $1.4 billion in stock. This is in addition to an expected annual dividend to shareholders of over $500 million. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to both return meaningful capital to shareholders and importantly, invest for growth. These are not mutually exclusive decisions. Investing into our businesses remains our top priority.  Moving on, let me highlight just a few over year-end results. We generated $1.4 billion in DE or $3.24 per share, our third best year on record. We produced $531 million in net realized performance revenues despite a difficult market backdrop.  Turning to fee-related earnings. We produced a record $254 million of FRE in the fourth quarter with an FRE margin of 43%, also a record. And for the year, we produced a record $859 million in FRE. As we already noted, we expect a meaningful shift higher in 2024 for both FRE and margin. Finally, as Harvey mentioned, we had a strong finish to the year in terms of fundraising, bringing in $37 billion in 2023, more than 20% higher than the prior year. Included in that total is more than $9 billion in new capital raised by Global Credit in the fourth quarter alone.  We have significant momentum going into 2024. We expect FRE to be approximately $1.1 billion, more than 25% higher than 2023. We expect our FRE margin to increase to 40% to 50% and lastly, we expect inflows to be more than $40 billion.  In closing, we produced record results in 2023, and we finished the year with strong momentum. Now let me turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions. Okay. Alex, thanks. So you really could feel it Bill, as a new CEO coming in 2023 and new to the company. As you know, and we talked about this. I really felt like my priority was to spend time with my teams and time of my all keys and my investing clients. And I spent -- I mean I think I met with over 300 investing clients during the course of the year. And obviously, you spent a lot of time internally. And that was really about my teams getting to know me, which is more important even than me going to know them.  And you could really feel -- and I think I even talked about it in the third quarter, we could feel the momentum building in terms of the focus, the execution, the receptivity of the brand. And it all came together with these record results, record FRE, record margin, the cost-saving initiatives and you're seeing the fundraising. In terms of coming to '24, the momentum feels good, and to [indiscernible] backdrop complicate it. And I feel cautiously optimistic about the environment in 2024, which should provide a tailwind and maybe some upside in these targets.  Specifically around fundraising, I'll make two comments. One, I know you all focus on a quarter-to-quarter. We really think about fundraising in terms of how can we provide the best value to our LPs. But putting it in together, we put it together the way you think. We built up knowing what we'll be focused on in the course of the year. And so we feel good about these numbers. Thanks, Ken. And the only thing I'd add is in the solutions business, we have a couple of funds in the market. And we're showing -- we're seeing great momentum in solutions as well in addition to private equity and credit. Yeah, Brian, it's John. I wouldn't say we're deemphasizing performance revenue or carrier realization. It's still -- it's still a very core component of our business, and we expect it to be a core component of our business going forward.  You're right, less of that is going to shareholders and more is going to employees and shareholders are getting more high-margin fee earnings as far as this comp reset. As I said in my remarks, we still have net accrued carry of roughly $2.4 billion which still represents $6 a share. I still think it's a very meaningful percentage of our share price. Yeah. I think Harvey covered that. I mean, look, it's -- we're going to phase it in over a couple of years. We're going to be very deliberate in terms of how we do this. This is -- this is compensation. We're a human capital business. It's a very important component of our business. So you should think of it over a couple of years. And quite frankly, I don't know what the markets look like. So we're going to kind of react to how the markets are. Again, I think the important thing to walk away from is not only do we create better stockholder alignment. Our intent is not to pay people more or less. Our intent is really to have a performance-based, success-based compensation structure in place. And that's what we've achieved with this structure. Thanks. Yeah. In terms -- let me take the fundraising first. As Harvey said, in terms of investment solutions, we have great momentum in secondaries in co-investment. In terms of private equity, we have great demand for our Japan buyout fund. We'll soon be in the market with our real estate product, which has fantastic returns. In terms of our Asia buyout and European buyout, look, I think they will continue to face in 2024, industry headwinds that we're seeing in our peers are seeing as well. But we do have a couple of private equity products in the market that I think will be very well received with good demand. And I covered some of the multiple credit products in the market, which we're very, very optimistic about. In terms of the PSUs. Again, these were targeted to the senior-most level professionals in Carlyle. These professionals are really the individuals that are accountable for growth. And these are the individuals that are driving growth. I think these are very shareholder-friendly instruments. I think our shareholders will want these to vest. Think of it as roughly $300 million of value in the share price appreciation targets are 20%, 40% and 60%. Again, these are very shareholder-friendly instruments. If our share price doesn't hit those targets, these shares do not vest. Thanks, Daniel. Look, I think if you look at our fourth quarter margin of 43%, which is a record for us, I think it really shows the progress we've made. To be honest, I think we've made progress faster than I anticipated. We're just going to continue to focus on expenses. We're not done. We're just going to manage the firm prudently in terms of expenses. I still think there's some opportunity going into 2024. But look, more importantly, this isn't going to be an expense story. We're much more focused on growth. We're investing in the businesses. But I would say there's probably some additional opportunity on expenses that we'll get out in 2024, but that's not going to be the story. It's going to be more about growth. Thanks, Dan. So it's again an incredible franchise business for Carlyle, market leader. In the quarter, we raised our first captive equity fund, CLO partners. I think it's accurate to say against what many people would have thought was a tough market backdrop. It really speaks to the strength of the franchise, the quality of the team, a 20-year franchise with long history of performance. The fund -- the raise was oversubscribed as they were literally in and out of the market in a few months. I think it's the fastest CLO captive equity fundraise maybe in the history of time.  And so really, really proud of the work that they've done and the momentum they have. Now again, the market backdrop has been improving. You're starting to see banks picking up investing in triple As again. This is all a reflection of credit spreads coming in tighter. So we feel good about the business momentum here. And the team is extraordinary. Thanks."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz; and Chief Financial Officer, John Redett. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release to the extent reasonably available. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. So turning to our results. For the third quarter, we generated $205 million in fee-related earnings and $367 million in distributable earnings with DE per common share of $0.87. Our net accrued carry balance was $3.5 billion as of the end of the quarter, and we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share. In order to ensure participation by all those on the call today, please limit yourself to one question and return to the queue for any additional follow-ups. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll update you on the areas where we have strong momentum and where we're focused on accelerating growth. Before getting into that, let me touch on the macro. An already complex environment has become increasingly uncertain with the tragic events unfolding in the Middle East. Multiple wars, along with higher rates and economic uncertainty has increased volatility and reduced confidence levels. As we all know, sentiment is the greatest market elixir, and negative sentiment has slowed transaction activity over the past year. That said, despite the challenging market backdrop, deal activity has shown signs of improvement as third quarter buyout activity was at the highest pace in over a year. However, my own opinion is that lower activity levels and reduced confidence will likely persist for a bit longer. As we said in the past, our view is that rates will stay higher for longer. After 20 years of declining rates and central bank market intervention, the overall cost of capital has shifted higher and may remain so for some time. Market participants have reluctantly accepted this reality and begun repricing assets based on this outcome. However, as is often the case in market regime shifts, this process of market digestion will take time. Ultimately, higher rates could dampen economic activity. Complex and uncertain environments don't necessarily mean a lack of opportunity as we've seen over decades navigating through all market cycles. Our goal investment teams continue to stay focused on generating excess alpha in this market environment. And with over $70 billion of dry powder across our platform, we have the flexibility to deploy capital and build on strategic partnerships. Now let me shift to areas of focus as we position the firm for growth. First, our insurance strategy has very strong underlying momentum. Fortitude's announced transaction with Lincoln Financial has met all closing conditions and is expected to close later this month. We will pick up approximately $24 billion in new AUM from the increase in Fortitude's general account assets as well as additional capital that rotates into Carlyle funds. In addition to this transaction, our team is developing new investment and distribution strategies that target the needs of insurance investors and our private credit business. We see substantial growth and potential new transactions across the insurance vertical. Next, private wealth. The Carlyle brand has always been received well in the private wealth channel, and we're building on that momentum. We have raised over $45 billion from this channel over time. And this year, we have raised more than $3 billion. I feel good about this channel given the strength of our brand. Over the coming quarters and years, we expect to accelerate product development and see further growth in sales and distribution. There's a lot of upside in private wealth, and we expect our footprint to be significantly larger in coming years. Moving on, we're seeing momentum across several of our investment strategies in the market today. A few examples include Japan buyout, U.S. real estate and secondaries. Each of these strategies are on track to grow meaningfully due to strong investment performance, our deep client relationships and an attractive set of deployment opportunities. During the quarter, we raised $6.3 billion in new capital, bringing year-to-date fundraising to $20 billion. Overall, we've not been pleased with our pace of fundraising thus far in 2023, but our current expectation is for a step higher in new capital raise throughout the fourth quarter. With the final close of our latest U.S. buyout strategy, we now have $105 billion of corporate private equity assets under management, including $21 billion in dry powder across our CP funds that allow us to pursue deals of any size around the globe. We continue to raise capital for next vintage Asia, Europe and Japan buyout strategies, which should further add to this amount in the coming quarters. Moving to credit. This is an area we're focused on accelerating our growth and expect to be significantly larger over time. Global Credit has built a diverse set of strategies to serve an increasing number of institutional and private wealth LPs to manage over $150 billion in assets today, nearly triple the level of just three years ago, including the world's largest CLO business. Our team is focused on the significant opportunity ahead to attract assets that migrate from bank balance sheets to private capital strategies, a trend we expect to play out over the next several years. Finally, let me focus on expense management. We have made faster progress in this area than I originally expected. I give a lot of credit to the team for driving this process. We've identified several areas that have already led to a lower run rate of expenses. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected third quarter FRE. I expect an even larger impact in 2024. The changes we're making across the firm are improving our organizational structure, emphasizing our areas of strength, enhancing our ability to grow and helping to maintain best-in-class talent across our platform. Closing, our leadership team is focused on taking meaningful actions to drive long-term value for our investors and shareholders. With that, let me now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Redett: Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. As Harvey highlighted, we delivered better-than-expected results this quarter, supported by our focus on expense management and our diversified global platform. We produced $367 million in distributable earnings or $0.87 in DE per share. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1 billion of DE or $2.38 in DE per share. We finished the third quarter with $382 billion of assets under management, up 4% year-over-year. AUM is poised to increase upon the closing of the Fortitude transaction with Lincoln, which should occur in late November. We expect this transaction to add $40 million in incremental FRE. Across our global platform, we deployed $4.1 billion of capital this quarter with nearly 1/3 in our solution strategies and over $1 billion in real estate, infrastructure and natural resources. Despite investment headwinds, we deployed $12.6 billion of capital year-to-date 2023. We realized $5.6 billion of proceeds this quarter for our LPs, largely across our energy, power, solutions and credit strategies. Year-to-date, we have returned over $15 billion in cash to our LPs, a higher level than we deployed. Carlyle is one of the few firms that has been able to deliver this outcome. We raised $6.3 billion in capital in the quarter, generally split between each of our segments. And as Harvey said, we expect a stronger fourth quarter of fundraising. In Solutions, we raised $2.4 billion largely for our secondaries and co-investment strategies, which will continue to raise capital and finalize their fundraising in 2024. In Global Credit, we attracted new capital for opportunistic credit, direct lending and our private wealth fund, CTAC. An year-to-date, we have raised nearly $1 billion for Carlyle Strategic Solutions, our asset-based finance strategy. In Global Private equity, we closed our eighth U.S. buyout fund and along with our growth sleeve, raised over $16 billion of committed capital. In addition, we raised capital across the latest vintage NGP strategy, Asia buyout and renewables. Shifting to fee-related earnings. Management fees totaled $518 million in the third quarter, up modestly compared to the prior year. We have $10 billion of pending fee-earning AUM that will activate fees largely as we deploy additional capital. Capital markets activity remained slow and transaction and advisory fees of $11 million declined sharply from last year. That said, we expect Q4 transaction revenue to grow as we have good visibility into near-term fee generation. Fee-related performance revenue of $23 million were higher than the third quarter of last year, but as we previously signaled, it declined sequentially. Global Credit FRPR continue to move higher with good asset flows and strong performance in our evergreen products, while Global Private Equity declined sequentially, a trend that is likely to persist in Q4. Cash compensation and benefits of $256 million declined more than $30 million compared to the second quarter due to lower fee-related performance revenue compensation as well as our efforts to operate the firm more efficiently. To date, we have actioned approximately $40 million in annual run rate expense savings. Our work here remains in the early innings. G&A expenses were also lower as we benefited from expense discipline and lower fundraising costs. We expect G&A expense to modestly increase in Q4 due to year-end seasonality that we remain focused on controlling annual expense growth in 2024. Overall, third quarter fee-related earnings of $205 million were relatively flat to the last quarter. We now expect to deliver a higher level of FRE in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half. FRE margin in the third quarter was 37%, and we remain focused on driving this margin higher over time. Our net accrued carry balance totaled $3.5 billion with a small decline from Q2 due to realizations. Our global carry fund portfolio appreciated 2% in the quarter with relative strength in infrastructure, natural resources and credit. And our real estate portfolio continued to be pressured by higher rates despite strong underlying asset performance. Wrapping up, despite the challenging backdrop, we're executing across the firm and see good opportunities across our global platform to create value for both investors and shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Could you better frame any potential timing dynamics between 3Q and 4Q gross flows? Maybe a better idea of how much AUM has already closed so far in 4Q? And then more broadly, perhaps update us on your thoughts on the potential sizing of remaining large funds in the market over the next 6 to 12 months?\nHarvey Schwartz: So as I said, Patrick, and thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're not particularly pleased with the year-to-date fundraising. I think -- and we talked about this a bit. With my arrival, one of the things that I really wanted to focus on as a new CEO and a new company was really spend a lot of time internally, having my people get to know me and then a lot of time externally. I've now met with, I think, over 200 of our investors globally in about nine months. And I can really feel the momentum building. And so we would expect a meaningful step up in fourth quarter fundraising. I can't promise these things. Market environments could be delays. But it feels quite good. And then when you think about the funds we have in the marketplace now, real estate, secondaries, Japan, I think as we come into 2024 -- and as I said, the momentum feels quite positive, and we'll see how fourth quarter shakes out, but we're feeling pretty optimistic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: I was hoping if we can dig into the expenses a little bit more -- so nice progress on expenses so far this quarter, you alluded to run rate savings, and there is more to go from there. So maybe help us frame kind of what's really run rate in the third quarter? How do you expect that to shake out into the end of the year? And then more importantly, what are your early thoughts on FRE growth and expense trajectory for next year?\nJohn Redett: Alex, it's John. As we said on our second quarter earnings call, we really want to drive our FRE margin higher. It's a key focus area for the firm. In the third quarter, we saw a slight uptick in the margin. But we -- look, we've been really focused on our expense base. I think we've made some progress. As I said earlier, we've already actioned $40 million run rate. And I expect this number quite frankly to grow as we continue to focus on expenses. And I would say, overall, we've gotten at the expenses faster than we thought we would. I've been in the CFO seat for five weeks, and I'm pretty pleased with the pace of which -- in terms of what we're getting at. Look, every single expense is on the table, I'd tell you. There is no such thing as a sacred expense, but this is very much a process. And I would just describe it as very, very early days. But overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in the third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So my question is on the CLO business. And just given that you just did the CBAM deal and you're the largest CLO manager in the world now, we thought you'd have a unique perspective on this. But as you noted, defaults are picking up off a very, very low base. I wanted your perspective on where you see them trending over the next year? And also, given the subordination inherent in the CLO, what are you thinking in terms of loss translation with the equity first loss tranches? And also, I remember this issue came up a few years ago, but are there scenarios where there could be triggers where management fees could turn off the CLO vehicles?\nHarvey Schwartz: Let me just comment on the broader nature of our CLO business. So the team has done actually an excellent job. We have an over 20-year history here in managing that business. We're quite proud of the fact that the team has taken the mantle of largest in the world. Our expectation has been implied by our comments is that we think we've been in a very benign credit environment and would expect credit to deteriorate on average from here. Having said that, from the standpoint of putting capital to work, I think it's a fantastic time to be putting capital to work. If you look at default rates, over the past couple of years, and even today, they're running low relative to average points in history. And so our full expectation is that credit would be -- that credit defaults across the industry whether it's in banking, private markets, et cetera, that you're going to see this pick up, particularly as you come into refinancing walls and later '24, '25 and '26 as long as rates stay high in markets, stay where they are, which again is our expectation. So the team is doing a really -- very, very good job of managing this. To give you a little detail strategically about how we're thinking about it. We're in the process right now investing in the business. We have a fund that's in the process of being raised, should close end of November, December, which will be a captive equity fund, which will help really support the business through growth. In terms of any specific triggers or anything like that, why don't we just take that offline, and then we'll have Dan follow up with you on those level of details.\nDaniel Harris: I'm happy to do so. Craig, I'll give you a call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: As we think about fundraising and energy, NGP 13 seems to have had a strong start and the performance of prior vintages seems to be quite good. I think NGP 12 was a smaller fund, could 13 be a record-sized natural resource fund for Carlyle? And then you had good realizations in energy this past quarter. How does the pipeline look for energy realizations as we look out over the next few quarters?\nHarvey Schwartz: So I think the teams have done an excellent job. Our Europe-based team, I think, in particular, has done an excellent job in terms of monetizations and the opportunity set. This area, when you look across our entire complex of energy, infrastructure, renewables, I really think we have sort of a unique team and sort of our capability set. So I think broadly speaking, this is an opportunity for growth. I'm not going to get into specifics about particular monetization because obviously that's subject to market environment. But I can tell you, we feel quite confident with the team and their performance, and they continue to do an excellent job. So it's too difficult for me to point specifically to individual asset monetizations, but the pipeline feels pretty good. I think more importantly, the breadth of the team. And when we think about the opportunity set and trends over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years, we feel really, really well positioned. And I think you could broadly discuss this in terms of energy transition and climate. I think we have some very talented folks on the ground.\nOperator: Next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So I appreciate -- I think you dangled some optimistic comments about some products being developed in both insurance and private wealth. And you gave us some -- a lot to chew on in terms of all your dry powder and seeking investments. So my question is just more strategic. Do the individual businesses have plans that it targets goals that they're working on? And the question is, when do we outsiders get a glimpse of you bringing that all together and how to think about the next couple of years? I appreciate that you -- you came in midstream in this, Harvey, but it's been a long wait for investors.\nHarvey Schwartz: That's fine. It's my responsibility, Glenn. I appreciate the question. So let's just go back to sort of how I think about it and how the team thinks about it. And our approach really is, what I'll call, not to sound boring, our textbook as principles based. And by that, I mean, there's a very methodical process that we're going through that ranges from business reviews, interactions with LPs, making sure we have all the adjacencies where we think we can provide the most value to our investors, how we can drive growth, how we can manage expenses and how we want to create operating flexibility across the entire platform. So all those things are in process. In terms of specific areas of growth and progress we've made to date, I feel really good about the momentum. If you and I were catching up back in February and you had said, hey, Harvey, where do you think the team would be with you in November. I don't think we would have made this much progress. I don't -- nobody -- I'm not patting anybody in the back here, but I don't know that we would have transitioned the CFO, put in a new Head of Technology, brought in a new Head of Distribution, brought in a new Head of Wealth and really begun to shape the architecture of the firm in a way, which I think really allows the firm and the entire leadership team to mobilize the firm. So I feel really good about that. In terms of update, what you call yourself an outsider, update for outsiders. As I've said to you before, that's really a -- to me, that's an output and we have to run this very sort of surgically methodical process. But the foundation is really coming together quite well. And so we'll come back to you as soon as we're ready to hit. But to me, that's an output. And the last thing I'll say is I truly appreciate your urgency around this. I can promise you, John, myself, the whole leadership team, folks in the businesses, we have way more urgency than you do. So as soon as we're in a position to do all that, we will. I know it's not a great answer for you, but that's our process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I wanted to ask on private credit. Just curious how you see the impact of the new proposed bank capital rules on the opportunity set for private credit? And in particular, which product areas do you anticipate banks pulling back from the most? And which areas and which opportunities that's you think are most attractive for Carlyle versus which areas may be less attractive? And maybe you could talk to some of the steps you may need to take in order to capture the opportunities set. Are there any areas you need to fill in a bit more?\nHarvey Schwartz: Sure. So I think as you all know, I was the Chief Financial Officer at Goldman from 2012 to 2017. And so that was really the first significant wave of regulatory change that came through the banking system. And so I saw that process upclose. I would expect this process to be similar across the entire banking system, particularly on the back of Silicon Valley Bank, Republic Bank, et cetera. And so my expectation, and I'd say there's a very wide distribution of potential outcomes here, but I'll give you my personal expectation. My personal expectation is there'll be sort of a flurry of activity, maybe one-off transactions. We're involved in several dialogues on our side, but I think you'll see a flurry of activity. But I really think this is a process that really plays out two, three, four, five years. And I think it really is as simple as the regulatory community doing their job to identify where they feel their systemic risk and really not the best liability asset management, which we've seen already in a number of cases. And in private markets, as you know, we have long-term capital and the ability to deploy that capital. So I think there's sort of two phase. It's like a quick phase where you see maybe a flurry transactions over the next year. And then you see a longer term settling in where we, as Carlyle and other market participants, we can provide -- we provide very valuable capital to borrowers and to the economy. Where that plays out? I think that's in the full gamut. I mean, we've already seen it sort of in leveraged loans and sponsor lending, that's a multiyear. That's an old process. And I think it will continue to extend to those most heavily weighted -- risk-weighted assets, could be in the asset-backed market. You could see things in consumer loans. Certainly, this is going to take multiple years, but we're going to have to work through as an economy and as a system, the real estate debt that exists out there. So I think it's going to be very broad based. But I actually think, again, the longer-term opportunity set ends up playing out over multiple years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: So I appreciate the focus on expenses and definitely encouraging to hear your messaging there. So curious how you strike a balance in between discipline and efficiency? And I believe there were some onetime items in private equity in the quarter. Could you maybe help us size those so we can understand what the right base is to think about moving forward?\nJohn Redett: Yes, Brennan, it's John. Look, we're very focused on expenses, but we're more focused on growth. We do see more opportunity for some expense savings. We're not going to be cutting anywhere near the point to where it impacts growth. We're very focused on growth. In terms of the G&A, I would describe the beat of kind of $20 million-ish as roughly $5 million was more a result of our focus in work around G&A expenses. The rest of the $20 million beat -- the $15 million-ish was really more one-off items that likely won't occur again in the fourth quarter. And as I said in my remarks, we do expect the fourth quarter G&A to trend higher than the third quarter, but we're very focused on managing our G&A number in the fourth quarter in 2024.\nHarvey Schwartz: I think John said it perfectly. I think this is about two things, high level. One is about operational excellence. And as John said earlier, there's nothing sacred. And so we're going to be exceptionally disciplined. I think the other thing is it just creates a lot of operational flexibility to invest in growth. And growth areas like wealth, parts of credit, insurance, those are areas where we're going to make sure that we have the resources to participate. But it gives us a lot of operating flexibility. I'm really pleased what the team has done in a short period of time to come up with $40 million of run rate savings, which we'll keep building on, I think, is -- again, I give them a lot of credit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: And, John, thanks for the -- just building on, I guess, on the last answer on the expense side, thanks for the nonrecurring disclosure there. The $40 million run rate savings is -- if you can just talk about, is that starting in the fourth quarter or is that partially in the third quarter? And then just as more structurally as we move into 2024, I think you mentioned you think you're in the early innings in this regard. Any sense of whether that -- you think that you can keep that line either flat or down? I know you definitely want to invest for growth. And then just any commentary around that $40 million between G&A and compensation and whether any change to the compensation structure is contemplated for 2024 or is being worked on at this stage?\nJohn Redett: Yes. Brian, it's John. I would think of this more as a 2024 run rate number. I mean, look, I've been in the seat five weeks, as I said earlier, and we really just started this process. That's why I kind of referred to it as the early innings of this kind of expense review process. In terms of competition, I mean, look, we're a human capital business. Our largest expense is obviously compensation. It's certainly something that we're very focused on. We're very aware of what our competitors have done on the compensation front. And I would just say it's part of the overall expense review going forward. And again, look, I think in overall, the $40 million number is largely comp-driven, compensation-driven and kind of, I would say, 15% of it's roughly G&A.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Mckenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: So Investment Solutions is in the middle of a strong fundraising cycle. And we should see some nice expansion into 2024. But how should we think about growth here longer term? And are there any other strategic opportunities within this business away from the core strategies that could drive some incremental growth over time?\nHarvey Schwartz: Look, so the short answer to that is yes. So it's -- look, it's a fantastic team. It's a great business. It's kind of where the puck is, right? Primary across the industry is a little slower. Secondary activity is a lot higher. Our expectation is that all be sustained for a while. There are a number of different business adjacencies that fit nicely here that the team is growing and building. So I would expect to see this as an area of growth over the next several years, and we have a fantastic team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: I wanted to ask on the FRE margin outlook? And maybe just at the risk of being a dead horse, just want to ask on expenses and dig in a bit further, whether the $40 million of run rate cost savings contemplate any incremental investment? So whether it's a gross versus net savings figure, given you do have a lot of growth priorities as well, Harvey, that you outlined? And how we should think about the trajectory for FRE margins in '24 versus this quarter's jumping off point, given the realization of some of those efficiency benefits?\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes. So I mean, John talked on fair bit of this. I think -- I don't want to disappoint you, but we're not going to give you real specifics on 2024. I would tell you that there's a couple of levers that we're working on, which when we're ready, we'll dig into a little bit more. But I would say there's sort of three very, very big, high-level things happening. One is the run rate savings. And while that's meaningful, and I'm really proud, this is not just about cutting expenses. When you look at the transaction that the team has completed in Insurance. As you look at that transaction over the next two years, that will drive about $40 million of incremental FRE adjust in that transaction. In the undrawn capital that John talked about, that will drive about $90 million of top line fees, the $10 billion. So there's a lot happening in terms of FRE growth. And then, of course, you have the fundraising that we've talked about. And as I said, I feel really good about the momentum. I don't know I thought I would nine months in. But there's work to do. There's a lot of work to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Harvey, you mentioned private wealth as an area that you can be much larger in $3 billion year-to-date in close. Can you talk about what's in the market today? And then how you see that evolving from a product perspective and what you think is a reasonable goal in terms of organic growth from that channel?\nHarvey Schwartz: So I'm really enthusiastic about this as a long-term area of growth for Carlyle. We've had products in the market for a long time. As I mentioned, we've raised $45 billion across closed and evergreen funds. The wealth team has grown pretty substantially, but there's more work to do on product development, growth of the team. We're investing quite heavily. I'm personally spending a fair bit of time in this space. And it really became a big initiative for me in, I don't know, month six or month seven. And I feel very optimistic here. I think as an industry, we have to be really thoughtful as capital continues to migrate into the sector. I think if you look at the wealth assets around the world, which we all expect will continue to grow, it's a very small percentage in alternatives. So this is going to play out over a decade. But as this growth happens, I think Carlyle, the brand recognition, the history of the firm, the historic presence of the founders, David Rubenstein, brand in and of itself. I think these are all really, really additive, powerful things that provide momentum for Carlyle, but this is going to play out over years. I think most importantly, we just have to have the right products to ensure that the wealth investor gets really high performance, and that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays.\nBen Budish: I wanted to follow up sort of on the discussion of investing for growth versus kind of cost savings. Harvey, you mentioned a number of sort of growth areas, private credit and the asset-backed opportunity. Insurance, you talked about developing new investment and distribution strategies. And earlier, you talked about the kind of the progress you made in terms of hiring. So can we kind of circling back to all of that. In terms of the future hiring, future growth, do you feel like you have the capabilities you need to sort of go after those opportunity sets or where might you need to kind of increase hiring? Is it on the investment side, the distribution side? Or do you feel like you can kind of do what you want to do with what you have?\nHarvey Schwartz: So -- well, first of all, I think the team is amazing. Broadly speaking, I've been so impressed since I got here with the business leaders. World-class organizations, they know how to redeploy resources and how to effectively tap the brakes, hit the gas. We're not creating new science over here in terms of how we think about expense management and reinvestment. And as I said, the key here is to create operational flexibility. We're not just trying to drive the cost structure down. We want to make sure that we have the best people, retain the best people, attract the best people. So all this is about creating that operational flexibility. The insurance team is really vastly built out through our partners in Fortitude. I think over time as well scales will continue to scale, but we made meaningful investment there. And I think the investing engine in credit is broadly built out. Some of this will be more about at the margin. But I don't see as much investments or big gaping holes at this stage. So certainly, things will build. And the world is going to be dynamic. And so we'll pivot to where it's dynamic. But we're certainly very focused on growth, but we're equally focused on running this business in the most disciplined possible way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Maybe Harvey, if you could just give us an update on the capital markets business. I know that's an area you have been focused on. Where you think there's a lot of opportunity for Carlyle and the product set that you have and the talent you have, right, currently? Maybe as we move into 2024, is that an area where you think you can significantly build the revenue stream on a year-over-year basis provided, of course, that we have a fairly normal market environment? Or is that more of a little bit of a longer-term build?\nHarvey Schwartz: No, I don't think it's a longer-term build. We don't want to be the biggest in the world here in capital markets. And that's really more my feeling for the strategy, but we're coming from such a low base that incremental growth in a normalized market environment should be pretty easy. If we don't deliver that for you, then we're not doing our job. So I think, John mentioned it was a pretty muted quarter, but fourth quarter pipeline feels pretty good coming into 2024 in a more normalized environment. I think we have the team now positioned in a way, aligned with the businesses in terms of resources and incentives and degree of focus that I think that the opportunity set should be much better coming into '24, again, subject to market conditions. Now I would describe it as a Version 1.0. When we get to a Version 2.0, we'll come back to you in terms of how we build that out. But a lot of this, as I've said before, we have all the raw material. We just need to leverage all the adjacencies we have internally, have the right incentives, stay focused and then we can drive value through this.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Can I ask one more or just should I get back in the queue?\nHarvey Schwartz: You got to talk to Dan Harris about that. I let you ask, although you asked already before, but they can't give you the opportunity about that, but I'll. That's a kind of guy I'm.\nBrian Bedell: It will be a quick one. Just on the fundraising side, obviously, optimistic on 4Q. Are we still in the camp for fundraising in 2023 to exceed that of 2022? Or do you think the timing could be sort of squishy around the December, January time frame where they might bump into '24 a little bit?\nHarvey Schwartz: No. Our expectations will exceed 2022 subject to market conditions and some stuff flipping. And the other thing I'll say is we're trying to give you as much insights, but we're not running the place for November, December, right? So we're running it for the long term. But I understand your focus on the quarter.\nBrian Bedell: No, no, that's good, that's good. Great.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Harvey, you mentioned the still uncertain environment. So could you maybe better frame how the 4Q realization pipeline looks versus 3Q?\nJohn Redett: Yes. I mean -- it's John. Look, it's obviously a difficult question to answer in the sense we're in some challenging markets. But look, I would say confidence is low today. Uncertainty is elevated. And as Harvey said, we have a lot of dry powder. I like the fact that we have a lot of dry powder. Some of the better investments we've made at Carlyle have been in markets where uncertainty is elevated like today. So I think we feel good about that. But looking forward, projecting realizations is something that's very difficult for us to do.\nOperator: And I'd now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Harris for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Yes. Thanks, everybody. We appreciate your time this morning and, of course, your interest in Carlyle. If you have any further questions or follow-ups, please reach out to Investor Relations. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll update you on the areas where we have strong momentum and where we're focused on accelerating growth. Before getting into that, let me touch on the macro. An already complex environment has become increasingly uncertain with the tragic events unfolding in the Middle East. Multiple wars, along with higher rates and economic uncertainty has increased volatility and reduced confidence levels. As we all know, sentiment is the greatest market elixir, and negative sentiment has slowed transaction activity over the past year. That said, despite the challenging market backdrop, deal activity has shown signs of improvement as third quarter buyout activity was at the highest pace in over a year. However, my own opinion is that lower activity levels and reduced confidence will likely persist for a bit longer. As we said in the past, our view is that rates will stay higher for longer. After 20 years of declining rates and central bank market intervention, the overall cost of capital has shifted higher and may remain so for some time. Market participants have reluctantly accepted this reality and begun repricing assets based on this outcome. However, as is often the case in market regime shifts, this process of market digestion will take time. Ultimately, higher rates could dampen economic activity. Complex and uncertain environments don't necessarily mean a lack of opportunity as we've seen over decades navigating through all market cycles. Our goal investment teams continue to stay focused on generating excess alpha in this market environment. And with over $70 billion of dry powder across our platform, we have the flexibility to deploy capital and build on strategic partnerships. Now let me shift to areas of focus as we position the firm for growth. First, our insurance strategy has very strong underlying momentum. Fortitude's announced transaction with Lincoln Financial has met all closing conditions and is expected to close later this month. We will pick up approximately $24 billion in new AUM from the increase in Fortitude's general account assets as well as additional capital that rotates into Carlyle funds. In addition to this transaction, our team is developing new investment and distribution strategies that target the needs of insurance investors and our private credit business. We see substantial growth and potential new transactions across the insurance vertical. Next, private wealth. The Carlyle brand has always been received well in the private wealth channel, and we're building on that momentum. We have raised over $45 billion from this channel over time. And this year, we have raised more than $3 billion. I feel good about this channel given the strength of our brand. Over the coming quarters and years, we expect to accelerate product development and see further growth in sales and distribution. There's a lot of upside in private wealth, and we expect our footprint to be significantly larger in coming years. Moving on, we're seeing momentum across several of our investment strategies in the market today. A few examples include Japan buyout, U.S. real estate and secondaries. Each of these strategies are on track to grow meaningfully due to strong investment performance, our deep client relationships and an attractive set of deployment opportunities. During the quarter, we raised $6.3 billion in new capital, bringing year-to-date fundraising to $20 billion. Overall, we've not been pleased with our pace of fundraising thus far in 2023, but our current expectation is for a step higher in new capital raise throughout the fourth quarter. With the final close of our latest U.S. buyout strategy, we now have $105 billion of corporate private equity assets under management, including $21 billion in dry powder across our CP funds that allow us to pursue deals of any size around the globe. We continue to raise capital for next vintage Asia, Europe and Japan buyout strategies, which should further add to this amount in the coming quarters. Moving to credit. This is an area we're focused on accelerating our growth and expect to be significantly larger over time. Global Credit has built a diverse set of strategies to serve an increasing number of institutional and private wealth LPs to manage over $150 billion in assets today, nearly triple the level of just three years ago, including the world's largest CLO business. Our team is focused on the significant opportunity ahead to attract assets that migrate from bank balance sheets to private capital strategies, a trend we expect to play out over the next several years. Finally, let me focus on expense management. We have made faster progress in this area than I originally expected. I give a lot of credit to the team for driving this process. We've identified several areas that have already led to a lower run rate of expenses. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected third quarter FRE. I expect an even larger impact in 2024. The changes we're making across the firm are improving our organizational structure, emphasizing our areas of strength, enhancing our ability to grow and helping to maintain best-in-class talent across our platform. Closing, our leadership team is focused on taking meaningful actions to drive long-term value for our investors and shareholders. With that, let me now turn the call over to John. So as I said, Patrick, and thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're not particularly pleased with the year-to-date fundraising. I think -- and we talked about this a bit. With my arrival, one of the things that I really wanted to focus on as a new CEO and a new company was really spend a lot of time internally, having my people get to know me and then a lot of time externally. I've now met with, I think, over 200 of our investors globally in about nine months. And I can really feel the momentum building. And so we would expect a meaningful step up in fourth quarter fundraising. I can't promise these things. Market environments could be delays. But it feels quite good. And then when you think about the funds we have in the marketplace now, real estate, secondaries, Japan, I think as we come into 2024 -- and as I said, the momentum feels quite positive, and we'll see how fourth quarter shakes out, but we're feeling pretty optimistic. Let me just comment on the broader nature of our CLO business. So the team has done actually an excellent job. We have an over 20-year history here in managing that business. We're quite proud of the fact that the team has taken the mantle of largest in the world. Our expectation has been implied by our comments is that we think we've been in a very benign credit environment and would expect credit to deteriorate on average from here. Having said that, from the standpoint of putting capital to work, I think it's a fantastic time to be putting capital to work. If you look at default rates, over the past couple of years, and even today, they're running low relative to average points in history. And so our full expectation is that credit would be -- that credit defaults across the industry whether it's in banking, private markets, et cetera, that you're going to see this pick up, particularly as you come into refinancing walls and later '24, '25 and '26 as long as rates stay high in markets, stay where they are, which again is our expectation. So the team is doing a really -- very, very good job of managing this. To give you a little detail strategically about how we're thinking about it. We're in the process right now investing in the business. We have a fund that's in the process of being raised, should close end of November, December, which will be a captive equity fund, which will help really support the business through growth. In terms of any specific triggers or anything like that, why don't we just take that offline, and then we'll have Dan follow up with you on those level of details. So I think the teams have done an excellent job. Our Europe-based team, I think, in particular, has done an excellent job in terms of monetizations and the opportunity set. This area, when you look across our entire complex of energy, infrastructure, renewables, I really think we have sort of a unique team and sort of our capability set. So I think broadly speaking, this is an opportunity for growth. I'm not going to get into specifics about particular monetization because obviously that's subject to market environment. But I can tell you, we feel quite confident with the team and their performance, and they continue to do an excellent job. So it's too difficult for me to point specifically to individual asset monetizations, but the pipeline feels pretty good. I think more importantly, the breadth of the team. And when we think about the opportunity set and trends over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years, we feel really, really well positioned. And I think you could broadly discuss this in terms of energy transition and climate. I think we have some very talented folks on the ground. That's fine. It's my responsibility, Glenn. I appreciate the question. So let's just go back to sort of how I think about it and how the team thinks about it. And our approach really is, what I'll call, not to sound boring, our textbook as principles based. And by that, I mean, there's a very methodical process that we're going through that ranges from business reviews, interactions with LPs, making sure we have all the adjacencies where we think we can provide the most value to our investors, how we can drive growth, how we can manage expenses and how we want to create operating flexibility across the entire platform. So all those things are in process. In terms of specific areas of growth and progress we've made to date, I feel really good about the momentum. If you and I were catching up back in February and you had said, hey, Harvey, where do you think the team would be with you in November. I don't think we would have made this much progress. I don't -- nobody -- I'm not patting anybody in the back here, but I don't know that we would have transitioned the CFO, put in a new Head of Technology, brought in a new Head of Distribution, brought in a new Head of Wealth and really begun to shape the architecture of the firm in a way, which I think really allows the firm and the entire leadership team to mobilize the firm. So I feel really good about that. In terms of update, what you call yourself an outsider, update for outsiders. As I've said to you before, that's really a -- to me, that's an output and we have to run this very sort of surgically methodical process. But the foundation is really coming together quite well. And so we'll come back to you as soon as we're ready to hit. But to me, that's an output. And the last thing I'll say is I truly appreciate your urgency around this. I can promise you, John, myself, the whole leadership team, folks in the businesses, we have way more urgency than you do. So as soon as we're in a position to do all that, we will. I know it's not a great answer for you, but that's our process. Sure. So I think as you all know, I was the Chief Financial Officer at Goldman from 2012 to 2017. And so that was really the first significant wave of regulatory change that came through the banking system. And so I saw that process upclose. I would expect this process to be similar across the entire banking system, particularly on the back of Silicon Valley Bank, Republic Bank, et cetera. And so my expectation, and I'd say there's a very wide distribution of potential outcomes here, but I'll give you my personal expectation. My personal expectation is there'll be sort of a flurry of activity, maybe one-off transactions. We're involved in several dialogues on our side, but I think you'll see a flurry of activity. But I really think this is a process that really plays out two, three, four, five years. And I think it really is as simple as the regulatory community doing their job to identify where they feel their systemic risk and really not the best liability asset management, which we've seen already in a number of cases. And in private markets, as you know, we have long-term capital and the ability to deploy that capital. So I think there's sort of two phase. It's like a quick phase where you see maybe a flurry transactions over the next year. And then you see a longer term settling in where we, as Carlyle and other market participants, we can provide -- we provide very valuable capital to borrowers and to the economy. Where that plays out? I think that's in the full gamut. I mean, we've already seen it sort of in leveraged loans and sponsor lending, that's a multiyear. That's an old process. And I think it will continue to extend to those most heavily weighted -- risk-weighted assets, could be in the asset-backed market. You could see things in consumer loans. Certainly, this is going to take multiple years, but we're going to have to work through as an economy and as a system, the real estate debt that exists out there. So I think it's going to be very broad based. But I actually think, again, the longer-term opportunity set ends up playing out over multiple years. I think John said it perfectly. I think this is about two things, high level. One is about operational excellence. And as John said earlier, there's nothing sacred. And so we're going to be exceptionally disciplined. I think the other thing is it just creates a lot of operational flexibility to invest in growth. And growth areas like wealth, parts of credit, insurance, those are areas where we're going to make sure that we have the resources to participate. But it gives us a lot of operating flexibility. I'm really pleased what the team has done in a short period of time to come up with $40 million of run rate savings, which we'll keep building on, I think, is -- again, I give them a lot of credit. Look, so the short answer to that is yes. So it's -- look, it's a fantastic team. It's a great business. It's kind of where the puck is, right? Primary across the industry is a little slower. Secondary activity is a lot higher. Our expectation is that all be sustained for a while. There are a number of different business adjacencies that fit nicely here that the team is growing and building. So I would expect to see this as an area of growth over the next several years, and we have a fantastic team. Yes. So I mean, John talked on fair bit of this. I think -- I don't want to disappoint you, but we're not going to give you real specifics on 2024. I would tell you that there's a couple of levers that we're working on, which when we're ready, we'll dig into a little bit more. But I would say there's sort of three very, very big, high-level things happening. One is the run rate savings. And while that's meaningful, and I'm really proud, this is not just about cutting expenses. When you look at the transaction that the team has completed in Insurance. As you look at that transaction over the next two years, that will drive about $40 million of incremental FRE adjust in that transaction. In the undrawn capital that John talked about, that will drive about $90 million of top line fees, the $10 billion. So there's a lot happening in terms of FRE growth. And then, of course, you have the fundraising that we've talked about. And as I said, I feel really good about the momentum. I don't know I thought I would nine months in. But there's work to do. There's a lot of work to do. So I'm really enthusiastic about this as a long-term area of growth for Carlyle. We've had products in the market for a long time. As I mentioned, we've raised $45 billion across closed and evergreen funds. The wealth team has grown pretty substantially, but there's more work to do on product development, growth of the team. We're investing quite heavily. I'm personally spending a fair bit of time in this space. And it really became a big initiative for me in, I don't know, month six or month seven. And I feel very optimistic here. I think as an industry, we have to be really thoughtful as capital continues to migrate into the sector. I think if you look at the wealth assets around the world, which we all expect will continue to grow, it's a very small percentage in alternatives. So this is going to play out over a decade. But as this growth happens, I think Carlyle, the brand recognition, the history of the firm, the historic presence of the founders, David Rubenstein, brand in and of itself. I think these are all really, really additive, powerful things that provide momentum for Carlyle, but this is going to play out over years. I think most importantly, we just have to have the right products to ensure that the wealth investor gets really high performance, and that's what we're focused on. So -- well, first of all, I think the team is amazing. Broadly speaking, I've been so impressed since I got here with the business leaders. World-class organizations, they know how to redeploy resources and how to effectively tap the brakes, hit the gas. We're not creating new science over here in terms of how we think about expense management and reinvestment. And as I said, the key here is to create operational flexibility. We're not just trying to drive the cost structure down. We want to make sure that we have the best people, retain the best people, attract the best people. So all this is about creating that operational flexibility. The insurance team is really vastly built out through our partners in Fortitude. I think over time as well scales will continue to scale, but we made meaningful investment there. And I think the investing engine in credit is broadly built out. Some of this will be more about at the margin. But I don't see as much investments or big gaping holes at this stage. So certainly, things will build. And the world is going to be dynamic. And so we'll pivot to where it's dynamic. But we're certainly very focused on growth, but we're equally focused on running this business in the most disciplined possible way. No, I don't think it's a longer-term build. We don't want to be the biggest in the world here in capital markets. And that's really more my feeling for the strategy, but we're coming from such a low base that incremental growth in a normalized market environment should be pretty easy. If we don't deliver that for you, then we're not doing our job. So I think, John mentioned it was a pretty muted quarter, but fourth quarter pipeline feels pretty good coming into 2024 in a more normalized environment. I think we have the team now positioned in a way, aligned with the businesses in terms of resources and incentives and degree of focus that I think that the opportunity set should be much better coming into '24, again, subject to market conditions. Now I would describe it as a Version 1.0. When we get to a Version 2.0, we'll come back to you in terms of how we build that out. But a lot of this, as I've said before, we have all the raw material. We just need to leverage all the adjacencies we have internally, have the right incentives, stay focused and then we can drive value through this. You got to talk to Dan Harris about that. I let you ask, although you asked already before, but they can't give you the opportunity about that, but I'll. That's a kind of guy I'm. No. Our expectations will exceed 2022 subject to market conditions and some stuff flipping. And the other thing I'll say is we're trying to give you as much insights, but we're not running the place for November, December, right? So we're running it for the long term. But I understand your focus on the quarter."

            "name": "John Redett",
            "content": "Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. As Harvey highlighted, we delivered better-than-expected results this quarter, supported by our focus on expense management and our diversified global platform. We produced $367 million in distributable earnings or $0.87 in DE per share. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1 billion of DE or $2.38 in DE per share. We finished the third quarter with $382 billion of assets under management, up 4% year-over-year. AUM is poised to increase upon the closing of the Fortitude transaction with Lincoln, which should occur in late November. We expect this transaction to add $40 million in incremental FRE. Across our global platform, we deployed $4.1 billion of capital this quarter with nearly 1/3 in our solution strategies and over $1 billion in real estate, infrastructure and natural resources. Despite investment headwinds, we deployed $12.6 billion of capital year-to-date 2023. We realized $5.6 billion of proceeds this quarter for our LPs, largely across our energy, power, solutions and credit strategies. Year-to-date, we have returned over $15 billion in cash to our LPs, a higher level than we deployed. Carlyle is one of the few firms that has been able to deliver this outcome. We raised $6.3 billion in capital in the quarter, generally split between each of our segments. And as Harvey said, we expect a stronger fourth quarter of fundraising. In Solutions, we raised $2.4 billion largely for our secondaries and co-investment strategies, which will continue to raise capital and finalize their fundraising in 2024. In Global Credit, we attracted new capital for opportunistic credit, direct lending and our private wealth fund, CTAC. An year-to-date, we have raised nearly $1 billion for Carlyle Strategic Solutions, our asset-based finance strategy. In Global Private equity, we closed our eighth U.S. buyout fund and along with our growth sleeve, raised over $16 billion of committed capital. In addition, we raised capital across the latest vintage NGP strategy, Asia buyout and renewables. Shifting to fee-related earnings. Management fees totaled $518 million in the third quarter, up modestly compared to the prior year. We have $10 billion of pending fee-earning AUM that will activate fees largely as we deploy additional capital. Capital markets activity remained slow and transaction and advisory fees of $11 million declined sharply from last year. That said, we expect Q4 transaction revenue to grow as we have good visibility into near-term fee generation. Fee-related performance revenue of $23 million were higher than the third quarter of last year, but as we previously signaled, it declined sequentially. Global Credit FRPR continue to move higher with good asset flows and strong performance in our evergreen products, while Global Private Equity declined sequentially, a trend that is likely to persist in Q4. Cash compensation and benefits of $256 million declined more than $30 million compared to the second quarter due to lower fee-related performance revenue compensation as well as our efforts to operate the firm more efficiently. To date, we have actioned approximately $40 million in annual run rate expense savings. Our work here remains in the early innings. G&A expenses were also lower as we benefited from expense discipline and lower fundraising costs. We expect G&A expense to modestly increase in Q4 due to year-end seasonality that we remain focused on controlling annual expense growth in 2024. Overall, third quarter fee-related earnings of $205 million were relatively flat to the last quarter. We now expect to deliver a higher level of FRE in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half. FRE margin in the third quarter was 37%, and we remain focused on driving this margin higher over time. Our net accrued carry balance totaled $3.5 billion with a small decline from Q2 due to realizations. Our global carry fund portfolio appreciated 2% in the quarter with relative strength in infrastructure, natural resources and credit. And our real estate portfolio continued to be pressured by higher rates despite strong underlying asset performance. Wrapping up, despite the challenging backdrop, we're executing across the firm and see good opportunities across our global platform to create value for both investors and shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Alex, it's John. As we said on our second quarter earnings call, we really want to drive our FRE margin higher. It's a key focus area for the firm. In the third quarter, we saw a slight uptick in the margin. But we -- look, we've been really focused on our expense base. I think we've made some progress. As I said earlier, we've already actioned $40 million run rate. And I expect this number quite frankly to grow as we continue to focus on expenses. And I would say, overall, we've gotten at the expenses faster than we thought we would. I've been in the CFO seat for five weeks, and I'm pretty pleased with the pace of which -- in terms of what we're getting at. Look, every single expense is on the table, I'd tell you. There is no such thing as a sacred expense, but this is very much a process. And I would just describe it as very, very early days. But overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in the third quarter. Yes, Brennan, it's John. Look, we're very focused on expenses, but we're more focused on growth. We do see more opportunity for some expense savings. We're not going to be cutting anywhere near the point to where it impacts growth. We're very focused on growth. In terms of the G&A, I would describe the beat of kind of $20 million-ish as roughly $5 million was more a result of our focus in work around G&A expenses. The rest of the $20 million beat -- the $15 million-ish was really more one-off items that likely won't occur again in the fourth quarter. And as I said in my remarks, we do expect the fourth quarter G&A to trend higher than the third quarter, but we're very focused on managing our G&A number in the fourth quarter in 2024. Yes. Brian, it's John. I would think of this more as a 2024 run rate number. I mean, look, I've been in the seat five weeks, as I said earlier, and we really just started this process. That's why I kind of referred to it as the early innings of this kind of expense review process. In terms of competition, I mean, look, we're a human capital business. Our largest expense is obviously compensation. It's certainly something that we're very focused on. We're very aware of what our competitors have done on the compensation front. And I would just say it's part of the overall expense review going forward. And again, look, I think in overall, the $40 million number is largely comp-driven, compensation-driven and kind of, I would say, 15% of it's roughly G&A. Yes. I mean -- it's John. Look, it's obviously a difficult question to answer in the sense we're in some challenging markets. But look, I would say confidence is low today. Uncertainty is elevated. And as Harvey said, we have a lot of dry powder. I like the fact that we have a lot of dry powder. Some of the better investments we've made at Carlyle have been in markets where uncertainty is elevated like today. So I think we feel good about that. But looking forward, projecting realizations is something that's very difficult for us to do."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Norma. Good morning and welcome to Carlyle's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz; Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser; and incoming Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Strategy, John Redett. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation which is also available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release to the extent reasonably available. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. So turning to our results. For the second quarter, we generated $207 million in fee-related earnings and $389 million in distributable earnings with DE per common share of $0.88. Our carry balance was $3.7 billion as of the end of the quarter and we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share. In order to ensure participation by all those on the line today, please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue for any additional follow-ups. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm excited to be joined today by John Redett who you'll hear from later as well as Curt. There are 2 areas I'd like to cover. First, the for macro environment; and second, a review of several work streams that will position us to drive long-term growth. First, the macro environment. As I've said previously, we're in one of the most complex periods in recent economic history. The combination of sustained elevated inflation along with central bank rate hikes has led to a corresponding increase in the cost of capital. The peak of the inflationary cycle may have passed but our base case is that rates stay higher for longer as we shift away from a decade of 0 interest rate policy. It remains early days in understanding the impact of this shift on corporate capital structures and liquidity. Among other factors, this shift in interest rates further contributes to mixed investor appetite and sentiment. In part, our economic and market views are informed by the vast data and proprietary insights gathered from our portfolio. The data set includes nearly 300 global companies, 600 real estate investments. And loans to over 1,300 issuers. Let's start with inflation. We're starting to see it's more difficult for our portfolio companies to pass through increased cost, reinforcing the view that the inflationary cycle has peaked. Our portfolio company CEOs remain generally cautious in terms of how they're approaching the operating environment but broadly, our portfolios have seen accelerating activity with over 10% EBITDA growth. As you'd expect, these economic forces have slowed the pace of investment across the industry. You see this in the amount of capital we are deploying and you see it in lower fundraising LPs slow decision-making on new fund allocations. Having said that, in general, our teams are seeing signs of an increasing pace of early deal flow access across most asset classes. Now I want to update you on 5 key areas that we are focused on as a leadership team. Though these are just a sample of activities around the firm. We have mobilized teams and launched work streams for each of these. As you'd expect we are approaching these in a very deliberate and methodical manner. And while early, let me give you a line of sight into what we're doing. First, our Insurance Solutions business. Our relationship with Fortitude is profitable, strategic and vital but only one piece in the opportunity set. As insurance companies look to free up capital and shift liabilities to improve their ROE, we're seeing a greater interest on their part to partner with us in a variety of important ways. Second, our capital markets team. They also have a large opportunity to scale their impact. We have in place today all the key ingredients for growth, a well-positioned and active private equity franchise and an experienced capital markets team. As activity rates pick up, we expect that we will further leverage our deal flow and our portfolio companies need for capital to create a natural tailwind in this business. Third we're also focused on our technology and our AI strategy. This allows us to create operational efficiencies across the firm as well as at our portfolio companies and is an important driver of growth and scale over the long term. We recently appointed the CS Juarez as our new Chief Information Officer and Head of Technology Transformation. She will work closely with the entire leadership team to drive technology transformation strategy and operations. Now fourth, as we said before, we see long-term opportunity around private wealth. We've recently hired a new Head of Private Wealth strategy. While we only have 3 products in the market covering 5 billion of assets today, we view this as an important channel for growth. We'll be working with our distribution partners to bring product innovation globally to the Wealth Cal. Most importantly, the Carlyle brand is a huge differentiator here. And fifth, the last work stream I'll mention is around expense management and improving FRE margin. This means investing in our platform wisely to drive top line growth, as well as closely monitoring the overall level and composition of expense as well as the capital required to run the firm. This is a critical strategic effort. We will continue to move with a disciplined sense of urgency around each one of these and we'll continue to update you as these progress. To close, as I said, we're still operating within a somewhat challenging market backdrop. It's important to state that we will be patient when we need to be, while at the same time, capitalizing on opportunities to deploy capital where we see attractive risk reward. As a leadership team, we are intensely focused on delivering performance excellence for our investors and driving long-term shareholder value. We are taking action to mobilize teams around priority areas to drive disciplined growth. and I'm really enthusiastic for Carlisle's future. Now before I hand it to John, I'd also like to take a moment to thank Curt for his tremendous contributions to Carlyle over the last nearly 20 years. I personally am thankful for Curt's counsel and support as I transitioned into Carlyle over the past 6 months and I've really enjoyed getting it on. I know you'll all join me in wishing him the best in his upcoming retirement. And now, John, over to you.\nJohn Redett: Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. I also want to thank Curt for his 20 years of leadership at Carlyle and for the guidance he continues to provide me as I transition into the CFO role. I look forward to working more closely with many of you in the coming periods. As Harvey highlighted, we delivered solid results this quarter in a tough environment, driven by a diversified investment platform and the focus of our global investment teams. We produced $389 million in distributable earnings for the second quarter or $0.88 in DE per share. Year-to-date, we have generated $660 million of DE or $1.51 in DE per share. We reached a $60 million of shares in the second quarter and have repurchased $160 million in the first half of the year. Today, I'm going to focus my remarks on 3 main areas: fee-related earnings in the near-term outlook, accrued carry and fundraising. First, fee-related earnings. Increased to $207 million in the quarter, up from $193 million in Q1 2023. Relative to the second quarter last year, FRE declined 12% as modest growth in revenue was offset by continued investment into our people and teams. Year-to-date, FRE of $401 million was down 5% compared to the same period last year. Second quarter management fees of $515 million increased sequentially after having declined for a few quarters with increases in each of our segments. Over the next few quarters, new fund launches and fee activations should support continued management fee growth. Our second quarter results benefited from $73 million in fee-related performance revenue. Looking ahead, we are not expecting to generate material fee-related performance revenue in global private equity in the second half of 2023, though global credit fee-related performance revenue should remain stable. Transaction and advisory fees were $18 million in the quarter, down significantly from a year ago, given muted capital markets activity which has pressured both FRE and the margins. And as you heard from Harvey, driving an increasing level of transaction revenue from our investment platforms is a major focus area for the firm. Compensation expense was $289 million in the second quarter an 11% increase year-over-year. A majority of the increase this quarter was a function of higher fee-related performance revenue as we generally accrue compensation at 45% of associated revenue. Excluding this impact, compensation expense increased only 5% year-over-year. G&A expense of $102 million reflects a more normalized set of firm-wide activities relative to lower levels we saw during the pandemic. This quarter also included external fundraising costs largely captured in global investment solutions which supported fundraising momentum. G&A expense may tick up in the back half of the year as we typically have increased operating costs tied to our LP conferences. With regards to our FRE outlook, second half 2023 FRE is likely to be similar in the aggregate to the first half of 2023 with a relatively stronger fourth quarter. We remain focused on generating sustainable top line revenue growth as well as diversifying and growing FRE. Moving on, I'd like to discuss our net accrued carry. Our global carry fund portfolio appreciated 2% in the quarter with relative strength in infrastructure and natural resources, owing to an uptick in announced transactions. We had more muted appreciation in private equity and real estate. Our net accrued carry balance of $3.7 billion declined from $4 billion last quarter. Most of this decline was driven by $175 million in net realizations with the balance due to a reduction in accrued carry in global private equity. Even with this decline, the net accrual remains at a robust $10 per share which is a substantial source of future shareholder value. Let me finish up with an update on fundraising. Fund investors continue to face challenging decisions and make commitments more slowly than in previous years. Despite this slowdown, we still expect to raise a larger amount of capital in 2023 than we did in 2022. Through the first half of 2023, we raised $14 billion of new capital. Approximately halfway to last year's fundraising total. We have momentum in several important strategies that should see inflows in the second half of 2023, likely weighted towards the fourth quarter. In Global Investment Solutions, we are off to a good start for our latest vintage secondaries and co-investment strategies which should both continue into the second half of the year and into 2024. This new capital will turn on management fees later this year. In Global Credit, we expect to grow off a slower start to 2023. We've priced 2 CLOs in the second quarter after none in the first quarter. Our credit opportunities fund should continue to attract more capital and a number of strategies in SMAs are positioned to generate positive flows, with the fourth quarter likely to be relatively stronger than the third quarter. In Global Private equity, we expect to raise capital in the second half of the year in several buyout funds and various real asset strategies. Wrapping up, let me reiterate my excitement to be in this new role working alongside Harvey and the entire Carlyle team to drive shareholder value. We are excited about the opportunities for continued growth and improved operational performance. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question will come from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Harvey, maybe we can zone in on some of the key priorities that you mentioned in your prepared remarks really starting, I guess, for the last one you highlighted around the expense structure and FRE margins. Could you just honing in a little bit more in terms of what that means. You obviously came into the business with a fresh pair buys. So curious how that could impact compensation mix and ultimately the FRE margins longer term for the firm?\nHarvey Schwartz: When you said it would impact which mix. Thanks for the question, Alex. Good to hear your voice. So this is a critical work stream. We kind of gave you a flavor of the 5. There were more than those, obviously. But as I said, let the seat, Curt and I kicked off a work stream that was really focused on margin and how we want to think about that. And obviously, he's in the process of handing up a ton over to John. We can talk about both the top line growth but you narrowed in more on the compensation piece in the expense piece. So we're basically doing a line-by-line review going through the business and making sure we're super disciplined about expense. Now as it relates to compensation, that's obviously a critical component of it. And the way we're approaching that is as you heard me say before, very first principle based. And what I mean by that is we're going to start with the things that are most critical around compensation. And that, as you know, is making sure that we have really, really as perfect as we can align it with our constituencies, our LPs, our employees and our shareholders. And at this stage, I think we're making good progress on the work stream I think there's a real opportunity here. And importantly, as it relates to our team, we want to make sure that they're aligned with the LPs that we retain and attract the best people and we really want to reward people for performance. But as a first principle, I would just say we're taking a white sheet of paper to this and we're being very thoughtful about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKenneth Worthington: John, maybe just starting high level, can you give us some background on your time at Carlyle and your decision to transition to the CFO role? And then maybe following up on Alex's question, sort of FRE margins dipped in the quarter. Can you talk us through the outlook for margins in this context of challenging market backdrop, number of fund launches but increased investment and basically, how do you see the direction of fee margins evolving as we go into the back half of the year?\nJohn Redett: Thank you, Ken and I look forward to meeting you at some point in the near future. Just quickly on the first part of your question and on my background, I've spent my entire career in financial services. The last 16 years in private equity at Carlyle. While at Carlyle, I focused on investing in financial services globally. A large component of that job, Ken, was the value creation at the portfolio company level. And I would just add, the financial services team has a great track record at Carlyle. And when the CFO opportunity was presented to me, honestly, it was the easiest carrier decision I've ever made. It was an easy yes. I'm super excited to be in this role starting October 1. And I really look forward to working with Harvey and the team to further drive shareholder value. In terms of your second part of your question, the FRE margin, I would just say, look, we know we can do better. And as Harvey mentioned, we're very focused on expenses and margin. And more importantly, we're very focused on delivering disciplined revenue growth. And I would just say, as we make progress on these work streams, we'll keep you updated in the coming periods.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: So Harvey, you've been in your seat a couple of quarters now I know you continue to analyze the business. And I'm assuming it might take some more time for you to frame out the longer-term trajectory of the firm but do you have any early expectations on what you think the underlying growth at Carlyle could look like over time based on everything you've seen thus far? And then just based on some of the growth initiatives that are underway.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes, great question. So I think I'm coming up on 6 months. And I think I've seen almost 150 LPs, I traveled to 40 days. I've met with teams internally and I could not feel better sitting here today than I ever would have imagined about the future of Carlyle and the growth opportunity. And I say that, feeling quite informed on a number of levels, the power of the brands and the dialogue with LPs directly, obviously, part of my view on this and how I feel is informed by what I think is the trajectory for the industry which I think is fantastic. It may not be fantastic quarter-to-quarter but I think the long-term trajectory of the industry is quite good. And when I think -- when I tried to give you some flavor of how we're now turning our focus to these work streams. And the work streams allow us to do a number of things they obviously allow us to prioritize growth, whether it's in insurance, it's in capital markets, some credit various parts of our business is but also it allows us to focus on margin and how we want to think about the composition of compensation and things I've already talked about. Another thing that it serves is it really brings the team together. And I feel great about the way the team is coming together in terms of the focus and this is engagement across including, obviously, John, Curt and myself and the team that you know better also, this includes some of the best investors in the world which I've brought together on various work streams. And so I feel great about the momentum. This is not going to be an immediate third, fourth quarter thing. But if you ask me about the long-term trajectory, I felt really excited when I got here in February and I feel better now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.\nJohn Redett: Chris, we can't hear.\nOperator: Chris, your may be muted. Question comes from the line of Dan Butch [ph] with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: I wanted to ask about your fundraising expectations, particularly in the private equity side. I know in your prepared remarks, you indicated that the pace of investment is slowing. The fundraising is slowing in general. But as broader markets are kind of recovering, maybe the denominator effect issues are sort of getting resolved a little bit. Any -- and as you're sort of seeing some kind of green shoots for overall transacting activity, any kind of increased optimism or updated expectations for sort of the next vintage of private equity funds taking Asia buyout Europe, Japan, the ones that are kind of expected to come later this year and into '24?\nHarvey Schwartz: So broadly speaking on fundraising, as we said, we feel this year is going to be better than last year. That's broadly across the diversified platform, right? So solutions, there's a lot of momentum there's a lot of momentum in credit. There's a lot of momentum across the insurance complex. So we feel good about that. There's a lot of momentum in real estate. Private equity, still some headwinds globally when you go around the world but we feel optimistic about certain aspects of the fundraising that are in the market right now. I can't obviously get into specifics because they're in the market right now. But I would say our comments that you heard in the prepared remarks, generally how we feel about it for the balance of the year but a lot of momentum in those other areas.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So you gave a bunch of comments that talk second half versus first half. And it was very clear that weighted towards fourth quarter given that we're in the third quarter and it's kind of slow right now. So I wonder if you can help dimensionalize how much weighted fourth quarter versus third quarter on some of those items. And then when thinking about growth. You talked optimistic about credit insurance but I was wondering if we could get a little bit more the CLOs are in the process of recovering, not good but what else is going to drive growth because there is the opposite of a private credit backdrop feels pretty good. So maybe if you can talk a little bit more on insurance and direct lending.\nHarvey Schwartz: Sure. So I mentioned in the work streams we mobilized an effort around insurance. Obviously, we have Fortitude, it's a hugely valuable asset and our ownership there. And so we mobilize work streams around that in some respects in exactly the way you talked about, Glenn, because the adjacencies between insurance origination where the pipeline is very, very good. For further transactions and the desire to work with Fortitude is a natural creator of flow into our credit business. Again, this is not a third or a fourth quarter event. This is longer term, I can tell you about the momentum we see and the pipeline that we see. Also, as it relates to our credit franchise, the performance has been good. A little slower than we expected but it feels good in terms of the pipeline of fundraising and the team feels confident for the back half of the year. So I feel good about the trajectory of all those pieces. And of course, there's adjacencies in there with capital markets in terms of how we distribute and how we bring all that together. That is really the purpose of bringing these work teams together. It's just about mobilizing the teams around these opportunities. So I would say we feel good about that. I can't pin it down to third quarter, fourth quarter and we don't really run the company that [indiscernible], as you know. It's certainly not the way I think about things. But I feel very, very confident about the trajectory and our focus on FRE margin and the things we talked about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe just back on the FRE margin and trajectory. And really, next think about next year, not the second half. But if we could put aside insurance solutions, you've talked Harvey about building up the capital markets effort. It sounds like you have the raw ingredients there to do that right now. So I'm assuming that, that can be leveraged quite well. But as we move into next year, do you view that FRE margin expansion is more of an element of revenue growth and scaling the business or more coming from expense initiatives? And you mentioned compensation is, would that be including any kind of change in structure and compensation and more comp out of FRE and into performance-based revenue.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks. Let me unpack that a little bit. So I just want to make sure I hit your points. So on FRE margin, that is, as I said, that's a critical work stream for us. And what does that mean? That means driving growth for the top line but it also means being exceptionally disciplined in terms of expenses and how we're thinking about capital deployment. And as I said, we started this process that occurred now we're transitioning that over to John. I feel very good about the momentum of that given how long I've been here and how focused the team is. And so the trajectory there would be good. And with respect to compensation, again, we want to make sure we get this perfectly right for our teams and the alignment for our constituencies but yes, compensation and the composition of compensation and making sure we reward our best people and again, at the same time, aligning with our constituencies and our LPs. Yes, that\u2019s 100% that's on the table. Too early to give you details on that as soon as we have them, we'll share them. But that's a process and we're going to be very methodical. But I can tell you as it relates to FRE margin, both growth and also expense management, we're laser-focused. And you should hear it no differently. Now you had a question inside there where you talked about capital markets which I just want to drop into for a second. And I don't want to minimize it and not rocket science, okay? We're not building space channels over here for capital markets. Basically, what we're doing is mobilizing the team to work in the adjacencies a little bit differently. We're not going to build up a big team. We don't want to be competing with the JPMorgan\u2019s of the world but we do think there's a real valuable opportunity set here where we can provide incremental revenues without any significant need to scale.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: If we look out the next couple of years, it seems like you guys are set to generate cash flow across the business. Just curious how you're thinking about deploying that cash generation, what portion might be return to shareholders versus what portion might you retain for organic growth versus inorganic? And how important or meaningful could inorganic opportunities be at this point?\nHarvey Schwartz: So for me, it's a math question. I don't want to oversimplify it. I think it's a question of really just thinking through the strategic opportunities that may be presented us versus returning the capital, as we talked about before, right now, I think the opportunities to return capital to shareholders may be more attractive but that's a moment in time. I think that when you look at the position of the firm and the footings of the firm in terms of what we have, we have an insurance investment which is quite critical to the firm. So we don't need to go out and acquire one. We have a credit business which is continuing to build organically. We have the solutions business. So all the component pieces are here. I wouldn't rule out certainly strategic partnerships where we think they could accelerate growth but they'd have to be a really good fit. And again, I know this is always the case. Everybody says the math just has to make sense. But we'll make those choices at the margin when presented. But the brand is very powerful. And if there's opportunities for us to scale in ways that are inorganic, we'll certainly consider them. But right now, I would say that's not front and center but I wouldn't rule it out over the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: Maybe coming back to the private wealth opportunity and I'm curious to get your thoughts around what the call oil product set in the wealth channel might look like 2 or 3 years from now and not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes. So this is where we feel like the brand is a very, very powerful differentiator. The name recognition, the presence of the founders and what they represent for the firm and David Rubenstein and sort of those just -- it's iconic and everybody in the world knows it. Again, we're at the beginning of this journey. I actually would say, my opinion, the industry is at the beginning of this journey. I think product development will continue to improve. I think there'll be a real innovation in the product over the next couple of years. And I think as at the team at Carlyle, we're going to be very thoughtful about this. We only have 3 products in the market right now. But this is a place where -- we want to make sure we have our market share and so we're going to be focused on it. But if it's early in the journey.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick [ph] from Autonomous Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: There were full of chunky realizations that helped the 2Q performance fee but how are you thinking about realizations in the second half now relative to your tone on the first quarter call? And is there a tangible pipeline you can speak to or tangible pipeline building you can speak to now?\nHarvey Schwartz: We wouldn't want to have this call without Curt ever opening his mouth. So it looks like you want to actually speak, Patrick, we're going to let Curt take a question. I think that the poor guys just don't have one question on this call.\nCurtis Buser: Appreciate the question. And before I answer, let me just say thank you -- thank you really to all of our shareholders. I want to say thank you to our founders. And I want to say thank you to really all the analysts that follow us. It's been great working with you. Over this time. It's really been an honor and privilege for me to serve in this role. And I have total confidence in Harvey and John's leadership, taking it forward. And look, we've got a great team at Carlyle, big bench lots of tenure on the team. It's just really been a great honor. In terms of realizations, Look, we got $3.7 billion of net accrued carry, roughly $10 a share, just as John said, we delivered $1.5 billion of net carry realizations in 2021 and 2022, it was roughly $1 billion. First half this year, $245 million. Look, it's really hard, as I've said in the past, I call it, to the nickel on which deal is going to close in and how all that plays out. I would kind of think second half of the year in pole is going to look more or less like the first half of the year on carry. But it's -- look, I'd say gas and things can slide and until activity really picks up again, it's a hard thing to really nail down. But again, $3.7 billion a lot of carry and we're very excited about that to be able to turn that into cash.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes, I view that as -- and just a war chest at $10 a share. It's incredible.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: My question is on the capital markets business. I know you're looking to grow this business. And at the 2021 Investor Day, Carlyle provided a transaction fee target of greater than $120 million by 2024. So I'm just curious if this target is still valid as we think about updating our models.\nHarvey Schwartz: So I wasn't here in 2021, so I can't speak to that. But we haven't set targets. I can give you a little insight into how we've been focused as a team and maybe this is more of an insight than you want but we're systematically working on the -- with the work stream that we mobilize, we're systematically working business by business, to ensure that we have the right connectivity, the right plan literally across every pocket of the firm in terms of how we want to drive value here. And I think that as a business, I think it's a difficult business to predict. It's going to have an episodic nature to it because it's going to be sensitive to market activity. And we're not looking to be a giant capital committer here. So this is really about us moving the ball from being very small at $15 million to marginally growing. But we'll come back to you at a later date. But I would personally be reluctant to put hard targets out there but I can give you some sense of scope when we look backwards and opportunities in the way that we approach them versus the way we would now, the opportunity looks meaningful. And I feel good about it.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Harvey. And Curtis [indiscernible] with you. Best of luck with your next venture.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks, Greg. Really appreciate it and it's been fun.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Adam [ph] with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Following up around realizations, I don't know if Curt gets a twofer out of this but there's been press during the quarter and more recently around a potential monetization of a significant holding in China. And obviously, I don't expect you to comment on a specific deal. But I just wanted to broaden that out because the other part of the press piece was that the asset might be included in a continuation vehicle. So I wanted to broaden that out and just ask about the potential use of continuation vehicles at Carlyle given the amount of mature assets that you have in different portfolios and the potential benefits of that for the firm? And also maybe a comment on the deal backdrop in China.\nCurtis Buser: Thanks for the question. Let me make a few comments here. So first, we focus on our business operations across Asia. We've got a great track record there and the team does just a phenomenal job really operating across Asia. China, India and many of the countries in that arena. And so feel really good about the team and what they've accomplished and what they continue to do. I'm hesitant to talk about any specific deal because things aren't done. Continuation funds are tools that we look at, there's complexities with continuation funds, as you're all aware and so it's not something that we routinely do. We spend a lot of time thinking it through and examining all of the potential conflicts around that. But really, it's premature to comment on anything specifically on this. And I would say that those things also take some time to kind of pull together. So comments I made before in terms of the second half are still the right way to think about it for your near-term modeling.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I have a follow-up with Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was just hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit on the deployment pipeline and the potential for new deal activity. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're seeing that backdrop evolving? How are terms and structures adjusting? And given the improvement in equity markets and reduction in volatility, what seems like peak Fed funds here, I guess what are the key hurdles do you see at this point for deals getting announced and getting completed?\nHarvey Schwartz: I'll give you my perspective on that. I would say that from the deal team perspective and the flows we're seeing and I would say there's been a marked improved improvement in sentiment. And I think we can be more optimistic about activity going forward. But I'd say the market still feels fragile. CEO confidence is improving. But we've had a major shift, obviously, in the cost of capital which I talked about. And I think across the marketplace, that's still being digested. Of course, this will be worked through. But that would give you that perspective at a high level but we're seeing some interesting opportunities. Our teams are being very selective in deploying capital. John, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?\nJohn Redett: Yes. Look, I think it comes down to confidence. And I think you're starting to see the level of confidence increase among executives. And I think that's a positive thing. I do think we're still absorbing the high rate environment we're in. I think that caught a lot of people off guard. Thankfully, we've hedged most of our capital structures. So look, I think you're going to start to see more activity, looking at our pipelines across the platform. Our pipeline logs are looking a little better but I think it's going to take time.\nMichael Cyprys: Any particular areas where you might expect activity to return first versus what may take a little bit longer and what may not come back?\nHarvey Schwartz: I would say, I think you're going to see activity come back in private equity in credit pretty much at the same time. I don't think one is necessarily ahead or behind the other.\nOperator: I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Daniel Harris for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, operator and thank you all for your time this morning and, of course, your interest in Carlyle. If you have any questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations after the call. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm excited to be joined today by John Redett who you'll hear from later as well as Curt. There are 2 areas I'd like to cover. First, the for macro environment; and second, a review of several work streams that will position us to drive long-term growth. First, the macro environment. As I've said previously, we're in one of the most complex periods in recent economic history. The combination of sustained elevated inflation along with central bank rate hikes has led to a corresponding increase in the cost of capital. The peak of the inflationary cycle may have passed but our base case is that rates stay higher for longer as we shift away from a decade of 0 interest rate policy. It remains early days in understanding the impact of this shift on corporate capital structures and liquidity. Among other factors, this shift in interest rates further contributes to mixed investor appetite and sentiment. In part, our economic and market views are informed by the vast data and proprietary insights gathered from our portfolio. The data set includes nearly 300 global companies, 600 real estate investments. And loans to over 1,300 issuers. Let's start with inflation. We're starting to see it's more difficult for our portfolio companies to pass through increased cost, reinforcing the view that the inflationary cycle has peaked. Our portfolio company CEOs remain generally cautious in terms of how they're approaching the operating environment but broadly, our portfolios have seen accelerating activity with over 10% EBITDA growth. As you'd expect, these economic forces have slowed the pace of investment across the industry. You see this in the amount of capital we are deploying and you see it in lower fundraising LPs slow decision-making on new fund allocations. Having said that, in general, our teams are seeing signs of an increasing pace of early deal flow access across most asset classes. Now I want to update you on 5 key areas that we are focused on as a leadership team. Though these are just a sample of activities around the firm. We have mobilized teams and launched work streams for each of these. As you'd expect we are approaching these in a very deliberate and methodical manner. And while early, let me give you a line of sight into what we're doing. First, our Insurance Solutions business. Our relationship with Fortitude is profitable, strategic and vital but only one piece in the opportunity set. As insurance companies look to free up capital and shift liabilities to improve their ROE, we're seeing a greater interest on their part to partner with us in a variety of important ways. Second, our capital markets team. They also have a large opportunity to scale their impact. We have in place today all the key ingredients for growth, a well-positioned and active private equity franchise and an experienced capital markets team. As activity rates pick up, we expect that we will further leverage our deal flow and our portfolio companies need for capital to create a natural tailwind in this business. Third we're also focused on our technology and our AI strategy. This allows us to create operational efficiencies across the firm as well as at our portfolio companies and is an important driver of growth and scale over the long term. We recently appointed the CS Juarez as our new Chief Information Officer and Head of Technology Transformation. She will work closely with the entire leadership team to drive technology transformation strategy and operations. Now fourth, as we said before, we see long-term opportunity around private wealth. We've recently hired a new Head of Private Wealth strategy. While we only have 3 products in the market covering 5 billion of assets today, we view this as an important channel for growth. We'll be working with our distribution partners to bring product innovation globally to the Wealth Cal. Most importantly, the Carlyle brand is a huge differentiator here. And fifth, the last work stream I'll mention is around expense management and improving FRE margin. This means investing in our platform wisely to drive top line growth, as well as closely monitoring the overall level and composition of expense as well as the capital required to run the firm. This is a critical strategic effort. We will continue to move with a disciplined sense of urgency around each one of these and we'll continue to update you as these progress. To close, as I said, we're still operating within a somewhat challenging market backdrop. It's important to state that we will be patient when we need to be, while at the same time, capitalizing on opportunities to deploy capital where we see attractive risk reward. As a leadership team, we are intensely focused on delivering performance excellence for our investors and driving long-term shareholder value. We are taking action to mobilize teams around priority areas to drive disciplined growth. and I'm really enthusiastic for Carlisle's future. Now before I hand it to John, I'd also like to take a moment to thank Curt for his tremendous contributions to Carlyle over the last nearly 20 years. I personally am thankful for Curt's counsel and support as I transitioned into Carlyle over the past 6 months and I've really enjoyed getting it on. I know you'll all join me in wishing him the best in his upcoming retirement. And now, John, over to you. When you said it would impact which mix. Thanks for the question, Alex. Good to hear your voice. So this is a critical work stream. We kind of gave you a flavor of the 5. There were more than those, obviously. But as I said, let the seat, Curt and I kicked off a work stream that was really focused on margin and how we want to think about that. And obviously, he's in the process of handing up a ton over to John. We can talk about both the top line growth but you narrowed in more on the compensation piece in the expense piece. So we're basically doing a line-by-line review going through the business and making sure we're super disciplined about expense. Now as it relates to compensation, that's obviously a critical component of it. And the way we're approaching that is as you heard me say before, very first principle based. And what I mean by that is we're going to start with the things that are most critical around compensation. And that, as you know, is making sure that we have really, really as perfect as we can align it with our constituencies, our LPs, our employees and our shareholders. And at this stage, I think we're making good progress on the work stream I think there's a real opportunity here. And importantly, as it relates to our team, we want to make sure that they're aligned with the LPs that we retain and attract the best people and we really want to reward people for performance. But as a first principle, I would just say we're taking a white sheet of paper to this and we're being very thoughtful about it. Yes, great question. So I think I'm coming up on 6 months. And I think I've seen almost 150 LPs, I traveled to 40 days. I've met with teams internally and I could not feel better sitting here today than I ever would have imagined about the future of Carlyle and the growth opportunity. And I say that, feeling quite informed on a number of levels, the power of the brands and the dialogue with LPs directly, obviously, part of my view on this and how I feel is informed by what I think is the trajectory for the industry which I think is fantastic. It may not be fantastic quarter-to-quarter but I think the long-term trajectory of the industry is quite good. And when I think -- when I tried to give you some flavor of how we're now turning our focus to these work streams. And the work streams allow us to do a number of things they obviously allow us to prioritize growth, whether it's in insurance, it's in capital markets, some credit various parts of our business is but also it allows us to focus on margin and how we want to think about the composition of compensation and things I've already talked about. Another thing that it serves is it really brings the team together. And I feel great about the way the team is coming together in terms of the focus and this is engagement across including, obviously, John, Curt and myself and the team that you know better also, this includes some of the best investors in the world which I've brought together on various work streams. And so I feel great about the momentum. This is not going to be an immediate third, fourth quarter thing. But if you ask me about the long-term trajectory, I felt really excited when I got here in February and I feel better now. So broadly speaking on fundraising, as we said, we feel this year is going to be better than last year. That's broadly across the diversified platform, right? So solutions, there's a lot of momentum there's a lot of momentum in credit. There's a lot of momentum across the insurance complex. So we feel good about that. There's a lot of momentum in real estate. Private equity, still some headwinds globally when you go around the world but we feel optimistic about certain aspects of the fundraising that are in the market right now. I can't obviously get into specifics because they're in the market right now. But I would say our comments that you heard in the prepared remarks, generally how we feel about it for the balance of the year but a lot of momentum in those other areas. Sure. So I mentioned in the work streams we mobilized an effort around insurance. Obviously, we have Fortitude, it's a hugely valuable asset and our ownership there. And so we mobilize work streams around that in some respects in exactly the way you talked about, Glenn, because the adjacencies between insurance origination where the pipeline is very, very good. For further transactions and the desire to work with Fortitude is a natural creator of flow into our credit business. Again, this is not a third or a fourth quarter event. This is longer term, I can tell you about the momentum we see and the pipeline that we see. Also, as it relates to our credit franchise, the performance has been good. A little slower than we expected but it feels good in terms of the pipeline of fundraising and the team feels confident for the back half of the year. So I feel good about the trajectory of all those pieces. And of course, there's adjacencies in there with capital markets in terms of how we distribute and how we bring all that together. That is really the purpose of bringing these work teams together. It's just about mobilizing the teams around these opportunities. So I would say we feel good about that. I can't pin it down to third quarter, fourth quarter and we don't really run the company that [indiscernible], as you know. It's certainly not the way I think about things. But I feel very, very confident about the trajectory and our focus on FRE margin and the things we talked about. Thanks. Let me unpack that a little bit. So I just want to make sure I hit your points. So on FRE margin, that is, as I said, that's a critical work stream for us. And what does that mean? That means driving growth for the top line but it also means being exceptionally disciplined in terms of expenses and how we're thinking about capital deployment. And as I said, we started this process that occurred now we're transitioning that over to John. I feel very good about the momentum of that given how long I've been here and how focused the team is. And so the trajectory there would be good. And with respect to compensation, again, we want to make sure we get this perfectly right for our teams and the alignment for our constituencies but yes, compensation and the composition of compensation and making sure we reward our best people and again, at the same time, aligning with our constituencies and our LPs. Yes, that's 100% that's on the table. Too early to give you details on that as soon as we have them, we'll share them. But that's a process and we're going to be very methodical. But I can tell you as it relates to FRE margin, both growth and also expense management, we're laser-focused. And you should hear it no differently. Now you had a question inside there where you talked about capital markets which I just want to drop into for a second. And I don't want to minimize it and not rocket science, okay? We're not building space channels over here for capital markets. Basically, what we're doing is mobilizing the team to work in the adjacencies a little bit differently. We're not going to build up a big team. We don't want to be competing with the JPMorgan's of the world but we do think there's a real valuable opportunity set here where we can provide incremental revenues without any significant need to scale. So for me, it's a math question. I don't want to oversimplify it. I think it's a question of really just thinking through the strategic opportunities that may be presented us versus returning the capital, as we talked about before, right now, I think the opportunities to return capital to shareholders may be more attractive but that's a moment in time. I think that when you look at the position of the firm and the footings of the firm in terms of what we have, we have an insurance investment which is quite critical to the firm. So we don't need to go out and acquire one. We have a credit business which is continuing to build organically. We have the solutions business. So all the component pieces are here. I wouldn't rule out certainly strategic partnerships where we think they could accelerate growth but they'd have to be a really good fit. And again, I know this is always the case. Everybody says the math just has to make sense. But we'll make those choices at the margin when presented. But the brand is very powerful. And if there's opportunities for us to scale in ways that are inorganic, we'll certainly consider them. But right now, I would say that's not front and center but I wouldn't rule it out over the long term. Yes. So this is where we feel like the brand is a very, very powerful differentiator. The name recognition, the presence of the founders and what they represent for the firm and David Rubenstein and sort of those just -- it's iconic and everybody in the world knows it. Again, we're at the beginning of this journey. I actually would say, my opinion, the industry is at the beginning of this journey. I think product development will continue to improve. I think there'll be a real innovation in the product over the next couple of years. And I think as at the team at Carlyle, we're going to be very thoughtful about this. We only have 3 products in the market right now. But this is a place where -- we want to make sure we have our market share and so we're going to be focused on it. But if it's early in the journey. We wouldn't want to have this call without Curt ever opening his mouth. So it looks like you want to actually speak, Patrick, we're going to let Curt take a question. I think that the poor guys just don't have one question on this call. Yes, I view that as -- and just a war chest at $10 a share. It's incredible. So I wasn't here in 2021, so I can't speak to that. But we haven't set targets. I can give you a little insight into how we've been focused as a team and maybe this is more of an insight than you want but we're systematically working on the -- with the work stream that we mobilize, we're systematically working business by business, to ensure that we have the right connectivity, the right plan literally across every pocket of the firm in terms of how we want to drive value here. And I think that as a business, I think it's a difficult business to predict. It's going to have an episodic nature to it because it's going to be sensitive to market activity. And we're not looking to be a giant capital committer here. So this is really about us moving the ball from being very small at $15 million to marginally growing. But we'll come back to you at a later date. But I would personally be reluctant to put hard targets out there but I can give you some sense of scope when we look backwards and opportunities in the way that we approach them versus the way we would now, the opportunity looks meaningful. And I feel good about it. I'll give you my perspective on that. I would say that from the deal team perspective and the flows we're seeing and I would say there's been a marked improved improvement in sentiment. And I think we can be more optimistic about activity going forward. But I'd say the market still feels fragile. CEO confidence is improving. But we've had a major shift, obviously, in the cost of capital which I talked about. And I think across the marketplace, that's still being digested. Of course, this will be worked through. But that would give you that perspective at a high level but we're seeing some interesting opportunities. Our teams are being very selective in deploying capital. John, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? I would say, I think you're going to see activity come back in private equity in credit pretty much at the same time. I don't think one is necessarily ahead or behind the other."

            "content": "Appreciate the question. And before I answer, let me just say thank you -- thank you really to all of our shareholders. I want to say thank you to our founders. And I want to say thank you to really all the analysts that follow us. It's been great working with you. Over this time. It's really been an honor and privilege for me to serve in this role. And I have total confidence in Harvey and John's leadership, taking it forward. And look, we've got a great team at Carlyle, big bench lots of tenure on the team. It's just really been a great honor. In terms of realizations, Look, we got $3.7 billion of net accrued carry, roughly $10 a share, just as John said, we delivered $1.5 billion of net carry realizations in 2021 and 2022, it was roughly $1 billion. First half this year, $245 million. Look, it's really hard, as I've said in the past, I call it, to the nickel on which deal is going to close in and how all that plays out. I would kind of think second half of the year in pole is going to look more or less like the first half of the year on carry. But it's -- look, I'd say gas and things can slide and until activity really picks up again, it's a hard thing to really nail down. But again, $3.7 billion a lot of carry and we're very excited about that to be able to turn that into cash. Thanks, Greg. Really appreciate it and it's been fun. Thanks for the question. Let me make a few comments here. So first, we focus on our business operations across Asia. We've got a great track record there and the team does just a phenomenal job really operating across Asia. China, India and many of the countries in that arena. And so feel really good about the team and what they've accomplished and what they continue to do. I'm hesitant to talk about any specific deal because things aren't done. Continuation funds are tools that we look at, there's complexities with continuation funds, as you're all aware and so it's not something that we routinely do. We spend a lot of time thinking it through and examining all of the potential conflicts around that. But really, it's premature to comment on anything specifically on this. And I would say that those things also take some time to kind of pull together. So comments I made before in terms of the second half are still the right way to think about it for your near-term modeling."

            "content": "Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. I also want to thank Curt for his 20 years of leadership at Carlyle and for the guidance he continues to provide me as I transition into the CFO role. I look forward to working more closely with many of you in the coming periods. As Harvey highlighted, we delivered solid results this quarter in a tough environment, driven by a diversified investment platform and the focus of our global investment teams. We produced $389 million in distributable earnings for the second quarter or $0.88 in DE per share. Year-to-date, we have generated $660 million of DE or $1.51 in DE per share. We reached a $60 million of shares in the second quarter and have repurchased $160 million in the first half of the year. Today, I'm going to focus my remarks on 3 main areas: fee-related earnings in the near-term outlook, accrued carry and fundraising. First, fee-related earnings. Increased to $207 million in the quarter, up from $193 million in Q1 2023. Relative to the second quarter last year, FRE declined 12% as modest growth in revenue was offset by continued investment into our people and teams. Year-to-date, FRE of $401 million was down 5% compared to the same period last year. Second quarter management fees of $515 million increased sequentially after having declined for a few quarters with increases in each of our segments. Over the next few quarters, new fund launches and fee activations should support continued management fee growth. Our second quarter results benefited from $73 million in fee-related performance revenue. Looking ahead, we are not expecting to generate material fee-related performance revenue in global private equity in the second half of 2023, though global credit fee-related performance revenue should remain stable. Transaction and advisory fees were $18 million in the quarter, down significantly from a year ago, given muted capital markets activity which has pressured both FRE and the margins. And as you heard from Harvey, driving an increasing level of transaction revenue from our investment platforms is a major focus area for the firm. Compensation expense was $289 million in the second quarter an 11% increase year-over-year. A majority of the increase this quarter was a function of higher fee-related performance revenue as we generally accrue compensation at 45% of associated revenue. Excluding this impact, compensation expense increased only 5% year-over-year. G&A expense of $102 million reflects a more normalized set of firm-wide activities relative to lower levels we saw during the pandemic. This quarter also included external fundraising costs largely captured in global investment solutions which supported fundraising momentum. G&A expense may tick up in the back half of the year as we typically have increased operating costs tied to our LP conferences. With regards to our FRE outlook, second half 2023 FRE is likely to be similar in the aggregate to the first half of 2023 with a relatively stronger fourth quarter. We remain focused on generating sustainable top line revenue growth as well as diversifying and growing FRE. Moving on, I'd like to discuss our net accrued carry. Our global carry fund portfolio appreciated 2% in the quarter with relative strength in infrastructure and natural resources, owing to an uptick in announced transactions. We had more muted appreciation in private equity and real estate. Our net accrued carry balance of $3.7 billion declined from $4 billion last quarter. Most of this decline was driven by $175 million in net realizations with the balance due to a reduction in accrued carry in global private equity. Even with this decline, the net accrual remains at a robust $10 per share which is a substantial source of future shareholder value. Let me finish up with an update on fundraising. Fund investors continue to face challenging decisions and make commitments more slowly than in previous years. Despite this slowdown, we still expect to raise a larger amount of capital in 2023 than we did in 2022. Through the first half of 2023, we raised $14 billion of new capital. Approximately halfway to last year's fundraising total. We have momentum in several important strategies that should see inflows in the second half of 2023, likely weighted towards the fourth quarter. In Global Investment Solutions, we are off to a good start for our latest vintage secondaries and co-investment strategies which should both continue into the second half of the year and into 2024. This new capital will turn on management fees later this year. In Global Credit, we expect to grow off a slower start to 2023. We've priced 2 CLOs in the second quarter after none in the first quarter. Our credit opportunities fund should continue to attract more capital and a number of strategies in SMAs are positioned to generate positive flows, with the fourth quarter likely to be relatively stronger than the third quarter. In Global Private equity, we expect to raise capital in the second half of the year in several buyout funds and various real asset strategies. Wrapping up, let me reiterate my excitement to be in this new role working alongside Harvey and the entire Carlyle team to drive shareholder value. We are excited about the opportunities for continued growth and improved operational performance. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Thank you, Ken and I look forward to meeting you at some point in the near future. Just quickly on the first part of your question and on my background, I've spent my entire career in financial services. The last 16 years in private equity at Carlyle. While at Carlyle, I focused on investing in financial services globally. A large component of that job, Ken, was the value creation at the portfolio company level. And I would just add, the financial services team has a great track record at Carlyle. And when the CFO opportunity was presented to me, honestly, it was the easiest carrier decision I've ever made. It was an easy yes. I'm super excited to be in this role starting October 1. And I really look forward to working with Harvey and the team to further drive shareholder value. In terms of your second part of your question, the FRE margin, I would just say, look, we know we can do better. And as Harvey mentioned, we're very focused on expenses and margin. And more importantly, we're very focused on delivering disciplined revenue growth. And I would just say, as we make progress on these work streams, we'll keep you updated in the coming periods. Chris, we can't hear. Yes. Look, I think it comes down to confidence. And I think you're starting to see the level of confidence increase among executives. And I think that's a positive thing. I do think we're still absorbing the high rate environment we're in. I think that caught a lot of people off guard. Thankfully, we've hedged most of our capital structures. So look, I think you're going to start to see more activity, looking at our pipelines across the platform. Our pipeline logs are looking a little better but I think it's going to take time."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star-one-one on your telephone.  I would now like to hand the call over to Head of Public Investor Relations, Daniel Harris. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you Latif. Good morning and welcome to Carlyle\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz, and our Chief Financial Officer, Curt Buser. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation which is also available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release to the extent reasonably available. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. I\u2019m going to begin with a quick discussion of our results and then hand the call over to Harvey. For the first quarter, we generated $193 million in fee-related earnings and $272 million in distributable earnings, with DE per common share of $0.63. We raised $6.8 billion of new capital and deployed $3.8 billion in capital across our carry funds. Our accrued carry balance remains at a robust $4 billion. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share. We know it\u2019s a busy morning, and as we already have a long queue, please limit yourself to one question and move back into the queue for any additional follow-ups. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Dan. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. It\u2019s great to be here with all of you. Some of you I\u2019ve worked with in the past, and others, it will be great to meet you soon. There are three things I plan to review today: our first quarter performance, the macro environment and our general outlook, and lastly I\u2019ll end with some initial thoughts on my first 80 days here at Carlyle. First with regards to our performance, let me be clear - we\u2019re not pleased with our first quarter results. Curt will walk you through the details, but our activity levels and investments, realizations and fundraising were more muted than our prior expectations. We continue to navigate one of the most complex financial markets in recent memory which is clouding the near term outlook and impacting market sentiment. It\u2019s our expectation these effects will last throughout the remainder of the year and impact both FRE and distributable earnings. That said, importantly we are confident that Carlyle is well positioned for when market stabilized and activity levels ultimately pick up. We don\u2019t invest and we don\u2019t run the firm quarter to quarter. The firm has a long history of successfully investing through all cycles. We have a leading private equity business with a long term track record, a fast growing global credit business and a higher performing investment solutions business. We have $381 billion of assets under management and $73 billion in capital available to deploy across strategies and geographies, and we have longstanding, very deep relationships with the largest and most sophisticated global investors. There is substantial and very attractive white space for Carlyle to continue to grow our platform which alongside a disciplined approach to running the firm will ultimately expand margins, expand FRE, and grow distributable earnings. Shifting now to the macro environment, for the past 30 to 40 years, there were several mega trends at play. These mega trends underpinned economic activity. A long term down trend in interest rates supporting an upward trend in equity markets and asset prices broadly, markets benefiting from historically low inflation, and increased globalization and technological innovation allowed global economies to thrive. Today for the first time in many investors\u2019 lifetimes, some of those trends are slowing or even reversing. The cost of capital has gone up. Discount rates and cap rates have increased and are pressuring valuations, as well as expected returns. Of course, this shift in trends will take time to work through global markets and asset prices. Adding even more complexity, while the banking system in the U.S. and abroad generally have healthy balance sheets from years of capital building, they are now tightening underwriting standards and regional banks, following recent stress, are likely to face increased regulation and capital requirements. In my experience, this will almost certainly lead to a further tightening of lending standards, dampening the pace of economic activity. While companies are not raising capital at the same frequency as prior years, their core needs haven\u2019t changed. They need capital to grow and capital to refinance liabilities. This is where our global credit business is taking share from traditional lenders, and just this week you will have seen Fortitude announce a major reinsurance transaction that will accelerate the growth of their business. For our LPs who require help managing their portfolios in this complex environment, our global investment solutions business is well positioned to meet this demand and continue to grow the platform. The important point to remember is that Carlyle has operated through significant market dislocations before. We remain actively engaged with sellers, buyers and capital providers around the world - we\u2019re very front-footed. We certainly don\u2019t invest for any single quarter or year. We raise capital and we invest for the long term. The opportunities across asset classes, regions and sectors are growing increasingly more attractive as markets remain volatile and uncertain. While we remain cautious on the near term environment, we also are beginning to see opportunities to put a huge amount of capital to work that will help drive long term performance and asset growth. This is an exciting time to be an investor in global private markets.  I\u2019ll close with some thoughts since I\u2019ve gotten started in my new role. I spent the past few months meeting our people and getting to know our investors around the world. Carlyle is an iconic brand, one I\u2019ve admired my entire career. We have an experienced and talented team of professionals who are up for any challenge, and that team is a big part of why I\u2019m here. Our culture is strong. It reflects the 35-year history of the firm and is made up of a group of talented, smart, hard-working, world-class professionals who care deeply about our firm, and we are committed to being a fiduciary for our clients. We are in an industry that is growing and there is massive long term potential for Carlyle. Everything starts with investment performance, and our firm was built to provide the highest level of care to our investors and to capture the significant opportunities that continue to emerge. Throughout my career, I\u2019ve been a believer in disciplined growth. As we grow, we are also working to identify areas where we can instill more discipline around our operations. This approach will deliver returns for our shareholders and fund investors alike. It\u2019s an exciting time for the industry and for Carlyle, and I\u2019m very excited to be here and be part of it. With that, I\u2019ll hand things over to Curt to provide a more detailed breakdown of the quarter.\nCurtis Buser: Thank you Harvey, and good morning everyone. I want to start with an outlook on three particular areas that complement Harvey\u2019s comments and put our financial results in context with the current macro environment. First with respect to fundraising, we continue to expect to raise more capital this year than we did last year, though the composition of that fundraising has skewed further towards global credit and investment solutions and less from corporate private equity. Over the balance of this year, we expect to see CLO issuance resume in addition to incremental fundraising for a number of credit products, as well as raising capital in our secondaries and co-investment strategies and investment solutions.  While we believe that we will attract a significant amount of capital for our next vintage of buy-out funds, we no longer expect these funds in the aggregate to be the same size as their predecessors and now expect to see a decline in buy-out fund sizes across most geographies.  Second, as you heard Harvey indicate, we expect that the slowdown in capital markets activity will result in a muted level of near term realizations, pressure on capital markets transaction fees, and lower performance-related earnings. That said, we continue to have $4 billion in net accrued carry and believe the firm\u2019s ability to monetize that carry will be strong over the next few years. Third, our 2023 [indiscernible] outlook. Given uncertainty in current market conditions, including the impact from a slower transactional environment and a lower buy-out fundraising outlook, our 2023 FRE is likely to be modestly below last year. While we expect to see top line fee growth this year, we also expect to see continued investments into our teams and businesses. We will be disciplined managing our expenses while at the same time ensuring the firm is well positioned to grow over time, notably across our global credit platform, extending the capabilities of our capital markets team and supporting continued growth at Fortitude. Now let me dig a bit deeper into the major drivers of our results. Fee-related earnings of $193 million increased 6% over the first quarter of 2022. Top line management fees of $506 million were up 11% year-over-year, with the strongest growth in our global credit platform through a combination of organic growth and the impact from strategic transactions last year. Fee earning assets under management of $271 billion increased 29% from the first quarter last year, driven by $28 billion of fundraising over that same time period alongside strategic transactions completed last year. Two days ago on May 2, Fortitude announced an agreement to reinsure $28 billion of life and fixed annuity products. This Fortitude transaction is a great example of its strategy to become a preferred solutions provider to large global insurers as it leverages its strong balance sheet and broad capabilities to pursue growth. Fortitude expects to close this transaction in mid-2023, pending customary regulatory approvals. When the transaction closes, Carlyle\u2019s fee-earnings assets under management will increase by the amount of the reinsurance transaction as part of our strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude, and over time we expect about 20% of the general account assets related to this transaction to be directly invested into Carlyle investment strategies. The impact of this transaction was included in our updated fee-related earnings outlook for the year. Fee-related performance revenue of $29 million in the first quarter was down from $45 million last year as the contribution from core plus real estate was muted in the first quarter, while global credit fee-related performance revenue was up more than 30%. Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect to benefit from a substantially higher level of fee-related performance revenue in global private equity. This is because we expect a significant step-up in the crystallizing of gains next quarter in core plus real estate, which will then moderate in the following quarters.  As we have previously noted, we expect to generate significant revenues in this line item every year, though certain quarters throughout the year will be higher than others. Also keep in mind that fee-related performance revenue\u2019s compensation expense, which is captured in our FRE compensation line, will vary directly at about 45% of revenue. FRE margin was 35% this quarter, down modestly from 36% in the first quarter of last year. While total fee revenues were up 7% compared to last year, FRE expenses increased 8%, leading to the margin compression. For the full year, we expect FRE margin to be modestly lower compared to 2022. Longer term, scaling the firm and operating effectively remains a key priority, and we expect to see FRE margins resume their upward trend in 2024. Moving on, our portfolio continues to perform well relative to choppy public markets, with overall portfolio appreciation of 2% in the first quarter across our carry funds and appreciation of 7% over the past 12 months. This is well higher relative to a 9% decline in the MSCI All-Country World Index over that same time period.  Our global credit carry fund portfolio rose 3% in the quarter and is also up 7% over the last 12 months, while our corporate private equity portfolio was up 1% in the quarter and 3% over the past year. Appreciation in our infrastructure and natural resources portfolio was flat in the quarter amidst volatile but range-bound energy prices, but this portfolio is still up 24% over the last 12 months, and appreciation in our global investment solutions funds was up 5% in the quarter and 7% over the past year. A few other quick points. Equity-based compensation expense of $57 million increased from $41 million in the first quarter last year as an elevated level of equity grants to employees and our new CEO grants in February began to impact results. We expect to see this expense tick higher in the second quarter and then remain at an elevated level. We repurchased $100 million in shares in the first quarter, and as of March 31 our board of directors reset and increased our repurchase authorization to $500 million.  Our balance sheet remains solid, over $1 billion in cash and nothing drawn against our $1 billion revolver. We have the flexibility to remain opportunistic if prospects arise to deploy our valuable capital. As we have said before, our DE effective tax rate is likely to be volatile on a quarterly basis, and this quarter it was lower than normal but we still expect it to average around 20% on an annualized basis. In sum, while there are some short term challenges, we are optimistic long term and see opportunities for growth and value creation.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Harvey, who would like to make a few closing remarks.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Curt. Before we move onto Q&A, I wanted to reiterate that while there are near term challenges, there is tremendous long term opportunity for the firm. The overall positive trends in the industry and the strength of our brand and our people - well, these are the reasons why I\u2019m here. It really is quite a privilege to be part of this team and part of this firm. Let me turn the call over to the Operator so we can take your questions. Again, great to be here with you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your question please, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi Harvey, good to talk to you again. \nHarvey Schwartz: Hey Glenn. Glenn, you\u2019re just breaking up a little bit.\nGlenn Schorr: Sorry. Good to talk to you again. I\u2019m curious - you know, it\u2019s a little bit of a unique situation, but new CEO, I heard some of your previous comments. I\u2019m curious how you\u2019d describe, maybe in laymen\u2019s terms, what are you here to do. I saw the quote in the beginning of the slide deck of continuing to expand and diversify the platform. I heard your comment about substantial and very active white space for Carlyle, so I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Thanks.\nHarvey Schwartz: Okay, well Glenn, it\u2019s good to hear your voice, even a little garbled, but nice to chat with you again. I hope you\u2019ve been well. Maybe I should back up for a second, and before I get directly to your question, maybe I should just talk a little bit about why I\u2019m here and how I got here, and that decision-making process. As I said in my remarks, I\u2019ve known about Carlyle for my entire career. It\u2019s an amazing brand. I know the power of an amazing brand. Since I met with the founders, we clicked immediately, and as I got to know the people, I knew the talent in the organization and the investing prowess, and then really when I looked at the valuation gap between our firm and other firms, it just didn\u2019t make any sense to me, and so the decision to be here actually ended up being quite easy and, as I said, really quite a privilege for me to be part of this team and part of this firm. Now I\u2019ve been here, I don\u2019t know, give or take 80 days, the team reminded me, and I sort of jokingly, or I refer to it sort of in my own Carlyle immersion course, I\u2019ve just been spending time with our LPs, spending time with the teams, getting to know everyone, and probably more importantly giving them a chance to get to know me. In terms of the white space, there\u2019s just a lot of opportunity for us. We have businesses like global credit, which have been growing very quickly. We\u2019ll continue to grow those. There\u2019s the private wealth space, real estate, one of the highest performing real estate teams, there\u2019s a lot of interest there, our solutions business. You know, when you go around the firm, there\u2019s a lot of energy to grow these businesses. Now it\u2019s early days for me, but I can tell you the enthusiasm and the energy is real.  Did we lose you, Glenn?\nGlenn Schorr: No, thanks. I thought we were limited to one question. I appreciate it Harvey, thanks.\nHarvey Schwartz: No, I just thought maybe I lost you. No, you are limited to one question, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks. Good to hear you.\nHarvey Schwartz: You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Credit Suisse. Your question please, Bill.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you. I think it\u2019s a bad connection as well.  First of all, Harvey, congratulations--\nHarvey Schwartz: We can hear you, don\u2019t worry.\nBill Katz: Very good. Congratulations and welcome.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thank you.\nBill Katz: Maybe just to build on your last set of responses to Glenn\u2019s question, can you sort of tie together, maybe as you look at some of these bigger picture opportunities, maybe the top one or two things you\u2019ll be most focused on as you look out over the next year or two, and relative to your discussion of disciplined growth, can you tie that into Curt\u2019s comments about FRE guide down on expenses and where that expense growth may focus? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: Well, the disciplined growth, that\u2019s just always the way I\u2019ve approached businesses that I\u2019ve been part of, it\u2019s the way the team here approaches things, and so that, again, I would say is more philosophically my approach but has also been the philosophy of the firm.  You know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a--how do I say this? I don\u2019t really have any favorite children, so I like growth for growth\u2019s sake. We have a lot of resources here, and so if there\u2019s demand for our solutions business, we\u2019ll respond to that; if there\u2019s demand for growing the private wealth footprint, there\u2019s a lot of people in the world that want access to Carlyle and Carlyle investing capability. Some things will take longer, some things will be more immediate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of prioritizing one or two things. I think it\u2019s a question of as a team, we mobilize against all these things but we do it quite thoughtfully. We\u2019re not going to rush. I\u2019m certainly not in a rush, and it\u2019s really going to be about excellence of execution and however long that takes. I think it\u2019s more about excellence of execution, but the opportunities are clear.\nCurtisis Buser: Harvey, why don\u2019t I take the second part of Bill\u2019s question, really, on FRE and the revised guidance. Look - we\u2019ve been focused on growing FRE. It remains a key priority, and those white space opportunities that Harvey alluded to are going to propel us forward. Now, let\u2019s just kind of level-set and remind everybody kind of where we\u2019ve been. We great FRE 40% in 2022 and over the past five years it\u2019s up about fourfold, and I think we are in great position to continue to do that over the next several years, but this year is not one of those growth years. This year is going to be--this growth trend is not even every year, and this year is a bit of a catch-up and get things in the right place. Let me level-set that a little bit for you. It\u2019s a complicated, complex market environment, as Harvey said in his opening remarks. M&A volumes are about half of what they were just last year. IPO activity is sluggish. U.S. leveraged loans are much smaller, smaller than they have been in many, many years, and so all that activity level is depressed and it impacts our earnings, our ability to generate transaction fees, impacts performance revenues, the lower level that you see is going to impact realizations, and even at Fortitude it affects our fees there, are variable rate, and so as Fortitude does well, we make more money, but mark-to-market types of adjustments impact some of those returns and so right now, it\u2019s at a lower level, and so that\u2019s also impacted our thinking with respect to the current year. But again, we\u2019re in great shape for the long term. We see lots of opportunities for long term growth here and think that we\u2019ll be set up, and we\u2019re going to be very disciplined in terms of how we approach the balance of this year and we\u2019re going to work really hard to outperform where we are.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you both.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Bill.\nCurtisis Buser: Thanks Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your question please, Alexander.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Hey, good morning everybody, and Harvey, good to hear from you as well.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey Alex.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey. Sticking with maybe some of the bigger picture kind of initiatives, as you look at areas of growth for Carlyle over the next couple of years, the firm has a really healthy balance sheet, to your point, on generating a substantial amount of cash flow. How are you approaching the capital return framework for the firm, and how are you thinking about inorganic opportunities within the context of the white space that you\u2019ve talked about?\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes, so the white space list that I went through, obviously that\u2019s not inclusive, right - I mean, that\u2019s not in total, right, so you saw announce the Fortitude transaction - there\u2019s a lot of room for that business to grow the capital markets business, and so our approach to all of this, as I said before, is going to be about patience and excellence of execution. You\u2019re right to point out the balance sheet strength - I think Curt and the team have done an extraordinary job of structuring the balance sheet, it was one of the things I diligenced before I came to the firm, and there\u2019s a lot of cash flow generation.  I think that all these things--I think in some respects, Alex, all these things kind of come down to math. We have a cost of capital, we have very strong cash flow and we have a very significant opportunity set, and so you\u2019re going to see us be quite disciplined about how we think about utilizing our capital, but we\u2019re going to invest in growth and we\u2019re going to be very thoughtful about how we deploy that capital. We\u2019re always going to be thoughtful about it. I think in this market environment, you should expect us to be exceptionally disciplined.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, that\u2019s helpful, thanks.\nHarvey Schwartz: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Brian.\nBrian Bedell: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Welcome, Harvey.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey Brian, nice to meet you.\nBrian Bedell: Nice to meet you. Just your comment about the valuation gap that you see at Carlyle, and the enormous opportunity to close that valuation gap, I realize there\u2019s a lot of things to invest in and a lot of white space, and that will create longer term pressure on expenses; but as you think longer term about the franchise in closing that valuation gap, how do you think about potentially changing the compensation structure to align more with some of the peers that have a higher FRE margin, and then how do you think about whether that is one way to do that as opposed to just scaling various businesses?\nCurtisis Buser: Hey Brian, it\u2019s Curt. Let me start and Harvey can add in. Look - our compensation structure, we use the combination obviously of cash, carry, equity, and you\u2019ve got to be very careful when you move the cheese. We think very carefully about how all this is set up and how we incentivize our people. The alignment that we have in place does a couple of things. First, it aligns with FRE growth and we\u2019ve had very good growth over the past four or five years in FRE. Second, it aligns with carry generation and performance for our LP investors - very important that we drive LP performance, and the carry that we\u2019ve thrown off, $1.5 billion net realized carry in \u201921, a billion dollars last year, that provides a lot of capital as well for the balance sheet, so that alignment is important and keeping people kind of focused on the long term trajectory of shareholder value. The equity awards obviously kind of play into that. All of those things matter, but you\u2019re right - we continue to evaluate how it could be better and drive further things. When we have something to announce in terms of a change, we\u2019ll be sure to make sure everybody is aware of that, but nothing new to announce today.\nHarvey Schwartz: The only thing I would say, because you mentioned the valuation gap, when I look at the valuation gap and when I was doing my diligence, I didn\u2019t look at it and say, oh, we want to be this firm or that firm. I just knew that it screamed opportunity because I know the power of the brand. What we\u2019re going to do is I think what you\u2019d hope we\u2019d do - we\u2019re going to listen quite carefully to our LPs, we\u2019re going to evaluate our strength internally, and we\u2019re going to marry those efforts together to make sure we deliver to our LPs, we drive growth, and we use our capital along the way. In terms of incentives, I think Curt captured it perfectly. We want our people to be incented, we have fantastic talent here. We want to attract the best talent, we want to retain the best talent, and so all these things are the way that we\u2019ll think through the compensation, and listen - we want to make sure people get paid for performance. That\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it philosophically. It\u2019s too early to comment on any specific changes, but I like Curt\u2019s language about the cheese - I don\u2019t think that was a prepared remark, by the way, we probably wouldn\u2019t have put that in a script, but I think he captured it well. \nBrian Bedell: Yes, that\u2019s great color. Thank you so much.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna of JMP Securities. Your question please, Brian.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. I believe it\u2019s me, Brian McKenna, but good morning all and welcome Harvey.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey Brian.\nBrian McKenna: Hey, how are you? It\u2019s great to see the Fortitude deal get announced a couple days ago, but Curt, can you just remind us about the fee arrangement for Fortitude and then how that evolves over time with underlying performance of that business, and then related, how does the pipeline look for these larger deals looking out over the next 12 to 18 months, and does Fortitude have incremental access to capital for some more deals moving forward or will they have to look to raise some additional capital?\nCurtisis Buser: Brian, thanks for the question, and thanks for the comments on Fortitude. Look - we\u2019re really proud of what the team has achieved. If you look in our release, there\u2019s about $55 billion of AUM, there\u2019s about another $9 billion that they have directly invested into our funds that\u2019s not captured in that number, and there\u2019s $28 billion on top of all that, and they\u2019re still out there hunting and looking. There\u2019s a big pipeline and it\u2019s a very well capitalized business, and we had said before that with the raise that we had done previously with our partners, that we were well set up to be able to about double the AUM there, and clearly we remain working on that. But keep in mind these are complicated transactions. Fortitude has done a good job of thinking through this, and they\u2019ve been able to do some things that are unique because of their skill set and how they\u2019re set up and their balance sheet, and these things aren\u2019t easy to get done. We\u2019re very proud of what they\u2019ve been able to achieve. We think we can do more there.  The fee arrangement - look, we\u2019re an investment advisor and so we fee really when they directly invest into our products and we fee off of how we help them perform, so that\u2019s a variable rate fee and as they perform well, generally over a trailing basis, we benefit. We grow our fees as they grow in size, and we grow our fees as they perform better, which we obviously contribute to. But look, markets are tough right now, and so some of that has also got this--you know, from a lower level, and we see upside potential from here in terms of fees off of that. But also keep in mind that this new $28 billion, it\u2019s not closed yet, so it will kind of contribute later in the year when it\u2019s ultimately closed. Hopefully that gives you some color, Brian. \nBrian McKenna: Yes, that\u2019s great. Appreciate it, Curt.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Company. Your question please, Chris.\nChris Kotowski: Yes, good morning. Curt in particular, I was wondering if you can give us some more color about the private equity fundraising environment. Obviously we\u2019ve been hearing about the denominator effect all year long last year, and one can only imagine that the post Silicon Valley environment, that that didn\u2019t help things any. But I also wonder if you can talk about it just a little bit on a geographic basis - you know, we\u2019ve heard about that denominator effect particularly as it relates to U.S. buy-outs, but you\u2019ve also got a very strong--two big Asian and European funds that are finishing up, I guess, their deployments and they\u2019ve got a strong track record, and I guess is there any particular strategy or insights you can give us as to how you hope to raise the successor funds there?\nCurtisis Buser: Hey Chris, good to hear your voice, and thank you for the question. Look, I am very proud of my partners, especially in the buy-out space and the private equity space - long, very successful track record, done a lot of great stuff over the years and fully eager to take advantage of opportunities as they are in the current environment. I think there\u2019s going to be some really neat deals done here in the near term, and I think that creates some just tremendous opportunities also in terms of encouragement from fundraising. But look, it\u2019s a tough fundraising environment and particularly in buy-out funds, and so based on what we see today, we think in the aggregate across all of the different buy-out funds, they\u2019re going to be somewhat smaller, maybe a little bit the same. But in the aggregate, the dollars are going to be lower than what the predecessors were. We still think this is a very good business for us and we can do a lot. What I\u2019m really encouraged about is the underlying portfolio, and the portfolio has really done well. Revenues are up across the PE space about 12% over the last 12 months. EBITDA continues to grow, up just shy of 10%. Margins have held up strong. From a financing perspective, there\u2019s no major issues in the PE space. Over half of the debt across the portfolio is fixed or hedged, and roughly 95% of the debt has maturities in 2025 or later. That\u2019s all really important, because it tees us up to really generate the types of returns that we\u2019ve done in the past and makes me very encouraged about the $4 billion of net accrued carry on our balance sheet and how we turn that into cash in the coming years. It will be a little slow this year, but feel really good about that $4 billion, and look - giving capital back to our LPs obviously is helpful and is what our teams are very much focused on. Hopefully that gives you some color, Chris.\nChris Kotowski: Okay, yes. Thank you, that\u2019s it for me.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, Rufus.\nRufus Hone: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much.  Wanted to come back to the insurance transaction with Lincoln. Can you speak to how competitive that deal was, and then can you help us with what the FRE contribution from this deal might be and how quickly do you expect to be able to migrate the 20% of general account assets into Carlyle group funds and hit the full FRE run rate contribution you expect there? Thank you.\nCurtisis Buser: Rufus, look - I\u2019m a little sensitive on some of these components. We\u2019re also dealing with a public company as the seller, so I\u2019m going to be a little careful in terms of how I answer this. But this sets us up real nicely for growth, particularly in 2024. I think the transaction - very carefully negotiated, I think our team worked really closely with the seller. I don\u2019t want to speak too much in terms of how competitive, but we were uniquely positioned to be able to do the transaction, and especially something of this size and complexity, and really solving the needs of all parties, so I feel good about that. The amount that will directly come into our funds, some of it as quick as this year. Obviously we\u2019ve got to get it closed first, but you would kind of think of that mostly over a two to three-year period. But the one thing I will say is Fortitude has been pretty aggressive in terms of migrating stuff pretty quickly - you know, exclusive of this, already at $9 billion committed or invested into Carlyle strategies, and looking to do the same. First and foremost, though, we\u2019re motivated through our fee arrangement to make sure that Fortitude does well and that we\u2019re a good advisor to them, regardless of whether that comes directly into Carlyle product or into other types of assets. We\u2019re seeking to help them perform really well. Thanks Rufus.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nCurtisis Buser: Good morning Ken.\nKenneth Worthington : Hi, good morning. I wanted to extend on insurance. We\u2019re seeing a much greater integration of insurance in alternative asset managers, and there is some different approaches that your peers have taken to growing insurance. You mentioned that there\u2019s opportunities to grow here. Where does insurance or the insurance opportunity fit in your priority stack for Carlyle growth, and do you think Carlyle has the credit breadth to sort of maximize this insurance opportunity? For Carlyle, Fortitude seems to be the focus of the strategy here. Does that focus on one insurance company really make sense, or to get big, do you need to broaden out the presence? A bunch there, but thank you.\nCurtisis Buser: Hey Ken, I\u2019ll start and Harvey can add in. First, we serve a number of insurance investors. We\u2019re an investment advisor, we\u2019re not an insurance company, and so Fortitude, obviously because of our history of strategic investments with them and with our partners, that\u2019s why we tend to in these calls emphasize that, but there\u2019s a number of insurance companies that our credit team is routinely working with for a number of products.  The growth in our credit business has been fantastic. We\u2019ve doubled FRE there, doubled the AUM, Mark Jenkins and the team have just done a super job there, and they\u2019re very much focused on the insurance channel and taking advantage of it, and so doing a lot there. Again, you want to be always thinking about how to grow the business and grow it in a disciplined, profitable way, and they\u2019re doing just that. In terms of Fortitude itself, as it continues to scale, I think we\u2019ll also see more steady flows of investments coming off of that, and I think that that also will help Carlyle from a growth and planning and getting things coordinated. But I like where we are, I like kind of the breadth and I like kind of the relationship we have with Fortitude, and again Fortitude has a very deep pipeline of other opportunities and it will pursue that, and from a Carlyle perspective, we\u2019re here to support them. They\u2019re a separate company and there are other investors we work with. I don\u2019t know, Harvey, if you have anything to add to that?\nHarvey Schwartz: No, I think Curt covered it very well. I would just say again, in my first 80 days or so of being here, it\u2019s clearly obvious the strategic power of being an investor in Fortitude and its alignment with the firm and the growth of our credit business, and so again it\u2019s very high on the priority list but there are a lot of good opportunities. This is one of them.\nKenneth Worthington: Great, thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thank you.\nCurtisis Buser: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty of UBS. Adam, your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Thanks very much, good morning. Welcome to Harvey. \nHarvey Schwartz: Thank you.\nAdam Beatty: Appreciate you\u2019re taking all these questions. I wanted to follow up on the valuation gap, and appreciate all your thoughts so far this morning. But just from the angle of perception, I was wondering if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019ve been hearing in your discussions with LPs or investors in the stock, or even sell side or what have you, that\u2019s just a misperception, where you\u2019re already starting to think, hey, this is something where we\u2019re actually not the way we\u2019re perceived, and we just have to correct that. Thanks very much.\nHarvey Schwartz: No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we have to correct. I guess I would say it like this - when I talk to LPs, and I talk to LPs all around the world, I think it\u2019s just crystal clear the brand is way more powerful than the valuation right now, and so that\u2019s why I say, we just have to close that valuation gap. The brand is incredible, and so we just have to work with our teams, we have to execute, we have to grow this opportunity set that Curt and I have been talking about, but the brand is great. It\u2019s disproportionate to the valuation, and the valuation just needs to be as great as the brand. \nAdam Beatty: Got it, thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nHarvey Schwartz: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish of Barclays. Your question please, Ben.\nBen Budish: Hi there. Thanks so much for taking the question; and Harvey, great to meet you, if only over the phone here. \nHarvey Schwartz: Morning Ben, you too.\nBen Budish: You know, you guys have talked a lot about the big opportunity set you see going forward, and I think on the last call, I think Curt, you mentioned that you see an opportunity for the company to grow FRE well into the double digits over the medium term. I wanted to ask about how you see private equity fitting in there, just given the step down in expectations for the current vintage of funds. What are your longer term thoughts on how that business can grow from an AUM and FRE perspective?\nCurtisis Buser: Ben, good to hear your voice and hear the question. Our private equity business has a long, long track record, not every vintage is going to necessarily be up, and keep in mind that our private equity business is fairly diverse. Look - you\u2019ve got our real estate business, world-class business, we see that we can kind of clearly grow in there. We have an infrastructure and natural resources business that we\u2019re focused on in terms of helping it to grow, and I think that there will be other--and our growth capital business has also done exceptionally well, some fantastic returns. Look, I think there will be other products that we\u2019ll also be exploring and taking advantage of, and from a private wealth standpoint, while still in its infancy in terms of where things are, a lot of the private wealth channel would love to have access to those product sets. That\u2019s something for us to explore more in the longer term, but it\u2019s out there. I think that there is lots of ways that that business can continue to grow, and look - we will also be disciplined and smart in terms of making sure we have the right resources, set the right way with really the asset base, so very optimistic about it.\nBen Budish: I appreciate the color, thanks.\nCurtisis Buser: Thanks Ben.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuma Nwankwo of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Chuma.\nChuma Nwankwo: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and welcome Harvey.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey, nice to meet you.\nChuma Nwankwo: Hi there, nice to meet you too. I\u2019m standing in for Michael Cyprys, by the way - he\u2019s just tied up on another call.  Just wonder if I could go back to the Fortitude transaction and talk a little bit about the opportunity you see there with the transition of the general account assets. I think in the past, you\u2019ve previously talked about sort of mid-teens, and now you\u2019re talking about 20% here, so nice to see that, I guess, above expectations. I guess the question is, how should we think about that 20%? Would you be disappointed if you didn\u2019t do better than that? Also going back to the question about white space, what products do you see those assets potentially transitioning into that you have today, and where could there be potential for more product development to increase the scope for more of these insurance assets to be deployed? Thank you.\nCurtisis Buser: Let me start on that. On the 20%, I think you\u2019re assuming a degree of--more degree of precision than how we think about it. It\u2019s roughly 20%. Obviously we\u2019re looking to assist Fortitude in doing what\u2019s right for Fortitude, and if that can be more, then we\u2019ll collectively together with Fortitude to be more. If it should be a tad less, that\u2019s also the right answer. We\u2019re looking to work with Fortitude on that.  The assets that can come in - look, I mean, we\u2019re going to be--again, what\u2019s the right way to approach and that, and as I think I previously said, I think we can start to transition some of that quickly, and some of it will take a longer period of time, but it\u2019s about really kind of helping them from that perspective. You know, we\u2019ve talked about the other products in terms of white space, and from a long term growth perspective, I\u2019d just reiterate that we can see 2024 and following years really being a return to growth in FRE and continue to feel good about our $4 billion of net accrued carry and how that will generate and provide higher distributable earnings on a longer term basis.  Hopefully that addresses your question.\nChuma Nwankwo: Thank you for the color, appreciate it.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Daniel Harris for closing remarks. Sir?\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey everyone, again on behalf of the team here, Curt and Dan and everyone, just want to thank you for participating on the call. Again, for those of you I know, great to catch up again, and for those of you I haven\u2019t met yet, I look forward to catching up with you shortly.  Again, thanks for your interest. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks Dan. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. It's great to be here with all of you. Some of you I've worked with in the past, and others, it will be great to meet you soon. There are three things I plan to review today: our first quarter performance, the macro environment and our general outlook, and lastly I'll end with some initial thoughts on my first 80 days here at Carlyle. First with regards to our performance, let me be clear - we're not pleased with our first quarter results. Curt will walk you through the details, but our activity levels and investments, realizations and fundraising were more muted than our prior expectations. We continue to navigate one of the most complex financial markets in recent memory which is clouding the near term outlook and impacting market sentiment. It's our expectation these effects will last throughout the remainder of the year and impact both FRE and distributable earnings. That said, importantly we are confident that Carlyle is well positioned for when market stabilized and activity levels ultimately pick up. We don't invest and we don't run the firm quarter to quarter. The firm has a long history of successfully investing through all cycles. We have a leading private equity business with a long term track record, a fast growing global credit business and a higher performing investment solutions business. We have $381 billion of assets under management and $73 billion in capital available to deploy across strategies and geographies, and we have longstanding, very deep relationships with the largest and most sophisticated global investors. There is substantial and very attractive white space for Carlyle to continue to grow our platform which alongside a disciplined approach to running the firm will ultimately expand margins, expand FRE, and grow distributable earnings. Shifting now to the macro environment, for the past 30 to 40 years, there were several mega trends at play. These mega trends underpinned economic activity. A long term down trend in interest rates supporting an upward trend in equity markets and asset prices broadly, markets benefiting from historically low inflation, and increased globalization and technological innovation allowed global economies to thrive. Today for the first time in many investors' lifetimes, some of those trends are slowing or even reversing. The cost of capital has gone up. Discount rates and cap rates have increased and are pressuring valuations, as well as expected returns. Of course, this shift in trends will take time to work through global markets and asset prices. Adding even more complexity, while the banking system in the U.S. and abroad generally have healthy balance sheets from years of capital building, they are now tightening underwriting standards and regional banks, following recent stress, are likely to face increased regulation and capital requirements. In my experience, this will almost certainly lead to a further tightening of lending standards, dampening the pace of economic activity. While companies are not raising capital at the same frequency as prior years, their core needs haven't changed. They need capital to grow and capital to refinance liabilities. This is where our global credit business is taking share from traditional lenders, and just this week you will have seen Fortitude announce a major reinsurance transaction that will accelerate the growth of their business. For our LPs who require help managing their portfolios in this complex environment, our global investment solutions business is well positioned to meet this demand and continue to grow the platform. The important point to remember is that Carlyle has operated through significant market dislocations before. We remain actively engaged with sellers, buyers and capital providers around the world - we're very front-footed. We certainly don't invest for any single quarter or year. We raise capital and we invest for the long term. The opportunities across asset classes, regions and sectors are growing increasingly more attractive as markets remain volatile and uncertain. While we remain cautious on the near term environment, we also are beginning to see opportunities to put a huge amount of capital to work that will help drive long term performance and asset growth. This is an exciting time to be an investor in global private markets.  I'll close with some thoughts since I've gotten started in my new role. I spent the past few months meeting our people and getting to know our investors around the world. Carlyle is an iconic brand, one I've admired my entire career. We have an experienced and talented team of professionals who are up for any challenge, and that team is a big part of why I'm here. Our culture is strong. It reflects the 35-year history of the firm and is made up of a group of talented, smart, hard-working, world-class professionals who care deeply about our firm, and we are committed to being a fiduciary for our clients. We are in an industry that is growing and there is massive long term potential for Carlyle. Everything starts with investment performance, and our firm was built to provide the highest level of care to our investors and to capture the significant opportunities that continue to emerge. Throughout my career, I've been a believer in disciplined growth. As we grow, we are also working to identify areas where we can instill more discipline around our operations. This approach will deliver returns for our shareholders and fund investors alike. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Carlyle, and I'm very excited to be here and be part of it. With that, I'll hand things over to Curt to provide a more detailed breakdown of the quarter. Thanks Curt. Before we move onto Q&A, I wanted to reiterate that while there are near term challenges, there is tremendous long term opportunity for the firm. The overall positive trends in the industry and the strength of our brand and our people - well, these are the reasons why I'm here. It really is quite a privilege to be part of this team and part of this firm. Let me turn the call over to the Operator so we can take your questions. Again, great to be here with you. Hey Glenn. Glenn, you're just breaking up a little bit. Okay, well Glenn, it's good to hear your voice, even a little garbled, but nice to chat with you again. I hope you've been well. Maybe I should back up for a second, and before I get directly to your question, maybe I should just talk a little bit about why I'm here and how I got here, and that decision-making process. As I said in my remarks, I've known about Carlyle for my entire career. It's an amazing brand. I know the power of an amazing brand. Since I met with the founders, we clicked immediately, and as I got to know the people, I knew the talent in the organization and the investing prowess, and then really when I looked at the valuation gap between our firm and other firms, it just didn't make any sense to me, and so the decision to be here actually ended up being quite easy and, as I said, really quite a privilege for me to be part of this team and part of this firm. Now I've been here, I don't know, give or take 80 days, the team reminded me, and I sort of jokingly, or I refer to it sort of in my own Carlyle immersion course, I've just been spending time with our LPs, spending time with the teams, getting to know everyone, and probably more importantly giving them a chance to get to know me. In terms of the white space, there's just a lot of opportunity for us. We have businesses like global credit, which have been growing very quickly. We'll continue to grow those. There's the private wealth space, real estate, one of the highest performing real estate teams, there's a lot of interest there, our solutions business. You know, when you go around the firm, there's a lot of energy to grow these businesses. Now it's early days for me, but I can tell you the enthusiasm and the energy is real.  Did we lose you, Glenn? No, I just thought maybe I lost you. No, you are limited to one question, Glenn. You too. We can hear you, don't worry. Thank you. Well, the disciplined growth, that's just always the way I've approached businesses that I've been part of, it's the way the team here approaches things, and so that, again, I would say is more philosophically my approach but has also been the philosophy of the firm.  You know, I don't think it's a--how do I say this? I don't really have any favorite children, so I like growth for growth's sake. We have a lot of resources here, and so if there's demand for our solutions business, we'll respond to that; if there's demand for growing the private wealth footprint, there's a lot of people in the world that want access to Carlyle and Carlyle investing capability. Some things will take longer, some things will be more immediate, but I don't think it's a question of prioritizing one or two things. I think it's a question of as a team, we mobilize against all these things but we do it quite thoughtfully. We're not going to rush. I'm certainly not in a rush, and it's really going to be about excellence of execution and however long that takes. I think it's more about excellence of execution, but the opportunities are clear. Thanks Bill. Hey Alex. Yes, so the white space list that I went through, obviously that's not inclusive, right - I mean, that's not in total, right, so you saw announce the Fortitude transaction - there's a lot of room for that business to grow the capital markets business, and so our approach to all of this, as I said before, is going to be about patience and excellence of execution. You're right to point out the balance sheet strength - I think Curt and the team have done an extraordinary job of structuring the balance sheet, it was one of the things I diligenced before I came to the firm, and there's a lot of cash flow generation.  I think that all these things--I think in some respects, Alex, all these things kind of come down to math. We have a cost of capital, we have very strong cash flow and we have a very significant opportunity set, and so you're going to see us be quite disciplined about how we think about utilizing our capital, but we're going to invest in growth and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we deploy that capital. We're always going to be thoughtful about it. I think in this market environment, you should expect us to be exceptionally disciplined. Sure. Hey Brian, nice to meet you. The only thing I would say, because you mentioned the valuation gap, when I look at the valuation gap and when I was doing my diligence, I didn't look at it and say, oh, we want to be this firm or that firm. I just knew that it screamed opportunity because I know the power of the brand. What we're going to do is I think what you'd hope we'd do - we're going to listen quite carefully to our LPs, we're going to evaluate our strength internally, and we're going to marry those efforts together to make sure we deliver to our LPs, we drive growth, and we use our capital along the way. In terms of incentives, I think Curt captured it perfectly. We want our people to be incented, we have fantastic talent here. We want to attract the best talent, we want to retain the best talent, and so all these things are the way that we'll think through the compensation, and listen - we want to make sure people get paid for performance. That's how I'm thinking about it philosophically. It's too early to comment on any specific changes, but I like Curt's language about the cheese - I don't think that was a prepared remark, by the way, we probably wouldn't have put that in a script, but I think he captured it well. Thank you. Hey Brian. Thanks Brian. Thanks Chris. No, I think Curt covered it very well. I would just say again, in my first 80 days or so of being here, it's clearly obvious the strategic power of being an investor in Fortitude and its alignment with the firm and the growth of our credit business, and so again it's very high on the priority list but there are a lot of good opportunities. This is one of them. Thank you. Thank you. No, I don't think there's anything we have to correct. I guess I would say it like this - when I talk to LPs, and I talk to LPs all around the world, I think it's just crystal clear the brand is way more powerful than the valuation right now, and so that's why I say, we just have to close that valuation gap. The brand is incredible, and so we just have to work with our teams, we have to execute, we have to grow this opportunity set that Curt and I have been talking about, but the brand is great. It's disproportionate to the valuation, and the valuation just needs to be as great as the brand. Sure. Morning Ben, you too. Thanks. Hey, nice to meet you. Thank you. Hey everyone, again on behalf of the team here, Curt and Dan and everyone, just want to thank you for participating on the call. Again, for those of you I know, great to catch up again, and for those of you I haven't met yet, I look forward to catching up with you shortly.  Again, thanks for your interest. Have a great day."

            "content": "Harvey, why don't I take the second part of Bill's question, really, on FRE and the revised guidance. Look - we've been focused on growing FRE. It remains a key priority, and those white space opportunities that Harvey alluded to are going to propel us forward. Now, let's just kind of level-set and remind everybody kind of where we've been. We great FRE 40% in 2022 and over the past five years it's up about fourfold, and I think we are in great position to continue to do that over the next several years, but this year is not one of those growth years. This year is going to be--this growth trend is not even every year, and this year is a bit of a catch-up and get things in the right place. Let me level-set that a little bit for you. It's a complicated, complex market environment, as Harvey said in his opening remarks. M&A volumes are about half of what they were just last year. IPO activity is sluggish. U.S. leveraged loans are much smaller, smaller than they have been in many, many years, and so all that activity level is depressed and it impacts our earnings, our ability to generate transaction fees, impacts performance revenues, the lower level that you see is going to impact realizations, and even at Fortitude it affects our fees there, are variable rate, and so as Fortitude does well, we make more money, but mark-to-market types of adjustments impact some of those returns and so right now, it's at a lower level, and so that's also impacted our thinking with respect to the current year. But again, we're in great shape for the long term. We see lots of opportunities for long term growth here and think that we'll be set up, and we're going to be very disciplined in terms of how we approach the balance of this year and we're going to work really hard to outperform where we are. Thanks Bill. Hey Brian, it's Curt. Let me start and Harvey can add in. Look - our compensation structure, we use the combination obviously of cash, carry, equity, and you've got to be very careful when you move the cheese. We think very carefully about how all this is set up and how we incentivize our people. The alignment that we have in place does a couple of things. First, it aligns with FRE growth and we've had very good growth over the past four or five years in FRE. Second, it aligns with carry generation and performance for our LP investors - very important that we drive LP performance, and the carry that we've thrown off, $1.5 billion net realized carry in '21, a billion dollars last year, that provides a lot of capital as well for the balance sheet, so that alignment is important and keeping people kind of focused on the long term trajectory of shareholder value. The equity awards obviously kind of play into that. All of those things matter, but you're right - we continue to evaluate how it could be better and drive further things. When we have something to announce in terms of a change, we'll be sure to make sure everybody is aware of that, but nothing new to announce today. Brian, thanks for the question, and thanks for the comments on Fortitude. Look - we're really proud of what the team has achieved. If you look in our release, there's about $55 billion of AUM, there's about another $9 billion that they have directly invested into our funds that's not captured in that number, and there's $28 billion on top of all that, and they're still out there hunting and looking. There's a big pipeline and it's a very well capitalized business, and we had said before that with the raise that we had done previously with our partners, that we were well set up to be able to about double the AUM there, and clearly we remain working on that. But keep in mind these are complicated transactions. Fortitude has done a good job of thinking through this, and they've been able to do some things that are unique because of their skill set and how they're set up and their balance sheet, and these things aren't easy to get done. We're very proud of what they've been able to achieve. We think we can do more there.  The fee arrangement - look, we're an investment advisor and so we fee really when they directly invest into our products and we fee off of how we help them perform, so that's a variable rate fee and as they perform well, generally over a trailing basis, we benefit. We grow our fees as they grow in size, and we grow our fees as they perform better, which we obviously contribute to. But look, markets are tough right now, and so some of that has also got this--you know, from a lower level, and we see upside potential from here in terms of fees off of that. But also keep in mind that this new $28 billion, it's not closed yet, so it will kind of contribute later in the year when it's ultimately closed. Hopefully that gives you some color, Brian. Hey Chris, good to hear your voice, and thank you for the question. Look, I am very proud of my partners, especially in the buy-out space and the private equity space - long, very successful track record, done a lot of great stuff over the years and fully eager to take advantage of opportunities as they are in the current environment. I think there's going to be some really neat deals done here in the near term, and I think that creates some just tremendous opportunities also in terms of encouragement from fundraising. But look, it's a tough fundraising environment and particularly in buy-out funds, and so based on what we see today, we think in the aggregate across all of the different buy-out funds, they're going to be somewhat smaller, maybe a little bit the same. But in the aggregate, the dollars are going to be lower than what the predecessors were. We still think this is a very good business for us and we can do a lot. What I'm really encouraged about is the underlying portfolio, and the portfolio has really done well. Revenues are up across the PE space about 12% over the last 12 months. EBITDA continues to grow, up just shy of 10%. Margins have held up strong. From a financing perspective, there's no major issues in the PE space. Over half of the debt across the portfolio is fixed or hedged, and roughly 95% of the debt has maturities in 2025 or later. That's all really important, because it tees us up to really generate the types of returns that we've done in the past and makes me very encouraged about the $4 billion of net accrued carry on our balance sheet and how we turn that into cash in the coming years. It will be a little slow this year, but feel really good about that $4 billion, and look - giving capital back to our LPs obviously is helpful and is what our teams are very much focused on. Hopefully that gives you some color, Chris. Rufus, look - I'm a little sensitive on some of these components. We're also dealing with a public company as the seller, so I'm going to be a little careful in terms of how I answer this. But this sets us up real nicely for growth, particularly in 2024. I think the transaction - very carefully negotiated, I think our team worked really closely with the seller. I don't want to speak too much in terms of how competitive, but we were uniquely positioned to be able to do the transaction, and especially something of this size and complexity, and really solving the needs of all parties, so I feel good about that. The amount that will directly come into our funds, some of it as quick as this year. Obviously we've got to get it closed first, but you would kind of think of that mostly over a two to three-year period. But the one thing I will say is Fortitude has been pretty aggressive in terms of migrating stuff pretty quickly - you know, exclusive of this, already at $9 billion committed or invested into Carlyle strategies, and looking to do the same. First and foremost, though, we're motivated through our fee arrangement to make sure that Fortitude does well and that we're a good advisor to them, regardless of whether that comes directly into Carlyle product or into other types of assets. We're seeking to help them perform really well. Thanks Rufus. Good morning Ken. Hey Ken, I'll start and Harvey can add in. First, we serve a number of insurance investors. We're an investment advisor, we're not an insurance company, and so Fortitude, obviously because of our history of strategic investments with them and with our partners, that's why we tend to in these calls emphasize that, but there's a number of insurance companies that our credit team is routinely working with for a number of products.  The growth in our credit business has been fantastic. We've doubled FRE there, doubled the AUM, Mark Jenkins and the team have just done a super job there, and they're very much focused on the insurance channel and taking advantage of it, and so doing a lot there. Again, you want to be always thinking about how to grow the business and grow it in a disciplined, profitable way, and they're doing just that. In terms of Fortitude itself, as it continues to scale, I think we'll also see more steady flows of investments coming off of that, and I think that that also will help Carlyle from a growth and planning and getting things coordinated. But I like where we are, I like kind of the breadth and I like kind of the relationship we have with Fortitude, and again Fortitude has a very deep pipeline of other opportunities and it will pursue that, and from a Carlyle perspective, we're here to support them. They're a separate company and there are other investors we work with. I don't know, Harvey, if you have anything to add to that? Thanks Ken. Ben, good to hear your voice and hear the question. Our private equity business has a long, long track record, not every vintage is going to necessarily be up, and keep in mind that our private equity business is fairly diverse. Look - you've got our real estate business, world-class business, we see that we can kind of clearly grow in there. We have an infrastructure and natural resources business that we're focused on in terms of helping it to grow, and I think that there will be other--and our growth capital business has also done exceptionally well, some fantastic returns. Look, I think there will be other products that we'll also be exploring and taking advantage of, and from a private wealth standpoint, while still in its infancy in terms of where things are, a lot of the private wealth channel would love to have access to those product sets. That's something for us to explore more in the longer term, but it's out there. I think that there is lots of ways that that business can continue to grow, and look - we will also be disciplined and smart in terms of making sure we have the right resources, set the right way with really the asset base, so very optimistic about it. Thanks Ben. Let me start on that. On the 20%, I think you're assuming a degree of--more degree of precision than how we think about it. It's roughly 20%. Obviously we're looking to assist Fortitude in doing what's right for Fortitude, and if that can be more, then we'll collectively together with Fortitude to be more. If it should be a tad less, that's also the right answer. We're looking to work with Fortitude on that.  The assets that can come in - look, I mean, we're going to be--again, what's the right way to approach and that, and as I think I previously said, I think we can start to transition some of that quickly, and some of it will take a longer period of time, but it's about really kind of helping them from that perspective. You know, we've talked about the other products in terms of white space, and from a long term growth perspective, I'd just reiterate that we can see 2024 and following years really being a return to growth in FRE and continue to feel good about our $4 billion of net accrued carry and how that will generate and provide higher distributable earnings on a longer term basis.  Hopefully that addresses your question."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Curtis Buser",
            "content": "Thank you Harvey, and good morning everyone. I want to start with an outlook on three particular areas that complement Harvey's comments and put our financial results in context with the current macro environment. First with respect to fundraising, we continue to expect to raise more capital this year than we did last year, though the composition of that fundraising has skewed further towards global credit and investment solutions and less from corporate private equity. Over the balance of this year, we expect to see CLO issuance resume in addition to incremental fundraising for a number of credit products, as well as raising capital in our secondaries and co-investment strategies and investment solutions.  While we believe that we will attract a significant amount of capital for our next vintage of buy-out funds, we no longer expect these funds in the aggregate to be the same size as their predecessors and now expect to see a decline in buy-out fund sizes across most geographies.  Second, as you heard Harvey indicate, we expect that the slowdown in capital markets activity will result in a muted level of near term realizations, pressure on capital markets transaction fees, and lower performance-related earnings. That said, we continue to have $4 billion in net accrued carry and believe the firm's ability to monetize that carry will be strong over the next few years. Third, our 2023 [indiscernible] outlook. Given uncertainty in current market conditions, including the impact from a slower transactional environment and a lower buy-out fundraising outlook, our 2023 FRE is likely to be modestly below last year. While we expect to see top line fee growth this year, we also expect to see continued investments into our teams and businesses. We will be disciplined managing our expenses while at the same time ensuring the firm is well positioned to grow over time, notably across our global credit platform, extending the capabilities of our capital markets team and supporting continued growth at Fortitude. Now let me dig a bit deeper into the major drivers of our results. Fee-related earnings of $193 million increased 6% over the first quarter of 2022. Top line management fees of $506 million were up 11% year-over-year, with the strongest growth in our global credit platform through a combination of organic growth and the impact from strategic transactions last year. Fee earning assets under management of $271 billion increased 29% from the first quarter last year, driven by $28 billion of fundraising over that same time period alongside strategic transactions completed last year. Two days ago on May 2, Fortitude announced an agreement to reinsure $28 billion of life and fixed annuity products. This Fortitude transaction is a great example of its strategy to become a preferred solutions provider to large global insurers as it leverages its strong balance sheet and broad capabilities to pursue growth. Fortitude expects to close this transaction in mid-2023, pending customary regulatory approvals. When the transaction closes, Carlyle's fee-earnings assets under management will increase by the amount of the reinsurance transaction as part of our strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude, and over time we expect about 20% of the general account assets related to this transaction to be directly invested into Carlyle investment strategies. The impact of this transaction was included in our updated fee-related earnings outlook for the year. Fee-related performance revenue of $29 million in the first quarter was down from $45 million last year as the contribution from core plus real estate was muted in the first quarter, while global credit fee-related performance revenue was up more than 30%. Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect to benefit from a substantially higher level of fee-related performance revenue in global private equity. This is because we expect a significant step-up in the crystallizing of gains next quarter in core plus real estate, which will then moderate in the following quarters.  As we have previously noted, we expect to generate significant revenues in this line item every year, though certain quarters throughout the year will be higher than others. Also keep in mind that fee-related performance revenue's compensation expense, which is captured in our FRE compensation line, will vary directly at about 45% of revenue. FRE margin was 35% this quarter, down modestly from 36% in the first quarter of last year. While total fee revenues were up 7% compared to last year, FRE expenses increased 8%, leading to the margin compression. For the full year, we expect FRE margin to be modestly lower compared to 2022. Longer term, scaling the firm and operating effectively remains a key priority, and we expect to see FRE margins resume their upward trend in 2024. Moving on, our portfolio continues to perform well relative to choppy public markets, with overall portfolio appreciation of 2% in the first quarter across our carry funds and appreciation of 7% over the past 12 months. This is well higher relative to a 9% decline in the MSCI All-Country World Index over that same time period.  Our global credit carry fund portfolio rose 3% in the quarter and is also up 7% over the last 12 months, while our corporate private equity portfolio was up 1% in the quarter and 3% over the past year. Appreciation in our infrastructure and natural resources portfolio was flat in the quarter amidst volatile but range-bound energy prices, but this portfolio is still up 24% over the last 12 months, and appreciation in our global investment solutions funds was up 5% in the quarter and 7% over the past year. A few other quick points. Equity-based compensation expense of $57 million increased from $41 million in the first quarter last year as an elevated level of equity grants to employees and our new CEO grants in February began to impact results. We expect to see this expense tick higher in the second quarter and then remain at an elevated level. We repurchased $100 million in shares in the first quarter, and as of March 31 our board of directors reset and increased our repurchase authorization to $500 million.  Our balance sheet remains solid, over $1 billion in cash and nothing drawn against our $1 billion revolver. We have the flexibility to remain opportunistic if prospects arise to deploy our valuable capital. As we have said before, our DE effective tax rate is likely to be volatile on a quarterly basis, and this quarter it was lower than normal but we still expect it to average around 20% on an annualized basis. In sum, while there are some short term challenges, we are optimistic long term and see opportunities for growth and value creation.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Harvey, who would like to make a few closing remarks."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Carlyle's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz; and our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Strategy, John Redett. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release to the extent reasonably available. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time. In order to ensure participation by all those on the call today, please limit yourself to one question and return to the queue for any additional follow-ups. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Dan. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Over the past year and a half, we undertook several strategic actions to drive better performance, including realigning our compensation model, appointing new leadership, and prioritizing margin expansion among other initiatives. As we stand here today, you're beginning to see the early impacts of those steps. These actions, combined with a pickup in activity across the platform, generated one of the best quarterly performances in the firm's history. We delivered record quarterly fee-related earnings, up 36% versus the third quarter of 2023 and our best ever FRE margins at 47%, up more than 10 percentage points since last year. Overall, we are on track to hit our FRE target of $1.1 billion for the year. Our underlying investment portfolio is performing very well. This drove strong corporate private equity fund appreciation that fueled a nearly 30% increase in our net accrued performance revenues compared to the prior quarter. This accrual represents nearly $8 per share of future earnings for our shareholders. As we talked about previously, capital markets was a significantly underleveraged part of our platform that is gaining substantial momentum. This is the direct result of proactive steps we've taken to increase alignment around transaction fee generation. Including closed Q4 activity, we've already generated our highest level of annual transaction fees. This, despite a still subdued M&A and IPO environment. Obviously, we expect further growth in capital markets fees. On fundraising, we raised $9 billion of new capital in the quarter and have raised $43 billion over the past 12 months. We anticipate a very strong fourth quarter of capital raising to close out the year, and we continue to target about $40 billion of inflows for the year. Now switching to the macro environment. Obviously, let's start with the election results. Being past the election has removed market uncertainty, first and foremost. Markets like certainty and you're seeing that broadly across capital markets, particularly in the stock market yesterday. Over the medium to long-term, this should be a further catalyst for IPOs, M&A, and key sectors we invest in. This should be an environment in which we are well positioned to capitalize on monetization opportunities and put capital to work. Prior to election, we had already seen the U.S. Federal Reserve shift in stance on interest rates and that was a clear sign that we entered a new era of monetary policy and that inflation has stabilized. The election certainty and the change in monetary policy are a powerful combination supporting economic growth and our business. We're already seeing a significant uptick in IPO activity this year. There's been a 30% increase in listings and a 50% increase in IPO proceeds in the first nine months of this year. We've seen this trend benefit our portfolio as well with two significant IPOs in just the last month, StandardAero in the U.S. and Rigaku in Japan. StandardAero marked the second largest sponsor-backed U.S. IPO of the year and the best first-day performance for U.S. IPO, raising over $1 billion, this since 2021. Aerospace, defense, and government services is a key power alley for Carlyle. Our roots in D.C. and more than 30-year history in this space is a core differentiator for us. This was the largest aerospace IPO ever and demonstrates that the market is starved for high-quality businesses and growth outside of the tech sector. Rigaku is the second biggest Japanese IPO this year and the largest ever sponsored-backed IPO in Japan. Japan remains a very attractive market for us. This year's improved market sentiment has driven stronger investment activity and a more active pipeline across our platform, reflecting our ability to act on opportunities in a dynamic environment. A more liquid realization backdrop and strong underlying portfolio performance have supported higher investment returns. Our two largest U.S. buyout funds were up north of 7% each this quarter, and our two largest Asia buyout funds were up 9% and 13%, respectively. This quarter represented the third largest quarterly increase in net accrued performance revenues in our firm's history. Over $600 million of net performance revenues were generated. Switching to Global Wealth, another area of strategic focus, we're seeing strong momentum across the platform, where we benefited from a record $1.8 billion of wealth inflows. Our wealth inflows this quarter were nearly 3 times the amount in the previous quarter, and our global wealth AUM is up 70% year-over-year. Part of the momentum is our newly launched secondaries wealth solution, CAPM, which is seeing very strong early traction with advisers and their clients. We're also making progress in our private equity wealth product and are still on track to launch in 2025. Another area where we see accelerating growth is in asset-backed finance. We continue to identify differentiated partnerships with specialty finance companies to further bolster our origination capabilities and give us a data edge in the market. We've also seen record leveraged loan and CLO issuance in 2024. Loan spreads have tightened to post-GFC levels and demand for new paper is outpacing supply. Full year 2024 U.S. leveraged loan issuance is expected to exceed $1 trillion for only the third time. At Carlyle, the team has been very busy with our leading CLO business having priced 22 transactions globally on track to be a record year of resets and transactions priced. The opportunities in our insurance business remain quite significant. Fortitude has grown its general account assets by almost 70% in the past year. It has increased its excess capital position to more than $1 billion, allowing us to pursue a robust reinsurance pipeline. We also continue to grow our relationships with insurance clients broadly and further leverage our private investment-grade and asset-backed finance capabilities in this important channel. To wrap things up, we had a strong third quartile with Carlyle extremely well positioned to capitalize on an improving macroeconomic environment. Our leadership team remains laser-focused on driving performance and accelerating growth to drive long-term value for you, our shareholders. With that, let me now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Redett: Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the progress we've made over the last year. The business is just performing much better than it was 12 months ago, and we are also benefiting from a material step-up in market activity. The actions we've taken over the past year include improving FRE margins, activating the capital markets flywheel, improving investment performance, realigning our compensation strategy, appointing new leadership, and we continue to see benefits of the revised capital allocation strategy we implemented this year. These actions have generated significant operating leverage and momentum across our business, including record AUM of $447 billion, up 17% compared to last year; record fee-earning AUM of $314 billion, which has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last five years; record quarterly FRE of $278 million at a 47% FRE margin; and strong performance in our corporate private equity funds, which drove a material shift higher in net accrued performance revenues to $2.8 billion. We produced $367 million in DE for the quarter or $0.95 in DE per share. And year-to-date DE per share of $2.74 is 15% higher than last year. Now, let's cover three important areas; fee-related earnings, appreciation in our corporate private equity business, and capital return to shareholders. Starting with fee-related earnings. FRE increased to $278 million in the quarter, up more than 35% from the third quarter of 2023. We are on track to hit our 2024 FRE target of $1.1 billion, which would represent nearly 30% year-over-year growth. Pending fee-earning AUM stands at $21 billion, our highest level since the third quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we expect to activate fees on our latest Japan buyout fund. And in 2025, we'll activate fees on our new U.S. opportunistic real estate fund. Year-to-date capital market fees were more than 80% higher than a year ago. We will see a significant increase in Q4 capital market fees as several large transactions have already closed. We expect to see further growth over time as our focus on expanding our capabilities in this area should support a higher level of capital markets activity. Let's turn to fund appreciation. As Harvey noted, our corporate private equity fund appreciation was up significantly. Driving this performance in the U.S. was strong EBITDA growth, up 15% year-over-year and continued margin expansion across the portfolio. This positive underlying growth is driving significant value creation at the fund level, and our portfolio is well positioned to further benefit from a better exit environment. Net accrued performance revenues increased more than $600 million to $2.8 billion. As we noted, this represents almost $8 of pretax earnings per share for our shareholders. Finally, let me touch on capital allocation. We continue to balance deployment of capital into our business and returning capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $150 million of shares in the third quarter, bringing total repurchases to almost $480 million year-to-date. Total shares outstanding are down for the second consecutive year, and we have over $900 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to continue repurchasing shares. However, our first priority is investing for growth. Wrapping up, we continue to focus on delivering strong results for our shareholders. We are on track to achieve the financial targets that we laid out for 2024, and we have increasing conviction in the ability of our investment platform to drive higher earnings for shareholders over time. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nAlex Blostein: Hey good morning everybody. Hello Harvey, hello John.\nHarvey Schwartz: Morning Alex.\nAlex Blostein: So, maybe just to kick us off with a little bit of a macro question, obviously, related to the election, and I know you made a couple of comments in your opening remarks, but curious how you think the Trump administration could impact activity in the alt space, both on a macro set of activity side, but also any regulatory items you're paying particular attention to and how that could impact Carlyle? Thanks.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Alex. Well, maybe take a step back for a minute because obviously, the market had an unexpectedly strong reaction to the outcome. I think that has a lot to do with expectations, obviously going in. David was on TV yesterday, David Rubenstein, and he made a comment. He said something got the effect of the losers in this process were the posters. And he said, maybe we need to get AI involved in the polling process. And now taking that quite seriously, coming into this election, there were concerning headlines about the fact that we might not have a result for days, if not weeks, possibly months. That creates a lot of uncertainty in CEO's minds in how they think about strategy, how they think about committing capital, making decisions. And I think the election certainty and having the outcome behind was a obviously very significant relief factor for the market. Now, from a policy perspective, whether it's sustained or further cuts in the tax regime, whether it's a lighter regulatory touch, all these things will get translated in CEOs' minds, Boards or portfolio companies in really confidence around the operating environment, and that will lead to more decision-making. It should lead to more M&A activity. If you're not quite certain whether or not you can get your transaction done from a strategic perspective, obviously, that gives you a lot of pause as a Board. And so I think this is what the market is reacting to. Now, in terms of our business, we're already seeing lots of tailwinds in the business. You see it in the numbers today. A big part of that is the strategic actions the management team has taken. A big part of that is the market environment. And when we saw the stability of interest rates flattening out, I just think election certainty, future policies plus Fed policy normalizing. I think Fed policy normalizing and being past the election, that's a pretty powerful one-two punch for markets and for our business specifically at Carlyle.\nJohn Redett: And Alex, the only thing I would add is a little bit echoing what Harvey said. I spoke to a couple of our portfolio company CEOs yesterday. And I would just echo the common theme was they feel like the election certainty -- the removal of the election uncertainty will elevate confidence levels. And that obviously is -- that's good for capital markets, and that's good for M&A. And all those things being better, stronger, we think it's good for our business.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into performance. You called out and are having some nice exits, StandardAero, Rigaku, and it seems like there's more to come. At the same time, the net IRR in CP7 sort of remained at 8% despite the jump in accrued carry. And if you look at CP5, the IRR fell to 4%. How should we think about the performance metrics developing in buyout if and as you get the exits you expect in this improving environment? And I think we, the investment community, see performance in buyout as a headwind. Do you see that changing or have a different view, again, given the environment? And if so, is it big enough to change the fundraising trajectory?\nJohn Redett: Hey Ken, it's John. So, look, we saw a very strong improvement in performance within our corporate private equity business. And as Harvey alluded to, it was particularly in the U.S. and Asia. The performance fee accrual was up nearly $600 million -- $700 million in total. Corporate private equity drove the vast majority of that. It's one of the best quarters we've ever had. Look, the appreciation we're seeing in our U.S. and Asia funds is very healthy. What I like about it is a big driver of that is just operational improvements. We're seeing good EBITDA growth, good revenue growth, good margin expansion. And I think it reflects we're in a strong economy and better exit markets only add to that improved performance. And look, we've been very, very open on this topic in previous calls. We've been very focused as a leadership team on improving our performance in the private equity business. And I think when you look at the results this quarter, it's really -- the numbers are starting to reflect the focus we have on this business. We like the trajectory of this business, and we know this is a business that over time, we can grow. I think the performance improvement in the U.S. is particularly notable in CP7. You're not going to see the net IRR materially change as we're just getting through the catch-up phase, but you did see a 100 basis point pickup in 1 quarter on the gross IRR. I would say on CP8, our most recent vintage, I would focus on the gross IRR as that fund is not fully deployed. So the net IRR is a lot less relevant.\nKen Worthington: Okay, great. Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish from Barclays. Your question please.\nBen Budish: Hey good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your outlook for 2025 a little bit in terms of what you expect on the credit side. I think on the private equity side, you're kind of done with a lot of the major fundraises, and it sounds like you're expecting a big pickup in activity. Same with the solutions. As I recall, you should be mostly done kind of fundraising there by the end of this year. So, on the credit side, what's sort of your expectation for fundraising activity? What else are you kind of thinking about in terms of how to build, grow, develop that platform? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: So, across credit and insurance, the momentum is quite significant. And when I say that, I'm really talking about across the strategic part, opportunistic credit, but all the way through the capital stack, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, around asset-based finance. So, the private investment-grade market just continues to grow, and we're very well positioned with that, in part because of our partnership with Fortitude and all the insurance intelligence we have from that plus their excess capital position. So, I feel very optimistic about the credit markets. And we talked about the CLO activity. Spreads at this rate -- spreads at these levels, it's quite attractive. And so we expect activity to remain quite high.\nBen Budish: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your question please.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey good morning everyone. I think all the positives from the Trump win for the alts are fairly obvious, and you went through a lot of those. But curious if you guys have done any scenario testing of how the business and/or in-ground portfolio would fare through some of the more aggressive plans that you have like tariffs and/or mass deportations where the outcome is a little bit muddier for us? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: Well, on tariffs, obviously, as a firm, we've worked through tariffs before in the firm's history. And so you can be assured at the portfolio company level and at in the C-suite, we risk manage around any number of scenarios, not just around things like that. But this is going to have to be a wait and see in terms of how policy gets implemented. Where we benefit from is the diversity of the franchise, both across industry groups and also, obviously, geographically. But obviously, this is something that all industries will focus on as we move forward, but there are no unique issues for Carlyle. Thanks Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna from Citizens GMP. Your question please.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning all. So, it was great to see the significant step-up in net accrued performance fees in the quarter, which clearly has positive implications on future earnings over time. But with the vast majority of this ultimately moving to cash on the balance sheet once realized, how should we think about deploying this excess capital over time, specifically as it relates to organic growth, strategic M&A, as well as buybacks?\nJohn Redett: Yes, Brian, it's John. Thanks for the question. I mean, look, we think of capital allocation just more broadly of where we can get the best return. And there are a couple of levers, I think we have as a firm. One of them is a share buyback, which we've been very active on that front. The other one is investing in the businesses for organic growth. We're very focused on organic growth. That is our first priority. We talk about it all the time. And the other area is inorganic opportunities is another area where we can allocate capital. I would just say we look at a lot of stuff. Obviously, we get shown everything. Where we sit today, we think we can get the best returns for our shareholders, investing into our business for organic growth and continuing to do a share buyback. That said, if something came along inorganically that strategically made sense, financially made sense, we would be open to -- we wouldn't hesitate. But where we sit today, nothing is imminent. We're very focused on organic growth and continuing to buy back shares. Remember, we've done nearly $500 million year-to-date. We have $900 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we're just really balancing our objectives of returning capital to shareholder and focusing on organic growth.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello, thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey good morning Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Good morning. I think we'd all love to see the pickup in M&A and IPOs and better capital markets activity. And there's only -- the short-term downside maybe is less or no net asset growth if outflows are bigger than fundraising like you saw a little bit this quarter. So, when I look at the 2% growth in management fees year-on-year, I don't feel like it reflects what the real underlying growth is in what's going on in the momentum that you've highlighted. So, curious how we should think about, is there a path to double-digit management fee growth as you start to deploy all that dry powder that you have? Thanks.\nJohn Redett: Yes, Glenn hey, it's John. Look, we had fee revenue growth of 7% in the quarter. A lot of this was driven by our capital markets capabilities. Look, this has been a focus area for the management team, and we're very pleased with the progress we've made in terms of capital markets. And I think you need to take a step back and look at our capital markets in the sense, it's a balance sheet-light business. We really aren't taking balance sheet risk. And again, we're only focused on Carlyle-related capital markets activity. So, I think it's a little different than others in the industry. This business has grown 80% this year. We'll generate a record result this year. So we feel very good about our capital markets effort. And again, this has been a very deliberate focus area for the firm. In terms of management fees, we're seeing really strong management fee growth in solutions. It's up nearly 45%. We're seeing good management fee growth in credit. That grew nearly 11%. And look, as expected, we're still seeing some headwinds in our private equity business in terms of management fee growth, more on the corporate private equity side. We're in the market raising a real estate fund, and we're very optimistic on that outcome. And we've said in the past that fund will be larger than the previous fund. But in terms of corporate private equity, we've been very focused on the performance in this business. We really like the trajectory of this business. And we're confident that we can grow this business over time.\nHarvey Schwartz: I would just say, Glenn, I agree with your first statement. Sitting here, being in the seat now for a bit over year and a half, the momentum in the franchise is really just starting to translate into the top line, whether it's in wealth, credit, asset-based finance, the insurance strategy, credit solutions, and in private equity. So the momentum feels quite good.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Brown from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please.\nMike Brown: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So it seems like at this point, Harvey, year and a half plus into the job, the foundation is kind of in place and established at Carlyle. As you think about the next few years, what is the right way to think about the annual fundraising potential? Is this kind of $40 billion level what Carlyle can kind of deliver on an annual basis? And then also the FRE growth potential from here. I guess if you think about that kind of multiyear horizon, can Carlyle get to a point of delivering low double-digit FRE growth annually? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yeah. So year and a half in, I would say, the first principles really was just making sure we had all the right people in the right seats with the right capital strategy, the right expense methodology and, of course, the right leadership and I made a number of appointments, as you know, over that time period. Now, in terms of the future strategy, when you think about FRE growth you really have to look at these areas that are emerging quite powerfully. So capital markets, which John just said this, the quality of those revenues is exceptionally high because we're basically running a balance sheet light, risk less business and we see runway there. The wealth channel, the Carlyle brand resonating around the world, really hard to model that over the next several years. But we're at a point where we've really only launched our second solution, we'll launch our private equity solution last year -- I'm sorry, next year. But the momentum when I talk to advisers and you see it in the numbers this quarter, so there's momentum across the firm. In terms of fundraising, we put out this target this year of $40 billion, that was really just to give you some comfort with me being new in the seat. We'll think about how we communicate that over time. I think one of the things we did was we unfortunately left you with the feeling that that's going to be like a lockstep mathematical divided by 4, $10 billion every quarter. But I can tell you that, again, it's early days still at 18 months, but the momentum feels pretty extraordinary.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just, Harvey, if I can go back to the tariffs topic, just from a global trade perspective and deployment outside the U.S. How are you viewing that potential landscape? Do you see any frictions in deployment regionally? And are you thinking -- I guess, how are you thinking about deployment firm-wide between Europe and Japan? And any impact from the tariffs there?\nHarvey Schwartz: So again, on the tariffs, I think it's very difficult for any firm, any business, global or local, to try and anticipate government policy. And I actually think it would be, in my opinion, an advice mistake to be changing strategy. Now, you could prepare for any number of scenarios. And world-class management teams do that. In terms of our franchise, remember, we are global, but in many cases, very local. So if you look at our Asia business, we're one of the few that have a leading Japan franchise. Our Asia business spans Southeast Asia, India, China. And so we have these -- the benefit of being global with a very regional capability. I think that's an advantage. Now, I think that's an advantage in any environment. But again, I think you can have -- you can game-theory out various things, so you're more prepared. But I think expectations around tariffs, that's just something we're going to have to see. I think that where we can feel much more confident is around regulatory touch tax policy and all the things that will be really powerful elixirs for the market and for exits and for investing opportunities. But there will always be these elements of uncertainty on the periphery, but we'll see how they resolve over time.\nBrian Bedell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your question, please.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, Harvey. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my question.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey, Brennan.\nBrennan Hawken: Hey. So interested to talk about the fundraising point. It's and I might be reading too much into this, but it seems like now you're talking about 40, and the pace is in sort of like upper mid-20s year-to-date, so a little behind the pace of 40. Was the about 40 meant to -- meant as a softener around that number? And how should we be thinking about the fourth quarter? What are the drivers that will come through? And also just to confirm, did you close the Real Estate X Fund in the third quarter?\nJohn Redett: Brennan, it's John. I'll start with that, and Harvey, feel free to add. Look, I'll echo a little bit what Harvey said on fundraising. We feel very good about the momentum we have in fundraising across the franchise. You alluded to it, the number we're $26 billion year-to-date. That's the second-best year-to-date period we've ever had in our history. So I think we have a lot of momentum. We have pretty good visibility into the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter looks strong. So we'll get in and around 40. It's really hard to manage the business from a fundraising perspective to a specific number stuff. Stuff moves forward, stuff moves back. And I focus much more on it over a longer period of time. I think we'll get close to the 40, maybe we exceed it slightly, maybe we underachieve it slightly. But in terms of how we think about managing the business, it doesn't really matter because we look at it over a multi-quarter period. And quite frankly, we focus a little bit more on just the momentum we have across the franchise, whether that's in our asset-backed business. Whether it's in solutions, whether it's in real estate, and Harvey touched on this, we're seeing great momentum in the wealth channel. And we continue to think that will be a big component of fundraising going forward. So I guess, I'd answer it more in terms of we feel very good about the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter and next year.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yeah. I guess we really weren't trying to signal anything with the about. I think that there's things we have 100% control over or more control over like how we're driving FRE into the end of the year, where we can give you more certainty. If we have a handful of important clients who say, hey, we wanted to delay some decision-making for the election or whatever reason, we'd like you to extend some things, we -- look, we'll work with our clients. And so we don't manage fundraising for the purposes of hitting a number. We manage fundraising for the purpose of deployment running the business and really for our clients' needs. That's why you hear that. But if I gave you the impression at the beginning of the year that 40 was a hard number, but maybe I should have said either side of 40. So anyway -- but no, there's no big signaling here, other than the momentum feels great. Thanks.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for that clarity.\nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning, Harvey and John. And thanks for taking my questions. So I was hoping you could help frame the revenue opportunity in capital markets. With deal activity poised to accelerate, you noted you're seeing momentum across the franchise. Just trying to gauge how you think about an achievable run rate for this business and whether you're adequately resourced at least in relation to the opportunity that you envisage?\nHarvey Schwartz : So in terms of resourcing, yes, we feel completely well resourced. The changes we made last year, I forgot here were very specific around prioritization, focus, alignment incentives and that's why you're seeing the results you're seeing. Again, with Q4 activity, it's already a record for the firm and this is really against a, I think, a pretty quiet environment given what we may see. I think the strategic tipping point is at what point does this -- if it becomes more of a balance sheet intensive business for us? But we have a lot of runway before we get there. And so I think we have a lot of capacity. And deal activity will drive more activity. Giving you a runway is a little difficult because it's like saying, hey, can you forecast economic activity next year? But I can tell you all the pieces of the engine are in the proper place now.\nJohn Redett : Yes, Steve, I would just echo what Harvey said. We're going to have a record year across the platform in terms of capital markets revenue. And I would just repeat this was in a relatively quiet market. And as markets continue to improve, we are very comfortable that we think that number should continue to accelerate.\nSteven Chubak: Helpful color. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from TD Cowen. Your question please.\nBill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much and good morning to everybody. Just maybe a slightly different tack on FRE. You've done a very good job of enhancing the FRE margin as you mentioned, year-on-year, and if you look at the different segments it's up very strongly. What's the algorithm for next year as we look ahead? How much more incremental margin can you shoot for? And then just to have a secondary question. Just given the interplay between where you're growing assets, where you're realizing assets how do we think about the interplay between fee paying AUM growth versus the base management fee rate? Thank you.\nHarvey Schwartz : Well, before -- I'm going to have John come into some of those details. But before we do that, I want to just I want to take a victory lap for John and the whole management team, because in a period of several months last year, they completely structured the compensation methodology, introduced it, introduced expense-saving initiatives. And I think they've accomplished an incredible amount in a very short period of time. And really set the foundation for how to run the firm. Personally, I think there's more upside. But on some of the details, I'll turn it over to John. But he won't pat himself on the back, so -- or his team up, but I'll do that for him. John?\nJohn Redett : Yes, Bill, look, we feel very good about FRE. We had a record year. As I said in my remarks, we're clearly on path to hit $1.1 billion for the year. We have good visibility on the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with where the margin is. It's at 47%. Again, let's put this in perspective. This is 1,000 basis points higher than it was last year, probably 2,000 basis points higher than it was five years ago. So we've made tremendous progress. But look, the way the management team thinks about this business is we are much more focused on growth. And I would like to see the FRE margin grow via organic growth versus more efficiencies. I think there's -- we'll get a little bit from running the business efficiently, and we'll continue to run the business efficiently. But I think you could expect to see that margin improve as we grow over time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about asset-based finance, a meaningful growth opportunity for Carlyle. So hoping you could just update us on where that stands today just in terms of AUM, how that part of the business has been growing. And maybe talk about some of the steps you might take into '25 to accelerate growth of that platform. And to what extent might you look to expand platform capabilities here to best capture the opportunity set? Thank you.\nJohn Redett : Yes, it's John. Look, I think it's an enormous opportunity for the industry and for Carlyle. And I do think it will be a large driver of credit growth for us going forward. But I'd say, look, it's very early days in the ABS space. Again, I think this market is enormous. It's multiples of direct lending. We obviously announced the Discover transaction a couple of months ago. It was a very high-profile transaction for us. That transaction is largely closed post the third quarter. So we're very pleased with that. Look, this is a business we started from scratch organically a couple of years ago. We already have roughly $7 billion of AUM. The pipeline continues to be one of the stronger pipelines we see across the platform. And look, it's a mix of one-off portfolio purchases and flow arrangements. We have in place a handful of flow arrangements. I would expect that to continue to increase over time. But I think it will be a mix of kind of portfolio purchases and flow arrangements. A couple of the flow arrangements that we have that you've probably heard us talk about in the past are Monogram, Triad, Unison, covering multiple different assets, and we have others. And you should expect us going forward to have more flow arrangements or more flow partnerships as the business continues to evolve. But we really like this business. We're really pleased with where the business is, and we think this business has a lot of potential.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your question please.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning everyone. Hope you are all doing well.\nHarvey Schwartz : Hey, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Stock-based comp is now run-rating between 120 and 130 after the grants earlier this year. And I believe you commented on prior calls that there should be a step-down next year in 2025. However, I also believe the mechanics of the issuance is related to the price of the stock, which is higher today. So I just wanted your perspective on how we should be forecasting stock-based comp next year relative to where it came in this past quarter.\nJohn Redett : Hey, Craig, it's John. Good to hear from you. And I've said this on previous calls, a little bit of this is around the specific accounting treatment for the performance stock units. As you recall, from an accounting perspective, we are expensing them heavily upfront versus when they actually vest. And you've seen our stock-based comp at elevated levels the last few quarters. It's elevated today in the third quarter. It will continue to be at the third quarter level in the fourth quarter. But in 2025, we do expect to see that stock-based comp number trend down to more normalized levels.\nHarvey Schwartz : Again, this is the accounting phenomenon of the grants that we gave. One of the things that we strategically did obviously is announcing the share buyback in advance of those awards, which are much higher stock levels. We already bought back a significant portion of anything associated with that dilution. So that's why you're seeing these dilution numbers look so attractive, certainly relative to the all the years prior to John and I doing this. This is the first two years dilution hasn't been a negative.\nJohn Redett : Yes. I mean, Craig, the last two years, the share count is actually down. It's down 1% this year. And look, we're very focused on repurchasing shares.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Daniel Harris for any further remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Thank you all very much for your time and attention today. Should you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to Investor Relations after the call. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks Dan. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Over the past year and a half, we undertook several strategic actions to drive better performance, including realigning our compensation model, appointing new leadership, and prioritizing margin expansion among other initiatives. As we stand here today, you're beginning to see the early impacts of those steps. These actions, combined with a pickup in activity across the platform, generated one of the best quarterly performances in the firm's history. We delivered record quarterly fee-related earnings, up 36% versus the third quarter of 2023 and our best ever FRE margins at 47%, up more than 10 percentage points since last year. Overall, we are on track to hit our FRE target of $1.1 billion for the year. Our underlying investment portfolio is performing very well. This drove strong corporate private equity fund appreciation that fueled a nearly 30% increase in our net accrued performance revenues compared to the prior quarter. This accrual represents nearly $8 per share of future earnings for our shareholders. As we talked about previously, capital markets was a significantly underleveraged part of our platform that is gaining substantial momentum. This is the direct result of proactive steps we've taken to increase alignment around transaction fee generation. Including closed Q4 activity, we've already generated our highest level of annual transaction fees. This, despite a still subdued M&A and IPO environment. Obviously, we expect further growth in capital markets fees. On fundraising, we raised $9 billion of new capital in the quarter and have raised $43 billion over the past 12 months. We anticipate a very strong fourth quarter of capital raising to close out the year, and we continue to target about $40 billion of inflows for the year. Now switching to the macro environment. Obviously, let's start with the election results. Being past the election has removed market uncertainty, first and foremost. Markets like certainty and you're seeing that broadly across capital markets, particularly in the stock market yesterday. Over the medium to long-term, this should be a further catalyst for IPOs, M&A, and key sectors we invest in. This should be an environment in which we are well positioned to capitalize on monetization opportunities and put capital to work. Prior to election, we had already seen the U.S. Federal Reserve shift in stance on interest rates and that was a clear sign that we entered a new era of monetary policy and that inflation has stabilized. The election certainty and the change in monetary policy are a powerful combination supporting economic growth and our business. We're already seeing a significant uptick in IPO activity this year. There's been a 30% increase in listings and a 50% increase in IPO proceeds in the first nine months of this year. We've seen this trend benefit our portfolio as well with two significant IPOs in just the last month, StandardAero in the U.S. and Rigaku in Japan. StandardAero marked the second largest sponsor-backed U.S. IPO of the year and the best first-day performance for U.S. IPO, raising over $1 billion, this since 2021. Aerospace, defense, and government services is a key power alley for Carlyle. Our roots in D.C. and more than 30-year history in this space is a core differentiator for us. This was the largest aerospace IPO ever and demonstrates that the market is starved for high-quality businesses and growth outside of the tech sector. Rigaku is the second biggest Japanese IPO this year and the largest ever sponsored-backed IPO in Japan. Japan remains a very attractive market for us. This year's improved market sentiment has driven stronger investment activity and a more active pipeline across our platform, reflecting our ability to act on opportunities in a dynamic environment. A more liquid realization backdrop and strong underlying portfolio performance have supported higher investment returns. Our two largest U.S. buyout funds were up north of 7% each this quarter, and our two largest Asia buyout funds were up 9% and 13%, respectively. This quarter represented the third largest quarterly increase in net accrued performance revenues in our firm's history. Over $600 million of net performance revenues were generated. Switching to Global Wealth, another area of strategic focus, we're seeing strong momentum across the platform, where we benefited from a record $1.8 billion of wealth inflows. Our wealth inflows this quarter were nearly 3 times the amount in the previous quarter, and our global wealth AUM is up 70% year-over-year. Part of the momentum is our newly launched secondaries wealth solution, CAPM, which is seeing very strong early traction with advisers and their clients. We're also making progress in our private equity wealth product and are still on track to launch in 2025. Another area where we see accelerating growth is in asset-backed finance. We continue to identify differentiated partnerships with specialty finance companies to further bolster our origination capabilities and give us a data edge in the market. We've also seen record leveraged loan and CLO issuance in 2024. Loan spreads have tightened to post-GFC levels and demand for new paper is outpacing supply. Full year 2024 U.S. leveraged loan issuance is expected to exceed $1 trillion for only the third time. At Carlyle, the team has been very busy with our leading CLO business having priced 22 transactions globally on track to be a record year of resets and transactions priced. The opportunities in our insurance business remain quite significant. Fortitude has grown its general account assets by almost 70% in the past year. It has increased its excess capital position to more than $1 billion, allowing us to pursue a robust reinsurance pipeline. We also continue to grow our relationships with insurance clients broadly and further leverage our private investment-grade and asset-backed finance capabilities in this important channel. To wrap things up, we had a strong third quartile with Carlyle extremely well positioned to capitalize on an improving macroeconomic environment. Our leadership team remains laser-focused on driving performance and accelerating growth to drive long-term value for you, our shareholders. With that, let me now turn the call over to John. Morning Alex. Thanks Alex. Well, maybe take a step back for a minute because obviously, the market had an unexpectedly strong reaction to the outcome. I think that has a lot to do with expectations, obviously going in. David was on TV yesterday, David Rubenstein, and he made a comment. He said something got the effect of the losers in this process were the posters. And he said, maybe we need to get AI involved in the polling process. And now taking that quite seriously, coming into this election, there were concerning headlines about the fact that we might not have a result for days, if not weeks, possibly months. That creates a lot of uncertainty in CEO's minds in how they think about strategy, how they think about committing capital, making decisions. And I think the election certainty and having the outcome behind was a obviously very significant relief factor for the market. Now, from a policy perspective, whether it's sustained or further cuts in the tax regime, whether it's a lighter regulatory touch, all these things will get translated in CEOs' minds, Boards or portfolio companies in really confidence around the operating environment, and that will lead to more decision-making. It should lead to more M&A activity. If you're not quite certain whether or not you can get your transaction done from a strategic perspective, obviously, that gives you a lot of pause as a Board. And so I think this is what the market is reacting to. Now, in terms of our business, we're already seeing lots of tailwinds in the business. You see it in the numbers today. A big part of that is the strategic actions the management team has taken. A big part of that is the market environment. And when we saw the stability of interest rates flattening out, I just think election certainty, future policies plus Fed policy normalizing. I think Fed policy normalizing and being past the election, that's a pretty powerful one-two punch for markets and for our business specifically at Carlyle. Thanks Ken. So, across credit and insurance, the momentum is quite significant. And when I say that, I'm really talking about across the strategic part, opportunistic credit, but all the way through the capital stack, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, around asset-based finance. So, the private investment-grade market just continues to grow, and we're very well positioned with that, in part because of our partnership with Fortitude and all the insurance intelligence we have from that plus their excess capital position. So, I feel very optimistic about the credit markets. And we talked about the CLO activity. Spreads at this rate -- spreads at these levels, it's quite attractive. And so we expect activity to remain quite high. Well, on tariffs, obviously, as a firm, we've worked through tariffs before in the firm's history. And so you can be assured at the portfolio company level and at in the C-suite, we risk manage around any number of scenarios, not just around things like that. But this is going to have to be a wait and see in terms of how policy gets implemented. Where we benefit from is the diversity of the franchise, both across industry groups and also, obviously, geographically. But obviously, this is something that all industries will focus on as we move forward, but there are no unique issues for Carlyle. Thanks Patrick. Hey good morning Glenn. I would just say, Glenn, I agree with your first statement. Sitting here, being in the seat now for a bit over year and a half, the momentum in the franchise is really just starting to translate into the top line, whether it's in wealth, credit, asset-based finance, the insurance strategy, credit solutions, and in private equity. So the momentum feels quite good. Yeah. So year and a half in, I would say, the first principles really was just making sure we had all the right people in the right seats with the right capital strategy, the right expense methodology and, of course, the right leadership and I made a number of appointments, as you know, over that time period. Now, in terms of the future strategy, when you think about FRE growth you really have to look at these areas that are emerging quite powerfully. So capital markets, which John just said this, the quality of those revenues is exceptionally high because we're basically running a balance sheet light, risk less business and we see runway there. The wealth channel, the Carlyle brand resonating around the world, really hard to model that over the next several years. But we're at a point where we've really only launched our second solution, we'll launch our private equity solution last year -- I'm sorry, next year. But the momentum when I talk to advisers and you see it in the numbers this quarter, so there's momentum across the firm. In terms of fundraising, we put out this target this year of $40 billion, that was really just to give you some comfort with me being new in the seat. We'll think about how we communicate that over time. I think one of the things we did was we unfortunately left you with the feeling that that's going to be like a lockstep mathematical divided by 4, $10 billion every quarter. But I can tell you that, again, it's early days still at 18 months, but the momentum feels pretty extraordinary. So again, on the tariffs, I think it's very difficult for any firm, any business, global or local, to try and anticipate government policy. And I actually think it would be, in my opinion, an advice mistake to be changing strategy. Now, you could prepare for any number of scenarios. And world-class management teams do that. In terms of our franchise, remember, we are global, but in many cases, very local. So if you look at our Asia business, we're one of the few that have a leading Japan franchise. Our Asia business spans Southeast Asia, India, China. And so we have these -- the benefit of being global with a very regional capability. I think that's an advantage. Now, I think that's an advantage in any environment. But again, I think you can have -- you can game-theory out various things, so you're more prepared. But I think expectations around tariffs, that's just something we're going to have to see. I think that where we can feel much more confident is around regulatory touch tax policy and all the things that will be really powerful elixirs for the market and for exits and for investing opportunities. But there will always be these elements of uncertainty on the periphery, but we'll see how they resolve over time. Hey, Brennan. Yeah. I guess we really weren't trying to signal anything with the about. I think that there's things we have 100% control over or more control over like how we're driving FRE into the end of the year, where we can give you more certainty. If we have a handful of important clients who say, hey, we wanted to delay some decision-making for the election or whatever reason, we'd like you to extend some things, we -- look, we'll work with our clients. And so we don't manage fundraising for the purposes of hitting a number. We manage fundraising for the purpose of deployment running the business and really for our clients' needs. That's why you hear that. But if I gave you the impression at the beginning of the year that 40 was a hard number, but maybe I should have said either side of 40. So anyway -- but no, there's no big signaling here, other than the momentum feels great. Thanks. Thanks. So in terms of resourcing, yes, we feel completely well resourced. The changes we made last year, I forgot here were very specific around prioritization, focus, alignment incentives and that's why you're seeing the results you're seeing. Again, with Q4 activity, it's already a record for the firm and this is really against a, I think, a pretty quiet environment given what we may see. I think the strategic tipping point is at what point does this -- if it becomes more of a balance sheet intensive business for us? But we have a lot of runway before we get there. And so I think we have a lot of capacity. And deal activity will drive more activity. Giving you a runway is a little difficult because it's like saying, hey, can you forecast economic activity next year? But I can tell you all the pieces of the engine are in the proper place now. Well, before -- I'm going to have John come into some of those details. But before we do that, I want to just I want to take a victory lap for John and the whole management team, because in a period of several months last year, they completely structured the compensation methodology, introduced it, introduced expense-saving initiatives. And I think they've accomplished an incredible amount in a very short period of time. And really set the foundation for how to run the firm. Personally, I think there's more upside. But on some of the details, I'll turn it over to John. But he won't pat himself on the back, so -- or his team up, but I'll do that for him. John? Hey, Craig. Again, this is the accounting phenomenon of the grants that we gave. One of the things that we strategically did obviously is announcing the share buyback in advance of those awards, which are much higher stock levels. We already bought back a significant portion of anything associated with that dilution. So that's why you're seeing these dilution numbers look so attractive, certainly relative to the all the years prior to John and I doing this. This is the first two years dilution hasn't been a negative."

            "name": "John Redett",
            "content": "Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the progress we've made over the last year. The business is just performing much better than it was 12 months ago, and we are also benefiting from a material step-up in market activity. The actions we've taken over the past year include improving FRE margins, activating the capital markets flywheel, improving investment performance, realigning our compensation strategy, appointing new leadership, and we continue to see benefits of the revised capital allocation strategy we implemented this year. These actions have generated significant operating leverage and momentum across our business, including record AUM of $447 billion, up 17% compared to last year; record fee-earning AUM of $314 billion, which has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last five years; record quarterly FRE of $278 million at a 47% FRE margin; and strong performance in our corporate private equity funds, which drove a material shift higher in net accrued performance revenues to $2.8 billion. We produced $367 million in DE for the quarter or $0.95 in DE per share. And year-to-date DE per share of $2.74 is 15% higher than last year. Now, let's cover three important areas; fee-related earnings, appreciation in our corporate private equity business, and capital return to shareholders. Starting with fee-related earnings. FRE increased to $278 million in the quarter, up more than 35% from the third quarter of 2023. We are on track to hit our 2024 FRE target of $1.1 billion, which would represent nearly 30% year-over-year growth. Pending fee-earning AUM stands at $21 billion, our highest level since the third quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we expect to activate fees on our latest Japan buyout fund. And in 2025, we'll activate fees on our new U.S. opportunistic real estate fund. Year-to-date capital market fees were more than 80% higher than a year ago. We will see a significant increase in Q4 capital market fees as several large transactions have already closed. We expect to see further growth over time as our focus on expanding our capabilities in this area should support a higher level of capital markets activity. Let's turn to fund appreciation. As Harvey noted, our corporate private equity fund appreciation was up significantly. Driving this performance in the U.S. was strong EBITDA growth, up 15% year-over-year and continued margin expansion across the portfolio. This positive underlying growth is driving significant value creation at the fund level, and our portfolio is well positioned to further benefit from a better exit environment. Net accrued performance revenues increased more than $600 million to $2.8 billion. As we noted, this represents almost $8 of pretax earnings per share for our shareholders. Finally, let me touch on capital allocation. We continue to balance deployment of capital into our business and returning capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $150 million of shares in the third quarter, bringing total repurchases to almost $480 million year-to-date. Total shares outstanding are down for the second consecutive year, and we have over $900 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to continue repurchasing shares. However, our first priority is investing for growth. Wrapping up, we continue to focus on delivering strong results for our shareholders. We are on track to achieve the financial targets that we laid out for 2024, and we have increasing conviction in the ability of our investment platform to drive higher earnings for shareholders over time. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. And Alex, the only thing I would add is a little bit echoing what Harvey said. I spoke to a couple of our portfolio company CEOs yesterday. And I would just echo the common theme was they feel like the election certainty -- the removal of the election uncertainty will elevate confidence levels. And that obviously is -- that's good for capital markets, and that's good for M&A. And all those things being better, stronger, we think it's good for our business. Hey Ken, it's John. So, look, we saw a very strong improvement in performance within our corporate private equity business. And as Harvey alluded to, it was particularly in the U.S. and Asia. The performance fee accrual was up nearly $600 million -- $700 million in total. Corporate private equity drove the vast majority of that. It's one of the best quarters we've ever had. Look, the appreciation we're seeing in our U.S. and Asia funds is very healthy. What I like about it is a big driver of that is just operational improvements. We're seeing good EBITDA growth, good revenue growth, good margin expansion. And I think it reflects we're in a strong economy and better exit markets only add to that improved performance. And look, we've been very, very open on this topic in previous calls. We've been very focused as a leadership team on improving our performance in the private equity business. And I think when you look at the results this quarter, it's really -- the numbers are starting to reflect the focus we have on this business. We like the trajectory of this business, and we know this is a business that over time, we can grow. I think the performance improvement in the U.S. is particularly notable in CP7. You're not going to see the net IRR materially change as we're just getting through the catch-up phase, but you did see a 100 basis point pickup in 1 quarter on the gross IRR. I would say on CP8, our most recent vintage, I would focus on the gross IRR as that fund is not fully deployed. So the net IRR is a lot less relevant. Yes, Brian, it's John. Thanks for the question. I mean, look, we think of capital allocation just more broadly of where we can get the best return. And there are a couple of levers, I think we have as a firm. One of them is a share buyback, which we've been very active on that front. The other one is investing in the businesses for organic growth. We're very focused on organic growth. That is our first priority. We talk about it all the time. And the other area is inorganic opportunities is another area where we can allocate capital. I would just say we look at a lot of stuff. Obviously, we get shown everything. Where we sit today, we think we can get the best returns for our shareholders, investing into our business for organic growth and continuing to do a share buyback. That said, if something came along inorganically that strategically made sense, financially made sense, we would be open to -- we wouldn't hesitate. But where we sit today, nothing is imminent. We're very focused on organic growth and continuing to buy back shares. Remember, we've done nearly $500 million year-to-date. We have $900 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we're just really balancing our objectives of returning capital to shareholder and focusing on organic growth. Yes, Glenn hey, it's John. Look, we had fee revenue growth of 7% in the quarter. A lot of this was driven by our capital markets capabilities. Look, this has been a focus area for the management team, and we're very pleased with the progress we've made in terms of capital markets. And I think you need to take a step back and look at our capital markets in the sense, it's a balance sheet-light business. We really aren't taking balance sheet risk. And again, we're only focused on Carlyle-related capital markets activity. So, I think it's a little different than others in the industry. This business has grown 80% this year. We'll generate a record result this year. So we feel very good about our capital markets effort. And again, this has been a very deliberate focus area for the firm. In terms of management fees, we're seeing really strong management fee growth in solutions. It's up nearly 45%. We're seeing good management fee growth in credit. That grew nearly 11%. And look, as expected, we're still seeing some headwinds in our private equity business in terms of management fee growth, more on the corporate private equity side. We're in the market raising a real estate fund, and we're very optimistic on that outcome. And we've said in the past that fund will be larger than the previous fund. But in terms of corporate private equity, we've been very focused on the performance in this business. We really like the trajectory of this business. And we're confident that we can grow this business over time. Brennan, it's John. I'll start with that, and Harvey, feel free to add. Look, I'll echo a little bit what Harvey said on fundraising. We feel very good about the momentum we have in fundraising across the franchise. You alluded to it, the number we're $26 billion year-to-date. That's the second-best year-to-date period we've ever had in our history. So I think we have a lot of momentum. We have pretty good visibility into the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter looks strong. So we'll get in and around 40. It's really hard to manage the business from a fundraising perspective to a specific number stuff. Stuff moves forward, stuff moves back. And I focus much more on it over a longer period of time. I think we'll get close to the 40, maybe we exceed it slightly, maybe we underachieve it slightly. But in terms of how we think about managing the business, it doesn't really matter because we look at it over a multi-quarter period. And quite frankly, we focus a little bit more on just the momentum we have across the franchise, whether that's in our asset-backed business. Whether it's in solutions, whether it's in real estate, and Harvey touched on this, we're seeing great momentum in the wealth channel. And we continue to think that will be a big component of fundraising going forward. So I guess, I'd answer it more in terms of we feel very good about the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter and next year. Yes, Steve, I would just echo what Harvey said. We're going to have a record year across the platform in terms of capital markets revenue. And I would just repeat this was in a relatively quiet market. And as markets continue to improve, we are very comfortable that we think that number should continue to accelerate. Yes, Bill, look, we feel very good about FRE. We had a record year. As I said in my remarks, we're clearly on path to hit $1.1 billion for the year. We have good visibility on the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with where the margin is. It's at 47%. Again, let's put this in perspective. This is 1,000 basis points higher than it was last year, probably 2,000 basis points higher than it was five years ago. So we've made tremendous progress. But look, the way the management team thinks about this business is we are much more focused on growth. And I would like to see the FRE margin grow via organic growth versus more efficiencies. I think there's -- we'll get a little bit from running the business efficiently, and we'll continue to run the business efficiently. But I think you could expect to see that margin improve as we grow over time. Yes, it's John. Look, I think it's an enormous opportunity for the industry and for Carlyle. And I do think it will be a large driver of credit growth for us going forward. But I'd say, look, it's very early days in the ABS space. Again, I think this market is enormous. It's multiples of direct lending. We obviously announced the Discover transaction a couple of months ago. It was a very high-profile transaction for us. That transaction is largely closed post the third quarter. So we're very pleased with that. Look, this is a business we started from scratch organically a couple of years ago. We already have roughly $7 billion of AUM. The pipeline continues to be one of the stronger pipelines we see across the platform. And look, it's a mix of one-off portfolio purchases and flow arrangements. We have in place a handful of flow arrangements. I would expect that to continue to increase over time. But I think it will be a mix of kind of portfolio purchases and flow arrangements. A couple of the flow arrangements that we have that you've probably heard us talk about in the past are Monogram, Triad, Unison, covering multiple different assets, and we have others. And you should expect us going forward to have more flow arrangements or more flow partnerships as the business continues to evolve. But we really like this business. We're really pleased with where the business is, and we think this business has a lot of potential. Hey, Craig, it's John. Good to hear from you. And I've said this on previous calls, a little bit of this is around the specific accounting treatment for the performance stock units. As you recall, from an accounting perspective, we are expensing them heavily upfront versus when they actually vest. And you've seen our stock-based comp at elevated levels the last few quarters. It's elevated today in the third quarter. It will continue to be at the third quarter level in the fourth quarter. But in 2025, we do expect to see that stock-based comp number trend down to more normalized levels. Yes. I mean, Craig, the last two years, the share count is actually down. It's down 1% this year. And look, we're very focused on repurchasing shares."

The first half of '24 reflects strong momentum across our business. And as you can see when you look at it, this momentum truly clear in our results. For the first six months, we generated record FRE, record FRE margins, record assets under management and strong fundraising. Let me take a moment to talk about the current market activity. Obviously, we've all seen over the last few trading days and this morning, the market remains quite volatile. From our perspective, it's important to take a big step back. When we look at our proprietary portfolio data, this is what we see. The trajectory for GDP, the expected Fed rate cuts this year, all the dynamics still tell us the underlying fundamentals support improving activity across our platform for the balance of the year. Now consistent with that, we've announced two large recent transactions and have others in the pipeline we expect to finalize soon. In asset-backed finance, we announced a landmark $10 billion transaction to acquire portfolio of loans from Discover Financial Services. This transaction is a great example of the intersection of our asset-backed finance capabilities, our credit and insurance businesses and our capital markets expertise all coming together to drive value for our clients and generate transaction fees. As we've discussed, asset-backed finance is a critical provider of capital for the financial sector. There is a significant opportunity here to grow as we're in the early innings of a multitrillion dollar market opportunity, which we're well positioned for. On exits, we have a considerable pipeline of active IPO and sale processes underway. You just saw today, we announced the sale of our portfolio company, Cogentrix Energy, a leading power producer and the assets it manages at a valuation of nearly $3 billion. We expect exit activity in the second half of the year likely to be materially higher than the first half with several large transactions in our pipeline. Moving to fundraising. We raised $18 billion year-to-date and north of $40 billion over the last 12 months. We closed our fifth Japan buyout fund, saw strong inflows into our US real estate business and raised $5 billion in credit this quarter alone. This was our third best fundraising quarter on record for the credit business. And importantly, we're working towards our target of $40 billion for 2024. Let me just quickly run you through some specific areas of activity across our business. I'm quite optimistic about where our business is today compared to a year ago. As I said, there's a lot of momentum across the franchise. In Global Credit, we're well positioned to capitalize industry tailwinds and capture market share. In addition to the Discover Financial Services transaction, we saw strong activity in opportunistic and real asset credit strategies. In our CLO business, we remain very active. The first six months of the year were the second busiest in our 20-year CLO history. We ended Q2 as the world's largest CLO manager and we feel quite good about the forward pipeline. Finally, in Global Investment Solutions, the activity levels remain quite high as we address the investment needs of our clients. We deployed $9 billion and raised $12 million over the last 12 months and continue to see attractive opportunities across secondaries and co-investments. In Global Wealth, our brand continues to resonate with our wealth adviser partners. CTAC, our private credit product, had a strong first half. And CAPM, our solutions wealth product, has significant momentum and has been added to several new wealth distribution platforms. To wrap things up, our results this quarter reflect strong momentum across the firm as the environment continues to improve, which we believe it will, despite, as I said, recent market activity, Carlyle and our stakeholders are well positioned to benefit. With that, let me now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Redett: Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see significant momentum across our platform and remain on track to achieve our 2024 financial targets. We achieved record AUM of $435 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. We also produced another quarter of record FRE and FRE margins remain strong. We produced $343 million in DE for the second quarter or $0.78 in DE per share. And year-to-date, DE per share of $1.79 is 19% higher. We repurchased 178 million of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total repurchase amount to approximately 330 million for the first half of the year. Total shares outstanding are at the lowest level since 2021 and we have 1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now let's cover three important areas. Fee-related earnings, fundraising and the investment environment. Fee-related earnings increased to $273 million in the quarter, up over 30% from the second quarter of 2023. First half FRE of $539 million is far and away a record and is 35% higher than the first half of 2023. Second quarter management fees increased 2% in the quarter to $525 million. Management fees in Global Credit and Solutions experienced double-digit growth year-over-year and hit record levels. We expect total management fees to accelerate across the second half of the year driven by the nearly $20 billion of pending fee-earning AUM, the highest level since 2021. Transaction and advisory fees were up almost 60% year-over-year driven by the steadily improving transaction environment. We are on pace for a record year. We continue to drive towards our target of $1.1 billion of FRE for 2024, implying FRE in the second half of 2024 will be higher than the first half. Let's turn to fundraising. Year-to-date, we raised $18 billion in new capital and $41 billion over the last 12 months. We saw meaningful activity in this quarter in both Global Private Equity and Global Credit. In Global Private Equity, we closed our fifth vintage Japan buyout fund, nearly 70% larger than its predecessor. Across Asia, this brings us to $5 billion of capital raised. We recently announced the take private of KFC Japan, where our pan-Asia teams came together to leverage our significant expertise in the restaurant and food sector. This remains a robust market for us. In terms of our latest real estate fund, we closed on amount materially higher than what we disclosed in our earnings release and we are progressing quickly to a final close. In a challenging real estate market, it's worth noting the exceptional performance of our franchise, which remains a key area of growth. In Global Credit, we raised $5 billion in the quarter. As Harvey said, we had one of the most active first six months in our 20-plus year CLO history. We also benefited from continued strength in our credit wealth product, CTAC, as well as other strategies. For the balance of the year, we expect to raise significant capital across all segments as we continue to work towards our target of $40 billion. Finally, let me touch on the investment environment. As Harvey mentioned, we are seeing increased investment activity across the business as buyer and seller confidence has improved despite recent volatility. We have access to great proprietary data across our global platform, which also points to increased activity levels. In terms of exit activity, we now are seeing more robust competition where an IPO is a real exit path and strategic buyer interest has picked up. We expect increased activity in the second half of 2024. Wrapping up, we continue to focus on delivering strong results for our shareholders. We have good momentum across our platform and are on track to achieve the financial targets that we laid out for 2024. With that let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you very much. Okay, so --\nHarvey Schwartz: Good morning, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Good morning. I heard both of your comments loud and clear about your exit pipeline, DE guide and the backdrop. And the brokers and advisers that have reported have all said similar commentary. The market sentiment and the outlook is -- feels like it's changed a lot in the last few days. And so I'm curious a) why you think the market's perception is that things are going to slow down materially, but that's different for your business mix I get it. So I'd love to hear that. And b) just how that -- how all that business goes into your thoughts on capital-raising outlook for PE specifically?\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes. So Glenn, again, thanks for the question. So obviously, the last couple of days of trading and the way the markets are positioned to open this morning, there's a lot of red on the screens. When we form our views as John and I said, we look at underlying portfolio performance and we extrapolate that data in terms of economic growth. If we were having this call last Tuesday, none of these questions would be in the mix about the current market environment. As a matter of fact, you might think we were understating the trajectory of how things felt. And so I think all of us have to be a little bit careful not to overreact to a market adjustment, which at the moment feels very, very liquidity-driven and very risk sentiment-driven. Again, if we're having this call last week, we were talking about the fact that we expected Fed rate cuts, GDP looks solid. So none of that has changed our view. Now sentiment can extend itself into problematic ways. It's way too early to extrapolate that. Portfolio performance looks good. Market opportunity feels good. Exits still feel good. Pending announcements feel good. We'll see what happens over the next several weeks in terms of market environment. But if anything, I think, this will encourage the Fed to take action, which is really what the market is looking for. And again, we ought to be reminded, one of the things we learned over the last couple of years is how the transmission mechanism when the Fed is raising rates is slower than when they're cutting. And again, my crystal ball is no better than yours, Glenn, but nothing about the last couple of days changes our view about the balance of the year at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question as well.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hey, Alex.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, Harvey. So maybe just to build on the $40 billion target for fundraising for the year and your sort of confidence level around working towards that remaining $20 billion plus in the back half of the year, maybe talk a little bit about the key contributors you expect to come through, particularly around real estate, where it seems like you guys are seeing a really nice momentum. And maybe just clarify how much capital have you guys raised in those real estate funds and where they stand today. Thanks.\nJohn Redett: Hey, Alex, it's John. Look, we feel very good about the momentum we have in fundraising. We obviously had a very strong quarter in the second quarter. We're at $18 billion year-to-date. As I said in my remarks, we're at $41 billion in the last 12 months. So we do feel like we're working to the $40 billion. And as I look at kind of the next six months, it's really across the platform where we're raising money. We have a lot of product strategies in the market. I think you'll see continued momentum in our Solutions business, both the secondaries, the co-investment fund. As Harvey said, the CAPM wealth product is on more platforms. So we feel good about that. In terms of our credit business, we're seeing good momentum in our wealth product there, CTAC. You'll continue to see strength in our credit opportunities fund, our infra credit fund, and CLO activity will continue. And then when I look at kind of Global Private Equity, you'll see continued strength in our real estate fundraise. As I said earlier, we have a lot of momentum. We're at a number that's materially higher than we disclosed. And later in the year, we'll be launching infrastructure product as well and we have two buyout funds in the market. So we have a lot of strategies in the market in the back half and we feel really -- we're quite positive on the momentum we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about the outlook for fundraising in CEP VI and CAP VI? I think both have been similarly sized funds and recent vintages. Do you see fundraising as easier or more challenged for the next vintage in either Europe or Asian for those buyout-focused funds? And then for CAP VI, you raised $2 billion. How much longer is that fund in market? Any comments you can make on the outlook here?\nJohn Redett: Hey, Ken, it's John. Look, I'm limited in terms of what I can say specifically about CAP VI because we are in the market raising money. And we've been pretty clear previously stating that we do think the current fund CAP VI will be smaller than its predecessor fund and we've said that as well for CEP. Look, our CAP business it's really facing some geopolitical headwinds. But look, overall, in terms of Asia, as I said, we've raised $5 billion. We continue to see very attractive opportunities in Asia. I referenced the KFC transaction, which was a kind of a pan-Asia effort. But this is -- our Asia business is a very important business to us, and we're fully committed to it. As to where we end up in CAP VI, I can't really provide you a number.\nKenneth Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJohn Redett: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your transaction advisory fees. You identified this last year as a strategic area of focus. But based on your comments, it sounds like there's a lot more activity coming in the back half of the year. Just any color on how that line item should evolve in the back half and going into 2025 would be very helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Redett: Yes. This is John. Look, this has been a focus area for the firm the last 12 months. Harvey has been very clear that the firm is focused on this particular part of our business. I would say we're very pleased with the progress we've made. When you look at how the growth we're generating in this business over the last six months, it's quite impressive. It's up 60%. And obviously, it's benefiting from a more conducive transaction environment. And we kind of looking at the pipeline of exits as well as new transactions really across the platform, not just specific to private equity. We feel like this will be a record year for our kind of transaction capital market fees.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the deployment outlook for the second half. If you could talk a little bit about the timing of the, I think, nearly $20 billion of fee pending AUM in terms of that potential build for management fees? And then just in the light of the environment, if this risk-off sentiment persists in the second half, how do you envision that impacting your deployment outlook potential in the US and also Japan, I guess, as well?\nJohn Redett: Yes, Brian, it's John. Look, as Harvey said in this call, we're long-term investors, not to focus on day-to-day market volatility or market generations. But look, if we're in extend period of a down market, I can't -- I don't know what happens, but I think it's probably less positive than where we sit today. But looking at the pipeline today, we see tremendous transaction activity in the back half. So we feel very good about that. And it's really again, as I said earlier, it's not only private equity. It's in credit and it's in solutions. I mean if you look at the deployment levels we've had in our Solutions business, it's quite strong. We're at $4.5 billion year-to-date, and they have a very good pipeline. So I'd say it's broad-based. I don't -- I'm not smart enough to tell you where the markets are going to be. But where we sit today, we feel very good about the deployment. In terms of the $20 billion of pending fee earning AUM, which is really the highest level it's been since 2021, and there's some Global Private Equity AUM in that number and there's also some credit. You should expect that to be turned on over the coming quarters. So in Global Private Equity, we have Japan buyout in there. We have real estate. And in Global Credit, it's really spread across the platform. But you should assume those fees turn on over the coming quarters.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. It looks like you're now already in the kind of 30% to 35% FRE comp ratio range which I think happened a bit faster than most of us were expecting, particularly with realization is still so light. So firstly, can we expect this to be a new baseline from here? Or could it ratchet back up later in the year if say realizations stay this light? Thank you.\nJohn Redett: Yes, Patrick, it's John. Yes, look, we're very pleased with where we are on that ratio. But I have to be honest, we're not managing the business to hit that specific ratio. And we've always said we're going to operate within the range we specified in our fourth quarter. You should expect us to operate in that range but plus or minus 1% or 2% from kind of where we are, which is the midpoint or at the upper end of that range at 35% is where you should expect us to operate the business. Look, we're very mindful of investing in the business for growth, not necessarily completely focused on driving the margin, but more focused on investing in these businesses for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with Citizens JMP. Your line is now open.\nBrian Mckenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So we saw the announcement this morning that you're merging two of your BDCs. Can you just talk about the merits of the transaction? Why is now the right time for this? Are there any financial implications for CG? And then it will be great just to get an update on your broader direct lending strategy, specifically as it relates to both institutional and private wealth fundraising there?\nJohn Redett: Yes. So we announced the merger of our public BDCs merging with a private BDC, and we'll provide more details over time. And it likely won't close, Brian, until Q1 2025. But look the benefit to us is we get more scale in the public BDC. It is a scale business. I think it will be easier for us to raise equity capital going forward. That's obviously financially attractive to the firm. But also there is a benefit to FRE with this merger and we'll quantify that as we get closer to the close. But it's net-net, it's a positive for Carlyle.\nBrian Mckenna: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Within Global Private Equity, management fees were slightly up quarter-over-quarter, but obviously still down year-over-year and given the fundraising you talked about some of the dry powder. I guess as you look at the second half of the year and prospectively, what is your outlook for kind of management fees within just the global PE bucket?\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes. So Global Private Equity, we kind of are expecting flattish, Dan, in terms of management fees. Obviously, we're showing some real strength in the real estate side of the business. But as I said in the previous question, we do expect a couple of vintages of our private equity funds, our Europe buyout fund and Asia buyout fund to be smaller than predecessors. But we're able to mitigate that with the growth we're seeing in the real estate business and other parts of the Global Private Equity business.\nDaniel Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning.\nHarvey Schwartz: Good morning, Steven.\nSteven Chubak: So, how are you doing Harvey? So wanted to just ask for a mark-to-market on some of the progress you're making in the retail channel. You cited some improved momentum. I was just hoping to drill down further. How did flows trend in the quarter? And maybe more specifically how are you designing your retail-focused PE product just to be more competitive with some of the peer offerings that are out there that have seen some pretty good uptake?\nHarvey Schwartz: So I've been spending a lot of time in this space. Just to give you some color, we launched the CAPM, which John mentioned on, a number of platforms in the past quarter. David Rubenstein and I did a whole series of town halls, office meetings with our distribution partners, who we're really grateful for their focus across the US, and we're looking to extend internationally. So when you look at the momentum behind CTAC, our credit product and CAPM, we feel very, very good about it. In terms of strategy, we are not of the view that we want to flood these distribution partners and channels with multiple products. We really want to have scale and focus and long-term performance. And so you'll see us stay really focused on a mix of platform programs that we can build on over a very long period of time. And then obviously, we'll have selected targeted feeder funds, which have always been part of our strategy. In terms of the private equity product, we're still targeting 2025 as a complementary product. And that will give us the three key footholds that we want across wealth for the coming years.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. Thanks for taking my question.\nHarvey Schwartz: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Katz: Thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. Maybe turning to the capital, haven't talked about that. How should we think about the pacing for the residual $1.1 billion of repurchase? How does that triangulate up against how you think about the balance sheet? And then maybe, Harvey, I was thinking just wondering if you could give us an updated thoughts on this strategic M&A for the company. Thank you.\nJohn Redett: Yes. So, Bill, look, Harvey and I discussed in the past just we really took a step back and really rethought how we think about capital allocation, and capital allocation runs the spectrum of buying shares back, investing in the business for growth and M&A. And look, I'd say we're very pleased with the buyback activity. Last year, 2023, our share count was down. That's the first time since our IPO. I think that's a positive. Year-to-date, our share count is down again. I think that's another positive. And as I said in my remarks, we repurchased 330 million shares year-to-date. I think the best we've ever done in the past is a couple of hundred million in a year. So we're on pace to deliver a fairly large share repurchase. We have 1.1 billion remaining on the share repurchase and you should assume that we're active buyers of the stock. In terms of M&A, look, to me, it's a multifaceted question in the sense if we saw something that we like strategically and financially, the deal made sense and culturally, it was compatible, we would absolutely pivot to M&A away from the stock buyback. And again, it comes back to how do we think about allocating capital. We think about allocating capital in terms of where can we get the best returns and growth for our business, our shareholders and our stakeholders. So if something on the M&A front made sense, we would pivot away from utilizing the capital for a stock buyback and do an M&A transaction.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes. What I would say, first of all, obviously, I agree with everything John said. It's really important to understand the lens to which we look at capital allocation and the discipline we're applying to that in terms of what's marginally most accretive. But again, as I said in my remarks, sitting here now 1.5 years in at Carlyle, I really like the organic momentum and the way the team is coming together. Having said that, our platform currently gives us the flexibility to position in a lot of directions. And if the right opportunity came across, you should expect us to take action, but it has to fit all those prerequisites John just described. They're not flexible.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on insurance. I was hoping you could elaborate on the contribution from Fortitude in the quarter, how you see the pace of migrating the book over into Carlyle strategies? How is that progressing? And then just more broadly, if you could just maybe update us on your insurance and Fortitude-related initiatives and how you're strategically thinking about accelerating the pace of growth from here? Thanks.\nHarvey Schwartz: So the Fortitude partnership has been fantastic. As you know, we talked a bit about the Discover Financial Services transaction. And that really is a great example of the partnership and collaboration across credit, our CSS business, capital markets and insurance. And it really does exemplify the flywheel effect one gets by being an insurance business and across all of our insurance clients and partnerships away from Fortitude. So we feel quite good about that. In terms of our positioning with Fortitude and insurance more broadly, obviously, there's huge opportunity in the sector in a number of ways. One, obviously, is this focus on private investment grade. Again, that's a fantastic example of our asset-backed business growing so quickly over the last several years and the focus there. But more importantly, from our position being capital light, it gives us the ability to pivot and grow in any number of ways. The very narrow answer to your question, the market has been at the margin a bit more competitive in the block business. We're being disciplined about the capital deployment there. But the pipeline is quite good in terms of transaction flows around the world, reflecting various regulatory changes and needs of our insurance partners. But we feel quite good about the partnership and the trajectory all around.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nHarvey Schwartz: Hello. Good morning, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, Harvey. I think part of my name cut out, but I think you guys know who I am. Can you hear me okay?\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes, we got you. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to talk over you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Perfect. No worries at all. So I actually have another compensation question. So following the modifications you guys announced on the 4Q call, stock-based comp is running up a lot year-over-year. That's not really a surprise, but we were hoping you could give some color on how we should model stock-based comp over the next year because I believe there's a step down coming from 4Q '24 to 1Q '25 due to the roll-off of one of the stock-based comp tranches. I had in the ballpark of about $25 million per quarter, but maybe you could help us with the forward run rate of stock-based comp. Thank you very much.\nJohn Redett: Hey, Craig, it's John. Look, in terms of the stock-based comp, we've been pretty clear of saying, telling you that it will remain elevated in 2024. And look, a lot of that is driven by this performance stock unit grant we gave to key senior individuals of the firm earlier in the year, and these are the people responsible for driving growth. And as you recall, these are very, very shareholder-friendly instruments, great alignment. They only vest if the stock's up 20%, 40% and 60%. So again, very shareholder-friendly instruments. The accounting of the performance stock units is a little different in the sense. We still have to expense the award even though we don't even know if it vests and that's we're in the middle of expensing that award, very front-end loaded. So you're seeing a fairly large impact from this PSU grant. But again, I would expect third and fourth quarter stock-based comp expense to be elevated and then they start trickle down -- trickling down in 2025. I'd say directionally, the number you alluded to is probably not too far off from where I'd start.\nHarvey Schwartz: Yes, this accounting versus reality, always a little bit of a challenge. We're happy to take more of that offline for folks because this question comes up. Again, we are obviously very focused on the efficiency of how we're running the company and the discipline we're bringing to that, which is why you're seeing the share count come down so dramatically since John and I started focusing on this a bit over a year ago and all the capital planning that we've announced. But I agree it's a little confusing to see comp expense, see equity compensation expense up and share count down so much. It's a little hard to reconcile that and keep an eye on the share count.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you very much.\nOperator: I would now like to hand the conference back over to Daniel Harris for closing remarks.\nDaniel Harris: Yes. Thank you for your time and attention today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations after the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first half of '24 reflects strong momentum across our business. And as you can see when you look at it, this momentum truly clear in our results. For the first six months, we generated record FRE, record FRE margins, record assets under management and strong fundraising. Let me take a moment to talk about the current market activity. Obviously, we've all seen over the last few trading days and this morning, the market remains quite volatile. From our perspective, it's important to take a big step back. When we look at our proprietary portfolio data, this is what we see. The trajectory for GDP, the expected Fed rate cuts this year, all the dynamics still tell us the underlying fundamentals support improving activity across our platform for the balance of the year. Now consistent with that, we've announced two large recent transactions and have others in the pipeline we expect to finalize soon. In asset-backed finance, we announced a landmark $10 billion transaction to acquire portfolio of loans from Discover Financial Services. This transaction is a great example of the intersection of our asset-backed finance capabilities, our credit and insurance businesses and our capital markets expertise all coming together to drive value for our clients and generate transaction fees. As we've discussed, asset-backed finance is a critical provider of capital for the financial sector. There is a significant opportunity here to grow as we're in the early innings of a multitrillion dollar market opportunity, which we're well positioned for. On exits, we have a considerable pipeline of active IPO and sale processes underway. You just saw today, we announced the sale of our portfolio company, Cogentrix Energy, a leading power producer and the assets it manages at a valuation of nearly $3 billion. We expect exit activity in the second half of the year likely to be materially higher than the first half with several large transactions in our pipeline. Moving to fundraising. We raised $18 billion year-to-date and north of $40 billion over the last 12 months. We closed our fifth Japan buyout fund, saw strong inflows into our US real estate business and raised $5 billion in credit this quarter alone. This was our third best fundraising quarter on record for the credit business. And importantly, we're working towards our target of $40 billion for 2024. Let me just quickly run you through some specific areas of activity across our business. I'm quite optimistic about where our business is today compared to a year ago. As I said, there's a lot of momentum across the franchise. In Global Credit, we're well positioned to capitalize industry tailwinds and capture market share. In addition to the Discover Financial Services transaction, we saw strong activity in opportunistic and real asset credit strategies. In our CLO business, we remain very active. The first six months of the year were the second busiest in our 20-year CLO history. We ended Q2 as the world's largest CLO manager and we feel quite good about the forward pipeline. Finally, in Global Investment Solutions, the activity levels remain quite high as we address the investment needs of our clients. We deployed $9 billion and raised $12 million over the last 12 months and continue to see attractive opportunities across secondaries and co-investments. In Global Wealth, our brand continues to resonate with our wealth adviser partners. CTAC, our private credit product, had a strong first half. And CAPM, our solutions wealth product, has significant momentum and has been added to several new wealth distribution platforms. To wrap things up, our results this quarter reflect strong momentum across the firm as the environment continues to improve, which we believe it will, despite, as I said, recent market activity, Carlyle and our stakeholders are well positioned to benefit. With that, let me now turn the call over to John. Good morning, Glenn. Yes. So Glenn, again, thanks for the question. So obviously, the last couple of days of trading and the way the markets are positioned to open this morning, there's a lot of red on the screens. When we form our views as John and I said, we look at underlying portfolio performance and we extrapolate that data in terms of economic growth. If we were having this call last Tuesday, none of these questions would be in the mix about the current market environment. As a matter of fact, you might think we were understating the trajectory of how things felt. And so I think all of us have to be a little bit careful not to overreact to a market adjustment, which at the moment feels very, very liquidity-driven and very risk sentiment-driven. Again, if we're having this call last week, we were talking about the fact that we expected Fed rate cuts, GDP looks solid. So none of that has changed our view. Now sentiment can extend itself into problematic ways. It's way too early to extrapolate that. Portfolio performance looks good. Market opportunity feels good. Exits still feel good. Pending announcements feel good. We'll see what happens over the next several weeks in terms of market environment. But if anything, I think, this will encourage the Fed to take action, which is really what the market is looking for. And again, we ought to be reminded, one of the things we learned over the last couple of years is how the transmission mechanism when the Fed is raising rates is slower than when they're cutting. And again, my crystal ball is no better than yours, Glenn, but nothing about the last couple of days changes our view about the balance of the year at this stage. Hey, Alex. Yes. So Global Private Equity, we kind of are expecting flattish, Dan, in terms of management fees. Obviously, we're showing some real strength in the real estate side of the business. But as I said in the previous question, we do expect a couple of vintages of our private equity funds, our Europe buyout fund and Asia buyout fund to be smaller than predecessors. But we're able to mitigate that with the growth we're seeing in the real estate business and other parts of the Global Private Equity business. Good morning, Steven. So I've been spending a lot of time in this space. Just to give you some color, we launched the CAPM, which John mentioned on, a number of platforms in the past quarter. David Rubenstein and I did a whole series of town halls, office meetings with our distribution partners, who we're really grateful for their focus across the US, and we're looking to extend internationally. So when you look at the momentum behind CTAC, our credit product and CAPM, we feel very, very good about it. In terms of strategy, we are not of the view that we want to flood these distribution partners and channels with multiple products. We really want to have scale and focus and long-term performance. And so you'll see us stay really focused on a mix of platform programs that we can build on over a very long period of time. And then obviously, we'll have selected targeted feeder funds, which have always been part of our strategy. In terms of the private equity product, we're still targeting 2025 as a complementary product. And that will give us the three key footholds that we want across wealth for the coming years. Sure. Thanks. Yes. What I would say, first of all, obviously, I agree with everything John said. It's really important to understand the lens to which we look at capital allocation and the discipline we're applying to that in terms of what's marginally most accretive. But again, as I said in my remarks, sitting here now 1.5 years in at Carlyle, I really like the organic momentum and the way the team is coming together. Having said that, our platform currently gives us the flexibility to position in a lot of directions. And if the right opportunity came across, you should expect us to take action, but it has to fit all those prerequisites John just described. They're not flexible. So the Fortitude partnership has been fantastic. As you know, we talked a bit about the Discover Financial Services transaction. And that really is a great example of the partnership and collaboration across credit, our CSS business, capital markets and insurance. And it really does exemplify the flywheel effect one gets by being an insurance business and across all of our insurance clients and partnerships away from Fortitude. So we feel quite good about that. In terms of our positioning with Fortitude and insurance more broadly, obviously, there's huge opportunity in the sector in a number of ways. One, obviously, is this focus on private investment grade. Again, that's a fantastic example of our asset-backed business growing so quickly over the last several years and the focus there. But more importantly, from our position being capital light, it gives us the ability to pivot and grow in any number of ways. The very narrow answer to your question, the market has been at the margin a bit more competitive in the block business. We're being disciplined about the capital deployment there. But the pipeline is quite good in terms of transaction flows around the world, reflecting various regulatory changes and needs of our insurance partners. But we feel quite good about the partnership and the trajectory all around. Hello. Good morning, Craig. Yes, we got you. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to talk over you. Yes, this accounting versus reality, always a little bit of a challenge. We're happy to take more of that offline for folks because this question comes up. Again, we are obviously very focused on the efficiency of how we're running the company and the discipline we're bringing to that, which is why you're seeing the share count come down so dramatically since John and I started focusing on this a bit over a year ago and all the capital planning that we've announced. But I agree it's a little confusing to see comp expense, see equity compensation expense up and share count down so much. It's a little hard to reconcile that and keep an eye on the share count."

            "content": "Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see significant momentum across our platform and remain on track to achieve our 2024 financial targets. We achieved record AUM of $435 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. We also produced another quarter of record FRE and FRE margins remain strong. We produced $343 million in DE for the second quarter or $0.78 in DE per share. And year-to-date, DE per share of $1.79 is 19% higher. We repurchased 178 million of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total repurchase amount to approximately 330 million for the first half of the year. Total shares outstanding are at the lowest level since 2021 and we have 1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now let's cover three important areas. Fee-related earnings, fundraising and the investment environment. Fee-related earnings increased to $273 million in the quarter, up over 30% from the second quarter of 2023. First half FRE of $539 million is far and away a record and is 35% higher than the first half of 2023. Second quarter management fees increased 2% in the quarter to $525 million. Management fees in Global Credit and Solutions experienced double-digit growth year-over-year and hit record levels. We expect total management fees to accelerate across the second half of the year driven by the nearly $20 billion of pending fee-earning AUM, the highest level since 2021. Transaction and advisory fees were up almost 60% year-over-year driven by the steadily improving transaction environment. We are on pace for a record year. We continue to drive towards our target of $1.1 billion of FRE for 2024, implying FRE in the second half of 2024 will be higher than the first half. Let's turn to fundraising. Year-to-date, we raised $18 billion in new capital and $41 billion over the last 12 months. We saw meaningful activity in this quarter in both Global Private Equity and Global Credit. In Global Private Equity, we closed our fifth vintage Japan buyout fund, nearly 70% larger than its predecessor. Across Asia, this brings us to $5 billion of capital raised. We recently announced the take private of KFC Japan, where our pan-Asia teams came together to leverage our significant expertise in the restaurant and food sector. This remains a robust market for us. In terms of our latest real estate fund, we closed on amount materially higher than what we disclosed in our earnings release and we are progressing quickly to a final close. In a challenging real estate market, it's worth noting the exceptional performance of our franchise, which remains a key area of growth. In Global Credit, we raised $5 billion in the quarter. As Harvey said, we had one of the most active first six months in our 20-plus year CLO history. We also benefited from continued strength in our credit wealth product, CTAC, as well as other strategies. For the balance of the year, we expect to raise significant capital across all segments as we continue to work towards our target of $40 billion. Finally, let me touch on the investment environment. As Harvey mentioned, we are seeing increased investment activity across the business as buyer and seller confidence has improved despite recent volatility. We have access to great proprietary data across our global platform, which also points to increased activity levels. In terms of exit activity, we now are seeing more robust competition where an IPO is a real exit path and strategic buyer interest has picked up. We expect increased activity in the second half of 2024. Wrapping up, we continue to focus on delivering strong results for our shareholders. We have good momentum across our platform and are on track to achieve the financial targets that we laid out for 2024. With that let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Hey, Alex, it's John. Look, we feel very good about the momentum we have in fundraising. We obviously had a very strong quarter in the second quarter. We're at $18 billion year-to-date. As I said in my remarks, we're at $41 billion in the last 12 months. So we do feel like we're working to the $40 billion. And as I look at kind of the next six months, it's really across the platform where we're raising money. We have a lot of product strategies in the market. I think you'll see continued momentum in our Solutions business, both the secondaries, the co-investment fund. As Harvey said, the CAPM wealth product is on more platforms. So we feel good about that. In terms of our credit business, we're seeing good momentum in our wealth product there, CTAC. You'll continue to see strength in our credit opportunities fund, our infra credit fund, and CLO activity will continue. And then when I look at kind of Global Private Equity, you'll see continued strength in our real estate fundraise. As I said earlier, we have a lot of momentum. We're at a number that's materially higher than we disclosed. And later in the year, we'll be launching infrastructure product as well and we have two buyout funds in the market. So we have a lot of strategies in the market in the back half and we feel really -- we're quite positive on the momentum we have. Hey, Ken, it's John. Look, I'm limited in terms of what I can say specifically about CAP VI because we are in the market raising money. And we've been pretty clear previously stating that we do think the current fund CAP VI will be smaller than its predecessor fund and we've said that as well for CEP. Look, our CAP business it's really facing some geopolitical headwinds. But look, overall, in terms of Asia, as I said, we've raised $5 billion. We continue to see very attractive opportunities in Asia. I referenced the KFC transaction, which was a kind of a pan-Asia effort. But this is -- our Asia business is a very important business to us, and we're fully committed to it. As to where we end up in CAP VI, I can't really provide you a number. Thanks, Ken. Yes. This is John. Look, this has been a focus area for the firm the last 12 months. Harvey has been very clear that the firm is focused on this particular part of our business. I would say we're very pleased with the progress we've made. When you look at how the growth we're generating in this business over the last six months, it's quite impressive. It's up 60%. And obviously, it's benefiting from a more conducive transaction environment. And we kind of looking at the pipeline of exits as well as new transactions really across the platform, not just specific to private equity. We feel like this will be a record year for our kind of transaction capital market fees. Yes, Brian, it's John. Look, as Harvey said in this call, we're long-term investors, not to focus on day-to-day market volatility or market generations. But look, if we're in extend period of a down market, I can't -- I don't know what happens, but I think it's probably less positive than where we sit today. But looking at the pipeline today, we see tremendous transaction activity in the back half. So we feel very good about that. And it's really again, as I said earlier, it's not only private equity. It's in credit and it's in solutions. I mean if you look at the deployment levels we've had in our Solutions business, it's quite strong. We're at $4.5 billion year-to-date, and they have a very good pipeline. So I'd say it's broad-based. I don't -- I'm not smart enough to tell you where the markets are going to be. But where we sit today, we feel very good about the deployment. In terms of the $20 billion of pending fee earning AUM, which is really the highest level it's been since 2021, and there's some Global Private Equity AUM in that number and there's also some credit. You should expect that to be turned on over the coming quarters. So in Global Private Equity, we have Japan buyout in there. We have real estate. And in Global Credit, it's really spread across the platform. But you should assume those fees turn on over the coming quarters. Yes, Patrick, it's John. Yes, look, we're very pleased with where we are on that ratio. But I have to be honest, we're not managing the business to hit that specific ratio. And we've always said we're going to operate within the range we specified in our fourth quarter. You should expect us to operate in that range but plus or minus 1% or 2% from kind of where we are, which is the midpoint or at the upper end of that range at 35% is where you should expect us to operate the business. Look, we're very mindful of investing in the business for growth, not necessarily completely focused on driving the margin, but more focused on investing in these businesses for growth. Yes. So we announced the merger of our public BDCs merging with a private BDC, and we'll provide more details over time. And it likely won't close, Brian, until Q1 2025. But look the benefit to us is we get more scale in the public BDC. It is a scale business. I think it will be easier for us to raise equity capital going forward. That's obviously financially attractive to the firm. But also there is a benefit to FRE with this merger and we'll quantify that as we get closer to the close. But it's net-net, it's a positive for Carlyle. Yes. So, Bill, look, Harvey and I discussed in the past just we really took a step back and really rethought how we think about capital allocation, and capital allocation runs the spectrum of buying shares back, investing in the business for growth and M&A. And look, I'd say we're very pleased with the buyback activity. Last year, 2023, our share count was down. That's the first time since our IPO. I think that's a positive. Year-to-date, our share count is down again. I think that's another positive. And as I said in my remarks, we repurchased 330 million shares year-to-date. I think the best we've ever done in the past is a couple of hundred million in a year. So we're on pace to deliver a fairly large share repurchase. We have 1.1 billion remaining on the share repurchase and you should assume that we're active buyers of the stock. In terms of M&A, look, to me, it's a multifaceted question in the sense if we saw something that we like strategically and financially, the deal made sense and culturally, it was compatible, we would absolutely pivot to M&A away from the stock buyback. And again, it comes back to how do we think about allocating capital. We think about allocating capital in terms of where can we get the best returns and growth for our business, our shareholders and our stakeholders. So if something on the M&A front made sense, we would pivot away from utilizing the capital for a stock buyback and do an M&A transaction. Hey, Craig, it's John. Look, in terms of the stock-based comp, we've been pretty clear of saying, telling you that it will remain elevated in 2024. And look, a lot of that is driven by this performance stock unit grant we gave to key senior individuals of the firm earlier in the year, and these are the people responsible for driving growth. And as you recall, these are very, very shareholder-friendly instruments, great alignment. They only vest if the stock's up 20%, 40% and 60%. So again, very shareholder-friendly instruments. The accounting of the performance stock units is a little different in the sense. We still have to expense the award even though we don't even know if it vests and that's we're in the middle of expensing that award, very front-end loaded. So you're seeing a fairly large impact from this PSU grant. But again, I would expect third and fourth quarter stock-based comp expense to be elevated and then they start trickle down -- trickling down in 2025. I'd say directionally, the number you alluded to is probably not too far off from where I'd start."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to The Carlyle Group's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  \n Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  \n I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Daniel Harris, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nDaniel Harris: Thank you, Norma. Good morning, and welcome to Carlyle's first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz; and our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Strategy, John Redett. \n Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and a detailed earnings presentation, which is also available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have provided reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our earnings release to the extent reasonably available.  \n Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Carlyle assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time.  \n In order to ensure participation by all those on the line today, please limit yourself to 1 question and then return to the queue for any additional follow-ups. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Schwartz. \nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to touch on 3 areas today. First, our financial performance and an update on our 2024 targets. Second, Carlyle's ability to capitalize on an improving macroeconomic environment. And third, progress on key strategic areas.  \n First, our performance. Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum across the firm, and importantly, we are on track to achieve our 2024 financial targets, including targeting FRE of $1.1 billion, targeting FRE margins to increase to a range of 40% to 50%, and targeting inflows of $40 billion in 2024.  \n We once again set several financial records this quarter, including record quarterly FRE of $266 million, a near 40% increase over first quarter last year and record FRE margin of 47%, more than 33% higher than last year. These results are the outcome of our efforts to prioritize operational excellence and optimize our business model, while at the same time enabling us to invest for growth. We anticipate a pickup in fundraising, deployment and realization throughout the year, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets for 2024.  \n With respect to fundraising, we raised $5.3 billion in new capital in the quarter, in line with our expectations, after a near record quarter closing out 2023. Looking forward, we expect to see a pickup in fundraising over the next few quarters, again, keeping us in line with our target.  \n While the macroeconomic environment remains somewhat fragile, we continue to see signs that the investment environment is steadily improving. Capital from the banking system and private credit is more readily available. Private credit and syndicated loan spreads are at historically tight levels. Equity volatility is under long-term averages. And interest rates and inflation have generally stabilized. These are clear improvements from this time last year, which is driving increased investor confidence, and if sentiment continues to improve, we expect a higher level of deal activity.  \n Our deal teams are already starting to see the knock-on effects of improved market sentiment. We had $5.9 billion of realized proceeds this quarter. We have to go back to the fourth quarter of 2022 to see a higher number. We've already announced additional exits in various strategies that will close in the coming quarters. We have $2.2 billion in net accrued carry across our portfolio, and our global pipeline continues to increase.  \n Carlyle is well-positioned to capitalize on these improving market conditions over the coming months. We have high-quality assets in our portfolio ready to be monetized and $76 billion in dry powder ready to be deployed across our global franchise.  \n Switching gears, I want to provide an update on our strategic areas of focus. In Global wealth, we have strong momentum. Since inception, we raised nearly $50 billion of wealth assets. Our global scale and brand give us a competitive advantage in this rapidly growing distribution channel. I have witnessed the importance of our brand and quality of our funds firsthand in my personal interactions with wealth advisers. We want to ensure we're providing the most efficient access to alternative markets alongside the best funds for our end clients.  \n Our credit fund CTAC had another strong quarter, and our secondary focused investment solutions product, CAPM, saw a ramp-up in sales. These funds have historically provided strong performance for our investors. We continue to expand our footprint, adding new wealth distribution partners in the near term.  \n More broadly in Global Credit, we're focused on driving growth and capturing share. We see opportunity to continue to scale our asset-backed finance offering, a trend that may persist for years as market participants increasingly look to partner with firms like Carlyle to address their capital solutions. We have mobilized and scaled our credit strategic solutions team to address this opportunity. This strategy has grown to more than $7 billion in assets with good opportunity for continued growth.  \n And finally, in Global Investment Solutions, we continue to see strong momentum. This is helping us both in the institutional channel as well as in the wealth channel with our secondary focused CAPM fund. And obviously, this business is somewhat countercyclical to the rest of the franchise.  \n To wrap things up, we entered 2024 with solid momentum. We continue to execute against our financial targets and strategic areas of focus. All of this positions us to deliver significant growth and shareholder value.  \n With that, let me now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Redett: Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. As Harvey said, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve the 2024 financial targets we outlined on last quarter's call.  \n For the first quarter, we generated record FRE of $266 million, nearly 40% higher than the first quarter last year. FRE margin of 47% was also a record and up from 35% in Q1 2023.  \n We produced $431 million in DE or $1.01 in DE per share, our best quarterly DE result since 2022. We finished the first quarter with $425 billion of assets under management, up 12% year-over-year.  \n In the first quarter, we completed the sales of McDonald's China and Neptune Energy, both of which produce attractive returns for LPs and strong performance revenues for our shareholders. Over the past year, we have returned $22 billion in capital to our LPs, highlighting the ability of our investment teams to find liquidity opportunities in difficult and challenging capital markets.  \n We raised $5.3 billion of capital in the quarter and remain confident in achieving our target of $40 billion of inflows for the year.  \n In Solutions, we raised $2.3 billion in the quarter and nearly $14 billion over the last 12 months, as we continue to have success attracting investors to our secondaries and co-investment strategies. And we are starting to see momentum building in our global wealth product, CAPM. In Global Credit, where our CLO platform is one of the largest in the industry, we had an active quarter in a very active market. We priced 7 CLOs, including 3 new issue CLOs. We also saw a strong inflow activity into our global wealth product, CTAC, and continue to see capital raise for our asset-backed finance strategy.  \n And in Global Private Equity, the fundraising environment remains somewhat challenging, but we do see some pockets of strength like real estate in Japan.  \n Management fees totaled $516 million in the first quarter, up about 2% compared to the prior year. We have $15 billion of pending fee-earning AUM that has yet to activate fees. Capital markets activity remains constrained, but it is showing signs of improvement. Transaction and advisory revenues of $27 million increased more than 60% from the first quarter last year.  \n G&A expenses of $80 million were lower compared to the first quarter last year as we benefited from expense discipline and had some onetime items that lowered the quarterly G&A level. We expect G&A expense to shift back towards the recent run rate in the second quarter.  \n Our net accrued carry balance of $2.2 billion declined relative to last quarter due to fund realizations and a relatively lower level of appreciation in our carry funds. And at $6 per share, it remains a substantial source of future earnings.  \n We repurchased 150 million of stock, decreasing our adjusted shares outstanding by 1%. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $1.25 billion, and we remain active buyers of our stock.  \n Wrapping up, we are optimistic about market conditions improving, and we are on track to meet our financial targets for 2024. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: Maybe you could just talk about how you're viewing the FRE trajectory for the balance of 2024, and maybe just the components on that. Given the lower expenses, maybe if you can classify the help from the lower G&A expense in 1Q and where you see the expenses moving as we move through the year, and then contrasting that with fee-related revenue. So really the sort of the underlying components of how you see the FRE improving during the year? \nHarvey Schwartz: Thanks, Brian. So look, we're very pleased with the FRE for the quarter $266 million. It was a record. It was up 40% over same period last year. The margin was very strong as well; that compared to 37% last year.  \n In terms of the margin at 47%, and I alluded to this in my comments on the G&A, we did benefit from a lower G&A. Some of that was expense discipline on our end. Some of it was a little seasonality. Historically, if you look at our first quarter, G&A is typically a little lighter in Q1, and we did have a couple of one-off items. So I expect the G&A number to increase to more normalized run rate levels in the second quarter.  \n So I would expect the FRE margin in the next couple of quarters to be in the mid-40s versus the 47%. And look, the mid-40s is right in the middle of the range we put out in our 2024 financial targets of 40% to 50%. So we feel pretty good at 45%.  \n In terms of management fees, I would say the number came in exactly as expected. There were no surprises, positive or negative, on our end. And I do think through the year, given that we had a really strong fourth quarter in terms of fundraising, nearly $17 billion, and we have $15 billion of fee paying -- pending fee paying AUM, I would expect that number to start to accelerate throughout the year, and I think that growth will accelerate as well. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan Securities. \nKenneth Worthington: Fee paying AUM, so, lower in both private equity and credit this quarter. And we know things don't move in a straight line. Maybe first, can you talk about the drivers of the decline in private credit fee-paying AUM this quarter? I think you highlighted some elevated outflows in the release. And based on your fundraising, fund activations and realizations, how should we think about fee paying AUM developing from current levels in both private equity and credit as we kind of migrate through the year? \nJohn Redett: Yes. Ken, we have very good momentum in terms of fundraising. We have some products in the market that have real demand. Our secondaries business, our Solutions business, we're seeing real good demand, both in secondaries and co-investment. I would expect that to continue. As we said in the past, we've had good momentum in Japan. We'll be wrapping that one up at some point this year. Real estate is another area where we think we'll have really strong demand. We'll start that fundraise this year as well, and we do expect that to be a successful fundraise. So I would expect to see an acceleration in growth in the fee-paying AUM as well.  \n In terms of the kind of slight decline in fee paying AUM in credit, it was just normal course runoff. And again, the runoff is outside of carry funds. So it was just a small amount of normal course business-as-usual runoff. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: Maybe just following up on the $15 billion of pending fee-paying AUM, and John, your comments on the confidence in achieving the $40 billion plus for the year, can you sort of just unpack the major pieces? We know there's a lot of PE funds in the market. How much is left on the solutions fundraises that you're doing? What are the key pieces of the credit side? Can you give us a little color there? That would be great. \nHarvey Schwartz: Yes. Maybe I'll jump in. And so we're not going to walk through fund by fund, which I'm sure you understand. But as John said, and I've been traveling the world the past 6 months, you can really feel the momentum in the pockets of strength that John hit on. So in Solutions, in the Wealth channel across credit, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect to be joining additional wealth platforms, new partners coming on in terms of CAPM and CTAC. \n And so there's a lot of momentum around Wealth, secondaries, credit, and as John mentioned, pockets of the private equity segment and real estate and other areas, I would say, generally in private equity across the industry in this environment, you should maybe expect some headwinds.  \n Now of course, I think over the next several years, the institutional channel might be a little over-allocated, but the wealth channel is clearly under-allocated. And so we look forward to also bringing out our private equity wealth product in the first half of next year. And so it feels like across the franchise momentum is quite good, and that's why we reiterate the targets for this year.  \n And also, the other thing I'll say is we understand the focus on the quarter-to-quarter. We focus on it for running a business, just not really how we think about the fundraising. As John said, this was perfectly on plan for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: I was hoping we can spend a minute on your outlook for share repurchases for the rest of the year. Harvey, I think on the last call, you talked about up to $1.4 billion, now it's $1.2 billion in authorization, being a function of kind of quarters, not years. Can we maybe get a little more specific here on the outlook for the rest of the year? \n And related to that, how should we be thinking about equity-based compensation on a quarterly basis from here, I guess, given that it stepped up quite meaningfully as well? \nJohn Redett: Alex, it's John. We repurchased 150 million of stock, as I said in my remarks, historically, we've averaged roughly $200 million per year, per annum. So the first quarter was pretty significant relative to what we've done in the past. We still have $1.25 billion left on the share repurchase authorization. And you should just assume we're active purchasers of the stock going forward.  \n In terms of the equity-based comp, this is really -- it got elevated due to the performance stock units we granted to key senior members of our investment teams, our team globally. And these are the people that are driving growth. These are the people that are accountable for growth. And the accounting on these instruments are a bit different. So you're seeing a little bit of elevation from those performance stock unit grants.  \n Remember, these only vest if we have meaningful stock price appreciation. So I think these are very, very shareholder-friendly instruments, great alignment. I would expect the equity-based comp number to start trending down next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with Citizens JMP. \nBrian Mckenna: I appreciate the commentary on the buyback. But it seems like there's some capacity to increase the dividend given the earnings outlook moving forward, specifically if realizations remain healthy. So how are you thinking about the dividend moving forward? And do you see an opportunity to increase the payout ratio over time? \nHarvey Schwartz: It's Harvey. So as John said, and maybe just taking a step back and again go through how we're thinking about the capital allocation methodology here. And so we're going to remain very flexible because we see very significant opportunities to invest in the business over the next couple of years. But we also see opportunities to return capital to shareholders. And that was really the strategic decision about going with the buyback, because it gives us that flexibility.  \n In the immediate term, we expect no changes to the dividend. Of course, again, we're not tying ourselves in the math here, depending on how things move forward. But right now, it really is about positioning ourselves for dynamic flexibility around capital allocation. So we can invest in the business when we see the most accretive opportunities, which we're currently doing, and we can also return value to shareholders. And as John said, you should expect to see us be active in the stock. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. \nBrennan Hawken: You guys flagged in the investment performance slide that there's an uptick in U.S. and European CLO default rates. So I'm curious about what your exposure is to Altice in the European or the global CLO business. And how should we be thinking about the risk of deterioration and increased defaults as far as the potential for management fee deferrals in that business? \nJohn Redett: Yes, Brennan, it's John. So look, we really like our CLO business. We're one of the largest in the world. At any given time, we're 1 or 2. Look, this business has great margins. They have a long-term, highly attractive track record. And when you look at kind of credit in the platform, it still looks very, very good. \n Our default rates in our U.S. business are 1/2 of the industry average. The credit stats in Europe are not quite as good as the U.S., but they are still better than European industry averages. So from a credit quality perspective, we feel very good about the credit quality in our CLO business. \nHarvey Schwartz: It really is a world-class franchise with a world-class team. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: You talked about wealth and increasing partnerships and distribution through that channel. Can you give us what the number of flows were from the wealth channel this quarter, and which products you see are driving those flows and where you see that kind of the outlook for that going forward? \nHarvey Schwartz: I've personally been spending increasing amounts of my time with our wealth partners, and I can tell you, I'm pretty close to a cold case on this, we've been really well received. The brand Carlyle, our history in the business, our long track record, the name recognition, just the iconic aspect of the firm really resonates with the wealth advisers. Now of course, we've been in the wealth channel for a very long time. As I mentioned, we raised nearly $50 billion of assets. But this new shift in terms of how the market is really receiving in the early days of whatever you want to call it, democratization, et cetera. \n But I'm personally spending a lot of time with wealth advisers, truly trying to get very close to understanding how we can be the best value partner to them. And with CTAC growing steadily, CAPM picking up momentum, our secondaries product, we will be making some announcements in the near term of some new partnership launches, I feel really good about the momentum here. And again, obviously, first half of next year, we're targeting the private equity product. \n So I feel really good about how our business is being received. This is going to be a long journey for the industry, but I feel really optimistic about our long-term growth trajectory. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. \nChristoph Kotowski: I realize you didn't want to go fund by fund, but when I look at the fund tables, it looks like your Asia V Fund steps down in June and then Europe V in September. So should we be expecting kind of a new fund launch around those dates? Or do you effectively not have a flagship vehicle after those dates in Europe and Asia? \nHarvey Schwartz: A little confused. But, no, we have flagship vehicles in those regions. I think, again, Chris, the way to think about it is really the way John addressed it, which is we expect -- he's given you a pretty good color on this, a pickup in management fees across the platform throughout the rest of the year. And everything remains on plan. We're happy to get into more detail with you offline. \nChristoph Kotowski: Okay. And then also, can you give us any color on -- it said Page, I think, 11, that there were some reversals of prior performance allocations. Can you just give us some color on what happened there? Is that like related to European style waterfalls -- or what happened? \nJohn Redett: I mean, look, the first thing I'd say is, Chris, we don't manage the business quarter-to-quarter in terms of performance. I came from the private equity side of the business where I spent 16 years, ran several funds there. I honestly never really focused on quarter-to-quarter performance. I always took a kind of a long-term view, what is the long-term trajectory. So I know you guys focus quarter-to-quarter movement, but we don't really manage the business that way. \n So CP VII was barely in -- carry the previous quarter. It fell out of carry this quarter. So that's the impact you're seeing. But look, we've been in this business, the private equity business, for 35 years. We've generated very strong returns for our LPs, 26% over that period, 2.4x their money. So we're very proud of those returns. \n The only thing I'd tell you is we've always been very, very focused on performance. And not surprisingly, going forward, we will continue to be very focused on performance. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. \nPatrick Davitt: I want to circle back on the flow commentary. I understand there's some seasonality, but obviously just run-rating to about $20 billion of flow this year versus $40 billion target. So maybe when you budget this, could you maybe help us understand what you see as the biggest incremental contributions to closing that gap between $20 billion and $40 billion and what you think the cadence through the rest of the year of building to that $40 billion will be? \nJohn Redett: Yes. Again, Patrick, what Harvey said, it's very tough to look at fundraising on a quarter-by-quarter basis, stuff slips, stuff moves forward. Again, the fundraising number for the first quarter came in as expected. So that should tell you something in terms of how we think we can get to the $40 billion. We're still confident in the $40 billion. \n And I think Harvey gave you some color around where that fundraising is coming from. We continue to see a lot of interest in our Solutions business, both secondaries, co-investment. In Private Equity, we're going to have some -- we'll have some demand -- strong demand for our real estate product. We have good demand for Japan. In Credit, our asset-backed platform has gone from almost nothing to upsize in 2 years. On the Wealth side, we're really starting to see more momentum in CTAC, CAPM, our solutions wealth product, that's just kind of starting, but getting good momentum. \n So it's really, really across the platform. I wouldn't say one specific segment is an outlier. \nHarvey Schwartz: Yes, if we have to risk like that, I wouldn't make -- we'd be misguiding you if we, in any way, suggest that you should take the first quarter multiplied by 4. I think that's our point here. You should really hear us when we say we expect a significant momentum in that. This was exactly on plan for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: So in the past, you had spoken about the significance of the IPO market reopening. Certainly starting to see some green shoots. But just concerning the PE transaction environment, I was hoping you could speak to whether that recent pickup supports more durable improvement in realization activity, or is it still too early to call an inflection? \nJohn Redett: It's John. I think it's helpful just to kind of level set where we are. We're coming out of a very, very complex environment. And having spent most of my career in private equity, it was one of the more complex environments I've seen. Yet our team has been able to generate $22 billion of realizations through that period in some pretty choppy markets. \n And then I said in my comments, we had a strong quarter in terms of realizations. I noted McDonald's China and Neptune Energy. I know these portfolios really well. I spent a lot of time in that business. I feel good about these portfolios. I also like the momentum we have. So I mean if the markets continue to improve, I would expect that momentum to accelerate. But it's market dependent, obviously. \n In terms of your comments on the IPO markets, I think the IPO markets are kind of open. I know a lot of the bankers and headlines say they're open, but I would say they are opening. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. \nGlenn Schorr: Question on the insurance side. Just in terms of what we should expect from new business. We didn't talk about it much yet today. And the reason I'm asking is some of the insurance companies have been talking about lightening up and pulling back on block trades and trying to raise third-party capital themselves. I'm not sure how many of them have the capacity to raise that and manage that themselves, but it's -- I heard it from more than a couple of places. So curious on your thoughts on the deal environment and what we should expect from your insurance business? \nHarvey Schwartz: The pipeline feels pretty good here, Glenn, in terms of -- you saw us close and execute the Lincoln National transaction last year, and we talked about the economics and how that flows through FRE over the medium term. But the pipeline feels pretty good. \n I think there are going to be times when it's going to ebb and flow in the marketplace. But I think if you look over the long term in terms of insurers need to dynamically manage their capital, I think quarter 2 is really, really well positioned to be a great partner and has been a great partner. So I feel pretty good about the pipeline. \n In terms of insurance more broadly, I would say the space remains increasingly important to us with a lot of momentum. There's a real cross-section here and a flywheel effect between capital needed, an ability to generate enhanced performance in private credit, banks looking at more optimized -- better optimize their capital structures. And so we're in the thick of a lot of flows here. \n And I think this is pretty persistent. It feels like this is going to go on for a while. I never like to bring out my crystal ball on these calls, but it feels like there's a lot of momentum here and this is a multiyear trend. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. \nWilliam Katz: Maybe a step back, you mentioned that there's some good demand in real estate. I was wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. And then maybe the broader question associated with just the asset class or the segment in total is how are you thinking about the opportunity infrastructure? And how is Carlyle positioned to maybe participate in what seems to be a pretty big opportunity? \nHarvey Schwartz: So in real estate, as we've discussed before, really is a world-class franchise. They're in the market now. The performance has been exceptional. They'll be in their tenth fundraise. And I think in a space which is not drawing a lot of capital, they really are extraordinary team with a lot of momentum. \n And we see the opportunity quite optimistically across the rest of the real assets platform, whether it's in renewables, infrastructure, energy. I think the natural demands of what's happening really around the globe, whether you look at geopolitics, energy transition, demand for energy, energy security, all these things bode well. And I think there are platforms which will continue to grow. And so you should look to see us continue to invest and continue to build on the platforms we have, but we feel pretty good there too. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Just wanted to circle back to the realization commentary. I was hoping you may be able to help quantify the pipeline of exits that you were alluding to. And when we look at the overall portfolio, it seems about nearly 50% is aged 40 years, which could suggest maybe we could see a meaningful pickup in exit activity market depending. But just curious what portion of the portfolio do you view as in the exit phase and just waiting for that right backdrop. \nJohn Redett: Yes. I mean I don't know if I'd quantify in terms of percentage of portfolio. And that stat you alluded to that's 4 years or older, that's really not specific to Carlyle. That's an industry-wide stat. So look, we have a lot of great companies that are ready, we're ready to monetize. We just need markets to continue to improve. We need the IPO markets to really open up. That will be helpful. \n But as I said, if the markets continue to move on the current trajectory, I do expect realization activity to pick up. It's one of the hardest aspects of this business to project. If you could tell me where markets are in 6 months, I could probably give you a very specific answer. I just don't know. But the way it looks today, we're pretty optimistic that realizations will accelerate. \nMichael Cyprys: Sorry, just to clarify. On Page 17, there was a chart next to the $159 billion of AUM in private equity with a note saying 48% age 4 plus years. That's not for Carlyle, that's for the industry? \nJohn Redett: Yes, that is our stat, but I think the industry stats are somewhat similar. I don't think we're an outlier at all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Hope everyone is doing well. So we had a follow-up on the CLO question, just given your commentary that defaults are rising in Europe. So quick math, I think European CLO AUM is around $11 billion, and about half of those are subordinated fees, and they can be deferred if certain tests are not met. So about $30 million run rate, near 100% incremental FRE margins. I'm curious, is that math correct? And then also, are those tests still being met or will be met given the rise in default commentary in the earnings release? \nJohn Redett: Yes, Craig, it's John. Look, we're not concerned with the credit quality stats in the European CLO business. They are elevated relative to the U.S., although I would tell you the U.S. are extremely low. And the credit stats in the European CLO business are still below industry. I think it's important to recognize we've been in this business for 25-plus years. We have a great long-term track record. We have a very deep and talented team leading this investment effort. And over that 25-year period, we have collected 100% of the management fees and the subordinated management fees. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. \nBrennan Hawken: Totally appreciate that stock-based comp is expected to drop in 2025. But when we think about 2024, is this $111 million quarterly run rate the right way to think about this year? Or could there be movement off of this level? \nJohn Redett: I don't think it's far off. It might creep up a little bit. Again, it's -- and we can take this offline. The accounting around the performance stock units is a bit different relative to traditional equity awards, but I don't think it will move up in a material way. I'm happy to take it offline with you and give you details around the accounting. \nHarvey Schwartz: The important thing again is the alignment that John talked about. You have to have a very meaningful uptick in the share price. And so as we've discussed, this really aligns the senior leadership of the firm with the shareholders. It's a little bit the accounting is the accounting. But we'll take it offline for you. \nOperator: At this time, this concludes our Q&A portion. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Daniel Harris for closing remarks. \nDaniel Harris: Thanks, operator. And thank you, everyone, for your time and attention today. If you have any questions or follow-ups, please contact Investor Relations after this call, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Harvey Schwartz",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to touch on 3 areas today. First, our financial performance and an update on our 2024 targets. Second, Carlyle's ability to capitalize on an improving macroeconomic environment. And third, progress on key strategic areas.  \n First, our performance. Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum across the firm, and importantly, we are on track to achieve our 2024 financial targets, including targeting FRE of $1.1 billion, targeting FRE margins to increase to a range of 40% to 50%, and targeting inflows of $40 billion in 2024.  \n We once again set several financial records this quarter, including record quarterly FRE of $266 million, a near 40% increase over first quarter last year and record FRE margin of 47%, more than 33% higher than last year. These results are the outcome of our efforts to prioritize operational excellence and optimize our business model, while at the same time enabling us to invest for growth. We anticipate a pickup in fundraising, deployment and realization throughout the year, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets for 2024.  \n With respect to fundraising, we raised $5.3 billion in new capital in the quarter, in line with our expectations, after a near record quarter closing out 2023. Looking forward, we expect to see a pickup in fundraising over the next few quarters, again, keeping us in line with our target.  \n While the macroeconomic environment remains somewhat fragile, we continue to see signs that the investment environment is steadily improving. Capital from the banking system and private credit is more readily available. Private credit and syndicated loan spreads are at historically tight levels. Equity volatility is under long-term averages. And interest rates and inflation have generally stabilized. These are clear improvements from this time last year, which is driving increased investor confidence, and if sentiment continues to improve, we expect a higher level of deal activity.  \n Our deal teams are already starting to see the knock-on effects of improved market sentiment. We had $5.9 billion of realized proceeds this quarter. We have to go back to the fourth quarter of 2022 to see a higher number. We've already announced additional exits in various strategies that will close in the coming quarters. We have $2.2 billion in net accrued carry across our portfolio, and our global pipeline continues to increase.  \n Carlyle is well-positioned to capitalize on these improving market conditions over the coming months. We have high-quality assets in our portfolio ready to be monetized and $76 billion in dry powder ready to be deployed across our global franchise.  \n Switching gears, I want to provide an update on our strategic areas of focus. In Global wealth, we have strong momentum. Since inception, we raised nearly $50 billion of wealth assets. Our global scale and brand give us a competitive advantage in this rapidly growing distribution channel. I have witnessed the importance of our brand and quality of our funds firsthand in my personal interactions with wealth advisers. We want to ensure we're providing the most efficient access to alternative markets alongside the best funds for our end clients.  \n Our credit fund CTAC had another strong quarter, and our secondary focused investment solutions product, CAPM, saw a ramp-up in sales. These funds have historically provided strong performance for our investors. We continue to expand our footprint, adding new wealth distribution partners in the near term.  \n More broadly in Global Credit, we're focused on driving growth and capturing share. We see opportunity to continue to scale our asset-backed finance offering, a trend that may persist for years as market participants increasingly look to partner with firms like Carlyle to address their capital solutions. We have mobilized and scaled our credit strategic solutions team to address this opportunity. This strategy has grown to more than $7 billion in assets with good opportunity for continued growth.  \n And finally, in Global Investment Solutions, we continue to see strong momentum. This is helping us both in the institutional channel as well as in the wealth channel with our secondary focused CAPM fund. And obviously, this business is somewhat countercyclical to the rest of the franchise.  \n To wrap things up, we entered 2024 with solid momentum. We continue to execute against our financial targets and strategic areas of focus. All of this positions us to deliver significant growth and shareholder value.  \n With that, let me now turn the call over to John. Thanks, Brian. So look, we're very pleased with the FRE for the quarter $266 million. It was a record. It was up 40% over same period last year. The margin was very strong as well; that compared to 37% last year.  \n In terms of the margin at 47%, and I alluded to this in my comments on the G&A, we did benefit from a lower G&A. Some of that was expense discipline on our end. Some of it was a little seasonality. Historically, if you look at our first quarter, G&A is typically a little lighter in Q1, and we did have a couple of one-off items. So I expect the G&A number to increase to more normalized run rate levels in the second quarter.  \n So I would expect the FRE margin in the next couple of quarters to be in the mid-40s versus the 47%. And look, the mid-40s is right in the middle of the range we put out in our 2024 financial targets of 40% to 50%. So we feel pretty good at 45%.  \n In terms of management fees, I would say the number came in exactly as expected. There were no surprises, positive or negative, on our end. And I do think through the year, given that we had a really strong fourth quarter in terms of fundraising, nearly $17 billion, and we have $15 billion of fee paying -- pending fee paying AUM, I would expect that number to start to accelerate throughout the year, and I think that growth will accelerate as well. Yes. Maybe I'll jump in. And so we're not going to walk through fund by fund, which I'm sure you understand. But as John said, and I've been traveling the world the past 6 months, you can really feel the momentum in the pockets of strength that John hit on. So in Solutions, in the Wealth channel across credit, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect to be joining additional wealth platforms, new partners coming on in terms of CAPM and CTAC. \n And so there's a lot of momentum around Wealth, secondaries, credit, and as John mentioned, pockets of the private equity segment and real estate and other areas, I would say, generally in private equity across the industry in this environment, you should maybe expect some headwinds.  \n Now of course, I think over the next several years, the institutional channel might be a little over-allocated, but the wealth channel is clearly under-allocated. And so we look forward to also bringing out our private equity wealth product in the first half of next year. And so it feels like across the franchise momentum is quite good, and that's why we reiterate the targets for this year.  \n And also, the other thing I'll say is we understand the focus on the quarter-to-quarter. We focus on it for running a business, just not really how we think about the fundraising. As John said, this was perfectly on plan for us. It's Harvey. So as John said, and maybe just taking a step back and again go through how we're thinking about the capital allocation methodology here. And so we're going to remain very flexible because we see very significant opportunities to invest in the business over the next couple of years. But we also see opportunities to return capital to shareholders. And that was really the strategic decision about going with the buyback, because it gives us that flexibility.  \n In the immediate term, we expect no changes to the dividend. Of course, again, we're not tying ourselves in the math here, depending on how things move forward. But right now, it really is about positioning ourselves for dynamic flexibility around capital allocation. So we can invest in the business when we see the most accretive opportunities, which we're currently doing, and we can also return value to shareholders. And as John said, you should expect to see us be active in the stock. It really is a world-class franchise with a world-class team. I've personally been spending increasing amounts of my time with our wealth partners, and I can tell you, I'm pretty close to a cold case on this, we've been really well received. The brand Carlyle, our history in the business, our long track record, the name recognition, just the iconic aspect of the firm really resonates with the wealth advisers.

And with CTAC growing steadily, CAPM picking up momentum, our secondaries product, we will be making some announcements in the near term of some new partnership launches, I feel really good about the momentum here. And again, obviously, first half of next year, we're targeting the private equity product. \n So I feel really good about how our business is being received. This is going to be a long journey for the industry, but I feel really optimistic about our long-term growth trajectory. A little confused. But, no, we have flagship vehicles in those regions. I think, again, Chris, the way to think about it is really the way John addressed it, which is we expect -- he's given you a pretty good color on this, a pickup in management fees across the platform throughout the rest of the year.

            "name": "John Redett",
            "content": "Thanks, Harvey. Good morning, everyone. As Harvey said, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve the 2024 financial targets we outlined on last quarter's call.  \n For the first quarter, we generated record FRE of $266 million, nearly 40% higher than the first quarter last year. FRE margin of 47% was also a record and up from 35% in Q1 2023.  \n We produced $431 million in DE or $1.01 in DE per share, our best quarterly DE result since 2022. We finished the first quarter with $425 billion of assets under management, up 12% year-over-year.  \n In the first quarter, we completed the sales of McDonald's China and Neptune Energy, both of which produce attractive returns for LPs and strong performance revenues for our shareholders. Over the past year, we have returned $22 billion in capital to our LPs, highlighting the ability of our investment teams to find liquidity opportunities in difficult and challenging capital markets.  \n We raised $5.3 billion of capital in the quarter and remain confident in achieving our target of $40 billion of inflows for the year.  \n In Solutions, we raised $2.3 billion in the quarter and nearly $14 billion over the last 12 months, as we continue to have success attracting investors to our secondaries and co-investment strategies. And we are starting to see momentum building in our global wealth product, CAPM. In Global Credit, where our CLO platform is one of the largest in the industry, we had an active quarter in a very active market. We priced 7 CLOs, including 3 new issue CLOs. We also saw a strong inflow activity into our global wealth product, CTAC, and continue to see capital raise for our asset-backed finance strategy.  \n And in Global Private Equity, the fundraising environment remains somewhat challenging, but we do see some pockets of strength like real estate in Japan.  \n Management fees totaled $516 million in the first quarter, up about 2% compared to the prior year. We have $15 billion of pending fee-earning AUM that has yet to activate fees. Capital markets activity remains constrained, but it is showing signs of improvement. Transaction and advisory revenues of $27 million increased more than 60% from the first quarter last year.  \n G&A expenses of $80 million were lower compared to the first quarter last year as we benefited from expense discipline and had some onetime items that lowered the quarterly G&A level. We expect G&A expense to shift back towards the recent run rate in the second quarter.  \n Our net accrued carry balance of $2.2 billion declined relative to last quarter due to fund realizations and a relatively lower level of appreciation in our carry funds. And at $6 per share, it remains a substantial source of future earnings.  \n We repurchased 150 million of stock, decreasing our adjusted shares outstanding by 1%. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $1.25 billion, and we remain active buyers of our stock.  \n Wrapping up, we are optimistic about market conditions improving, and we are on track to meet our financial targets for 2024. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Yes. Ken, we have very good momentum in terms of fundraising. We have some products in the market that have real demand. Our secondaries business, our Solutions business, we're seeing real good demand, both in secondaries and co-investment. I would expect that to continue. As we said in the past, we've had good momentum in Japan. We'll be wrapping that one up at some point this year. Real estate is another area where we think we'll have really strong demand. We'll start that fundraise this year as well, and we do expect that to be a successful fundraise. So I would expect to see an acceleration in growth in the fee-paying AUM as well.  \n In terms of the kind of slight decline in fee paying AUM in credit, it was just normal course runoff. And again, the runoff is outside of carry funds. So it was just a small amount of normal course business-as-usual runoff. Alex, it's John. We repurchased 150 million of stock, as I said in my remarks, historically, we've averaged roughly $200 million per year, per annum. So the first quarter was pretty significant relative to what we've done in the past. We still have $1.25 billion left on the share repurchase authorization. And you should just assume we're active purchasers of the stock going forward.  \n In terms of the equity-based comp, this is really -- it got elevated due to the performance stock units we granted to key senior members of our investment teams, our team globally. And these are the people that are driving growth. These are the people that are accountable for growth. And the accounting on these instruments are a bit different. So you're seeing a little bit of elevation from those performance stock unit grants.  \n Remember, these only vest if we have meaningful stock price appreciation. So I think these are very, very shareholder-friendly instruments, great alignment. I would expect the equity-based comp number to start trending down next year. Yes, Brennan, it's John. So look, we really like our CLO business. We're one of the largest in the world. At any given time, we're 1 or 2. Look, this business has great margins. They have a long-term, highly attractive track record. And when you look at kind of credit in the platform, it still looks very, very good. \n Our default rates in our U.S. business are 1/2 of the industry average. The credit stats in Europe are not quite as good as the U.S., but they are still better than European industry averages. So from a credit quality perspective, we feel very good about the credit quality in our CLO business. I mean, look, the first thing I'd say is, Chris, we don't manage the business quarter-to-quarter in terms of performance. I came from the private equity side of the business where I spent 16 years, ran several funds there. I honestly never really focused on quarter-to-quarter performance. I always took a kind of a long-term view, what is the long-term trajectory. So I know you guys focus quarter-to-quarter movement, but we don't really manage the business that way. \n So CP VII was barely in -- carry the previous quarter. It fell out of carry this quarter. So that's the impact you're seeing. But look, we've been in this business, the private equity business, for 35 years. We've generated very strong returns for our LPs, 26% over that period, 2.4x their money. So we're very proud of those returns. \n The only thing I'd tell you is we've always been very, very focused on performance. And not surprisingly, going forward, we will continue to be very focused on performance. Yes. Again, Patrick, what Harvey said, it's very tough to look at fundraising on a quarter-by-quarter basis, stuff slips, stuff moves forward. Again, the fundraising number for the first quarter came in as expected. So that should tell you something in terms of how we think we can get to the $40 billion. We're still confident in the $40 billion. \n And I think Harvey gave you some color around where that fundraising is coming from. We continue to see a lot of interest in our Solutions business, both secondaries, co-investment. In Private Equity, we're going to have some -- we'll have some demand -- strong demand for our real estate product. We have good demand for Japan. In Credit, our asset-backed platform has gone from almost nothing to upsize in 2 years. On the Wealth side, we're really starting to see more momentum in CTAC, CAPM, our solutions wealth product, that's just kind of starting, but getting good momentum. \n So it's really, really across the platform. I wouldn't say one specific segment is an outlier. It's John. I think it's helpful just to kind of level set where we are. We're coming out of a very, very complex environment. And having spent most of my career in private equity, it was one of the more complex environments I've seen. Yet our team has been able to generate $22 billion of realizations through that period in some pretty choppy markets. \n And then I said in my comments, we had a strong quarter in terms of realizations. I noted McDonald's China and Neptune Energy. I know these portfolios really well. I spent a lot of time in that business. I feel good about these portfolios. I also like the momentum we have. So I mean if the markets continue to improve, I would expect that momentum to accelerate. But it's market dependent, obviously. \n In terms of your comments on the IPO markets, I think the IPO markets are kind of open. I know a lot of the bankers and headlines say they're open, but I would say they are opening. Yes. I mean I don't know if I'd quantify in terms of percentage of portfolio. And that stat you alluded to that's 4 years or older, that's really not specific to Carlyle. That's an industry-wide stat. So look, we have a lot of great companies that are ready, we're ready to monetize. We just need markets to continue to improve. We need the IPO markets to really open up. That will be helpful. \n But as I said, if the markets continue to move on the current trajectory, I do expect realization activity to pick up. It's one of the hardest aspects of this business to project. If you could tell me where markets are in 6 months, I could probably give you a very specific answer. I just don't know. But the way it looks today, we're pretty optimistic that realizations will accelerate. Yes, that is our stat, but I think the industry stats are somewhat similar. I don't think we're an outlier at all. Yes, Craig, it's John. Look, we're not concerned with the credit quality stats in the European CLO business. They are elevated relative to the U.S., although I would tell you the U.S. are extremely low. And the credit stats in the European CLO business are still below industry. I think it's important to recognize we've been in this business for 25-plus years. We have a great long-term track record. We have a very deep and talented team leading this investment effort. And over that 25-year period, we have collected 100% of the management fees and the subordinated management fees. I don't think it's far off. It might creep up a little bit. Again, it's -- and we can take this offline. The accounting around the performance stock units is a bit different relative to traditional equity awards, but I don't think it will move up in a material way. I'm happy to take it offline with you and give you details around the accounting."
