A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Ryan Gee, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance for AppLovin. Thank you. You may begin.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Sherry and welcome everyone to AppLovin\u2019s earnings call for the quarter ended December 31st, 2021.

This conference call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our IR website shortly. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Adam.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report record fourth quarter financial results. I\u2019m even more excited by where our software business is heading and our potential in 2022 and beyond. I want to highlight two reasons why we confidently raised our Software revenue outlook for 2022. And why we believe we can grow to approximately $2 billion in Software revenue in 2023. First, the compounding of our Software Platform business exiting 2021. It\u2019s hard to fathom that we have nearly 3 times as many clients using our solution to grow their businesses today versus last year. And our Software Platform revenue was larger in the fourth quarter than for all of 2020 and grew 27% quarter-over-quarter. This marked our third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth and significantly higher growth than all other industry peers. AppDiscovery continues to perform very well and consistently delivers against our clients\u2019 ROI goals. That is why we had over 200% net dollar-based revenue retention for our existing clients, which provides a solid foundation for a robust organic growth rate to persistent \u201822 and beyond. Also consider our Salesforce is still ramping, and that AXON just turned one year old last quarter. Second, the integration of MoPub. We\u2019ve seen amazing progress today integrating MoPub features, publishers and demand partners. The number of apps monetizing with MAX is up over 60% since we announced the deal, and over 90% of the largest publishers for MoPub are actively integrating our unified offering. The AppLovin Exchange will enable many new DSPs and bidders to work with MAX. These demand partners generated the vast majority of MoPub\u2019s revenue, but they didn\u2019t have direct to access to MAX publishers before. As they come online through a unified platform, which will be over twice as big as MoPub, we expect these partnerships to deliver a compelling revenue opportunity in \u201822 and beyond. We believe to operate a fast-growing business successfully over the long-term. We need to be executing against our current opportunities, and also be building products that can be catalysts for growth years into the future. I\u2019m very proud of our team, because in addition to executing on all of our current initiatives, we\u2019re building products in big markets, such as blockchain and NFTs for mobile content, marketing solutions for mobile OEMs and carriers, and enabling performance marketing in the fast-growing CTV market. These categories have similarities to the business and technologies we\u2019ve already built, and success in any one of these can meaningfully expand our business. We look forward to sharing our progress on these initiatives and others as they develop. With that, let me turn it over to Herald to provide color on our numbers and outlook.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam and thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us. As Adam noted, we had a very solid Q4 and an outstanding 2021. In 2021, we not only had great financial results, our revenue grew more than 90% and adjusted EBITDA grew more than 100%, we\u2019re able to fully ramp our AXON Machine Learning platform, build critical mass in our first-party apps, complete strategic acquisitions in both tech and content, access to public equity markets and private debt markets, and importantly, build out our Global Team and Board. This positions our company well for future growth. Instead of reading our financial and operating metrics for Q4 and 2021, which are well laid out in our earnings release and shareholder letter, I do want to highlight our outlook for \u201822 and Software targets for 2023. First, we plan to grow our scaled software business at over 100% for 2022. We\u2019re projecting Software Platform revenue for 2022 at just over $1.4 billion at the midpoint of our range, representing 111% year-over-year growth. This is a sizable upward revision from $1 billion dollar target we gave you earlier in 2021. Our outlook for continued robust growth stems from one, our strong finish to 2021 and record Q4 \u201821 results, setting us up well for organic growth in 2022. And two, as Adam mentioned already, our outlook benefits from the solid progress integrating MoPub into MAX. Well going forward, we won\u2019t be reporting on MoPub\u2019s standalone, since it is being fully integrated into the MAX platform. We continue to believe the MoPub acquisition should be a highly accretive and strategically impactful investment for our company in the near-term and over the long-term, as evidenced by our software guidance for \u201822 and \u201823 which I\u2019ll come to in a second. I do want to call out that we expect to pay approximately $200 million in migration fees to publishers coming on to the MAX platform, mostly in the first quarter. Given these costs related to the MoPub transaction, we plan to add back a substantial part \u2013 portion of that amount to our adjusted EBITDA. Post the MoPub acquisition, we would not be adding back those fees in the ordinary course. With regard to our \u201823 outlook for Software, given all the progress we made to-date and the many opportunities we see ahead, we\u2019re working hard to reach the $2 billion of Software revenue in 2023 as Adam mentioned. On the Apps side, our outlook is for $2.2 billion in 2022 at the midpoint of our range. It is amazing to say we had \u2013 negligible Apps revenue just four years ago and now have a multibillion dollar business with \u2013 an awesome set of studios and developers around the globe. While we reached critical mass to drive first-party data. The first-party data we need for our Machine Learning engine, we are continuing to make substantial investments in new content, and are planning to release new first-party apps with evergreen potential over the next several quarters. The midpoint of our outlook at $2.2 billion assumes modest revenue from new content. Given the inherent difficulty in projecting new content performance. To project our new apps and having more meaningful impact in the second half of \u201822. Note, that if we do have a new hit title, we would ramp our user acquisition to drive revenue as we did with Project Makeover over the last year. As it relates to our EBITDA for \u201822, we\u2019re targeting an adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 20s percent range up from 21% at 26%. Well, Adam and I are focused on compounding free cash flow over the long-term, we are and will invest for the long-term value creation rather than near-term profitability. Lastly and importantly, Adam, Ryan and I would like to thank you for your support in 2021 and please know that we and our AppLovin team are working hard to deliver for all of you in \u201822 and beyond. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you so much. So Herald, just a couple of follow-up on the migration costs of $200 million for 2022. And it looks like there was about $3 million or thereabouts for the fourth quarter. So, you know can you discuss what this expense actually entails? And to your point, I guess changing mediation platforms are pretty rare. So can you talk about what\u2019s actually going on underneath the hood in terms of the nuts and bolts of the migration? And Adam, undoubtedly you\u2019ve seen sort of the latest privacy-driven changes that Google was talking about, you know for Android? So, you know can you talk about how things might be the same? Or how things might be different versus what Apple did on iOS? Thanks.\nHerald Chen: Hey, Stephen, thanks for the question. You know historically as we said in the mediation space, there\u2019s been little volatility and people wants to run a platform stay there, because it is inherently integrated to all the applications were very, very sticky. And historically, we\u2019ve not paid these fees in the past. For the acquisition of MoPub and MoPub being shut down as a service at the end of \u2013 end of this quarter, a lot of publishers needed to move quickly. And there\u2019s quite a bit of cost to them, actually from a revenue standpoint where they potentially can lose revenue, given the speed with which they need to migrate. And there\u2019s just cost to \u2013 to get the migration done. And so we negotiate these one-time fees to cover those costs.\nAdam Foroughi: Hey, Stephen it\u2019s Adam. On your second question around Google\u2019s announced privacy changes, a couple of things there. One is, we don\u2019t know exactly the direction these changes will take, is the multiyear plan and Google works with all the major companies in the sector to ensure that there\u2019s not a disruption of performance on advertising, targeting and attribution. And then, pairs that with better privacy environment for the consumer. So it\u2019s just going to take a while to develop. That said, we obviously dealt with IDFA changes coming really quickly to the market in 2021. And you saw our business grow quite considerably on the Software side in \u201821. Going into the changes, we talked about the privacy change on Apple being muted for our business. You saw us growing 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q2, you saw the same trend in Q3 and Q4. So our business is growing quite quickly. And these changes actually in a way do benefit us, because the core of our data that drives our machine learning is all first-party data achieved and accessed from our own game. So, we believe we\u2019re set up very well to perform, regardless of any sort of privacy changes, the \u2013 regulatory changes of the ecosystem.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thank you, Adam or Herald, you know can you maybe walk through what\u2019s embedded in your guide for expense growth in 2022? Your outlook I think has $750 million of Software growth at the midpoint. And I know some of that is MoPub, which has a higher expense \u2013 initially. But just trying to understand if your expectation for incremental margins on the underlying Software business has changed at all?\nHerald Chen: Thanks for the question, David, it\u2019s Herald. So, yeah overall we think the acquisition of MoPub you know with billion dollars we paid in this incremental, couple of million dollars to get publishers migrated is a highly accretive as mentioned strategic deal for us, and we do feel very good about that. And we do think the flow through on the Software side margin structure is high, there is as you note, more infrastructure to be built and as we\u2019re scaling and doubling the size of our Software business, you know we\u2019re having to keep up with that for sure. And we\u2019re bringing on you know a lot of new DSPs and a lot of new publishers simultaneously. I think for our guide for the year, maybe just taking a bigger picture look at it. In the high 20s EBITDA margin. As mentioned, we want to be investing for growth in the business and we think our ability to continue to grow the business over the long-term at scale you know requires that investments. So we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re trying to include what we think are some new projects in that EBITDA number, we are investing quite a bit into our studios as well. I think you \u2013 you know that we acquired a number of studios at the end of last year, we\u2019re scaling the investment into those studios to ensure that they\u2019ve got the right resources to deliver content on the back end. So we can certainly drive the business in a different direction in terms of overall margin, given their flow through but you know, we \u2013 there\u2019s so many opportunities for us to invest both on Software and Apps, where we\u2019d like to invest in both of them.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then \u2013 Adam in your prepared remarks you mentioned some areas for investment, like marketing solutions for OEM or blockchain. Just wondering if you could expand on this, are there \u2013 are there investment costs against that in 2022? And if you can you know provide any specific details you know, why are these the right opportunities to invest in?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So when we look at anything that\u2019s new, we do that incremental to what our current opportunities are. But we do want them to be related to the expertise that we have, both in terms of technology platform, audience and data, so that we have a higher likelihood of success if we do invest in something. And so, the three areas I mentioned, the carrier and OEM space, marketing solutions to really enable manufacturers to generate more from their device sales than they currently generate from the solutions they have available, is something that\u2019s a natural extension of our machine learning demand in Software Platform. The NFT and blockchain marketplace and solutions there are just incremental ways to help monetize mobile gamers. And we\u2019ve got 200 million of them playing our games and then across our audience network, we accessed 2 billion of them every single month. And so because of our penetration of the mobile ecosystem, we think helping enable developers to expand their monetization opportunity with solutions there is beneficial to all parts of our business, so it makes sense to invest there. And then finally, the connected TV space, very similar to what we do today, we\u2019re serving full-screen immersive video advertisements on mobile devices and extending that and the performance models to TV is a new and fast-growing digital access point for content, feels like a natural extension for our \u2013 of our platform. All of these are covered in the guidance that we\u2019ve given you in terms of costs, if any of them hit and \u2013 and frankly, hitting on a new business is always hard. But these are so related to what we do, that if any of them hit it dramatically widens and expands our market opportunity and growth opportunities for years to come, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing there.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please proceed.\nTim Nollen: Hi, everyone. Thanks very much. I\u2019d like to ask about the kind of the components of the Software Platform growth if I could. So you know you had very, very, very strong growth, especially in Q2 and Q3 and really kind of building up from AXON you know rolling on to the to the \u2013 to be a contributor to that service starting you know, a year ago, which as you mentioned, you\u2019ve now lapped against. So not surprising that, that rate of growth has slowed from those super high rates in Q2 and Q3. I\u2019m just wondering in Q4, if you can give us an idea like what was an organic versus an AXON related figure if that\u2019s possible to do? And then looking ahead to the \u201822 guidance, nice big number there, is it possible to give us an update on what the MoPub contribution would be to that versus any AXON versus any other \u2013 any other elements? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Hey, Tim. On the first part of \u2013 do you want to \u2013 I\u2019ll handle the first part, Herald, do you want to jump in on the second? So, on the first part, our Software business is pretty much all organic, really adjust was the only material acquisition we\u2019d had before we announced closing MoPub in January. And in Q4, we saw a 27% quarter-over-quarter growth. Obviously, the numbers are getting bigger each quarter and yet the quarter-over-quarter growth is much higher than anything \u2013 anyone sees in the industry on the Software side, and is kept up. And what we\u2019re seeing even though AXON is maturing, and we lapped the prior years\u2019 numbers with AXON, is that, advertisers who are using our solution are investing more dollars every single quarter into the platform, because as data builds and they can validate that the performance results are very strong, they want more of \u2013 more of it. And that\u2019s why you saw a huge step up in dollars per SPEC in the quarter. And we expect to continue to see AXON improve over time, because these machine learning systems as they get more data and they get more scale benefit from that and become more and more accurate on behalf of the customers that are using it. Going forward, MoPub presents an opportunity for \u2013 for a continued expansion, more access to demand and then obviously a large expansion of access to audience on our marketing platform, MAX. And MoPub as of \u2013 as of last year, had a very strong year. And then coming into January, it was doing very well. But it is going to be completely rolled into our solution, we\u2019re going to take those demand partners, the DSPs and advertisers that were buying through MoPub to gain access to the MoPub audience. And we\u2019re integrating them into our MAX solution to give them direct access to the unified offering, which is now going to be over twice as big as MoPub was. So we think that\u2019s going to present an opportunity to create revenue growth from that access point for possibly years to come. And we\u2019re very optimistic about the \u2013 the acquisition, because we\u2019ve seen so little churn, as mentioned, 90% plus, of all top publishers are migrating over to our platform. Now, I\u2019ll hand it off to Herald for the second part.\nHerald Chen: Yeah, Tim, I think a lot of the foundational growth drivers Adam mentioned there you know for \u201822 look, we have a great organic business and you know quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4, right that was 28% increase, which is all organic, right. That\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s a pretty big move. Rolling into \u201822 then, we have you know the AppDiscovery continue to improve with underlying AXON, we also have Adjust you know doing well and good SaaS business growing at the rate you know rates that we\u2019d hoped. As mentioned, it\u2019s difficult then to parse out you know the impact of MoPub and MAX and exactly how that lays out. I know previously, we gave a number that the run rate of \u2013 of MoPub you know would be in the mid to 100s by the end of the year. We still remain you know very confident in that and frankly probably there\u2019s upside to that. One important note was, we did give guidance on that, that revenue the way we did, because it takes time to ramp, as mentioned before, migrate from one mediation platform to another, one, to get the publishers to migrate, and then to get the demand side to migrate. And so we\u2019re going through that process now as you know, but the impact of that in terms of the actual revenue booked in the year, therefore, you know it will be less than the [$250 million] [ph], it\u2019s more of a $250 million run rate was the target. When we announced the deal now that we\u2019re well into it, you know we feel very good about that number as well. So that led us to you know what is, I guess not a small range in terms of Software target at the high end of 15 \u2013 at $1.5 billion midpoint just over $1.4 billion. And then, where you can really see the impact overall you know is the guide to our target of you know trying to hit the $2 billion number in \u201823 just goes to the fact that we\u2019ve got you know a lot of confidence in putting these things together. And then the ecosystem building around that you know should allow us to drive pretty significant growth for this year and next.\nTim Nollen: Thanks. And if I could just follow-up quickly, I think last quarter you gave us some indication of the Adjust contribution to revenues. Is there a similar type of number you can give us now?\nHerald Chen: Yeah, just when we acquired it was around $100 million and \u2013 and it\u2019s growing at a solid double-digit rate. We\u2019ll continue to do that. You know we think for \u201822 and \u201823 as well.\nTim Nollen: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. Just one quick question. You guys have done so much M&A and been you know very successful doing it. I just wonder as you sort of look at the landscape, do you feel like most of this sort of acquisitions that behind you, and it\u2019s now more about investing organically in the assets that you have? Or do you think there are other sort of interesting assets that you could \u2013 you could plug into your existing portfolio? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Hey, Jason it\u2019s Adam, and thanks for the question. So, three years ago when we got into gaming, we made it strategic and focused, and obviously gaming, super fragmented. But it became strategic to us, because we wanted to accumulate content across every single category of gaming, so that we can have that data to feed into the Software Platform and execute on \u2013 on obviously, what you\u2019re seeing for a lot of our numbers today. We\u2019ve checked the box on gaming. So we\u2019ve got enough of a gaming business and enough audience and data, that the Software business can do its thing. And obviously as you\u2019ve seen this year, the exceptional growth of the Software business proves that. And then in the last year, we announced two material Software acquisitions, which we think strengthened our current offering. And obviously, we\u2019re in the middle of integrating those. So that\u2019ll take us forward on an organic basis for quite some time on current initiatives. Then, when we look at new initiatives, what we really think about is, is there a possible acquisition to go do to accelerate our ability to extend our platform, our audience and our data to something new in those categories that I talked about in my script. And \u2013 and then separately, when we look at those new categories, we wonder like, shall we build and so that build versus buy decision is always going to be one that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s top of mind. But I would say what\u2019s strategic for us now is a lot different than what\u2019s been strategic for us the last few years as we went through a whole bunch of acquisitions to get that data intact to power the Software business to become what it has to the market-leading platform.\nJason Bazinet: Okay, so enough 1-P data, but maybe something on the NFT or blockchain side from an M&A standpoint, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Please proceed.\nClark Lampen: Hi, guys. Good evening. I\u2019ve got one on the Software business. As we\u2019re thinking about I guess Software segment performance, not only in \u201822. But you know years past that \u201823 and beyond. Can you remind us you know you may have just answered this, Adam, but how does the gaming portfolio sort of affect you know Software growth in concert with one another? Does the incremental swing you know whether it\u2019s positive or negative with the gaming business meaningfully impact you know your ability to continue growing or achieving those out your targets? And then separately on the margin outlook for \u2013 for \u201822 \u2013 excuse me, for \u2013 for asking you that question. I just want to confirm that the $200 million of migration costs associated with MoPub is embedded within that high 20s margin outlook? Is that correct or incorrect?\nAdam Foroughi: I let Herald answer part two, maybe first, because I think it\u2019s quick. And then I\u2019ll answer part one.\nHerald Chen: We\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re going to add back a substantial part of that $200 million to adjusted EBITDA, and therefore that is excluded in \u2013 in the guidance at the high 20s margin.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. On the first part really what you\u2019re asking about is like, how important is gaming and gaming growth to the Software growth. And what really what we knew going in as we built out this machine learning system is, these types of Software solutions are built on having really good data, and then being able to extend that data into predictive lookalikes across the whole audience. And we\u2019ve got 200 million monthly active users and 2 billion that we see across the platform. And that ratio is working really well for us today. Longer-term, and we\u2019ve said this repeatedly over the last year, we\u2019re not a games company, we\u2019re a software company really helping our partners grow. And as you look at our Software revenue, it\u2019s expanded dramatically. On the game side, the vast majority of our user acquisition span, which is the core driver of gaming growth is on our own platform. But as we continue to expand our relationships on the Software side, and really get more dollars from third-parties, we\u2019re going to take the third-party reported revenue number and converge it with that TSTV number, because we expect our Software platform to be able to grow much faster than our desire to spend on user acquisition on the games\u2019 portfolio, because we already have the data that we need to power the Software platform. So, you\u2019ll see our focus is going to be to continue to expand the dollars that third-parties are paying us on the Software side, whether it\u2019s through MAX, whether it\u2019s through the demand side relationships that we\u2019re going to inherit through MoPub or the vast majority of the revenue, the direct relationships with advertisers buying on a performance basis on our platform.\nClark Lampen: Got it. And, Adam, is there a vertical you know sort of adjacent to gaming that you guys would sort of like to attack you know next, I guess does it feel comfortable that you have you know a solid business and a solid assortment of first-party data there is there \u2013 is there something that I guess just sort of is at the top of your focus?\nAdam Foroughi: You know we\u2019ve talked about this before, the nice thing about gaming data is that, it expands to other markets. And we\u2019re seeing non-gaming is a fast growth sector in our business. And we\u2019ve seen it over the last year. And if you think about the data, what data do we collect today, what is the first-party data? Well, if someone pays $50 in the last week in a game like Project Makeover, that tells you a lot about that person, but they\u2019re not only playing Project Makeover, and they\u2019re not only playing games, they\u2019re doing a lot more than that. They might be in the shopping apps, they might be in the fashion design app, they might be in the home design app, food delivery, et cetera. And our systems can figure that out with the datasets that we have. So, expansion across vertical to other app categories is something that we\u2019ve been excited about, we\u2019re seeing traction with and we continue to be excited about going forward.\nClark Lampen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Please proceed.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you, good afternoon. I had a question about MAX and all the new publishers that coming on Board. So would it be fair to say that there are some publishers that only use mediation and there are some that use mediation and real-time bidding to monetize their inventory? So my question is, number one, do you try to steer publishers towards one or the other option? And if yes or no, why? And then my second question is about the take rate. I understand that the take \u2013 you only have the take rate for the real-time bidding auctions. But how do you see that going forward? Do you \u2013 do you expect it to be stable? Do you \u2013 do you think it can go up? Are you prepared to \u2013 to seek a contraction and there so I would appreciate your thoughts on this.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So \u2013 so couple of things embedded in there. When we launched MAX, we did it because we wanted to facilitate real-time bidding to the marketplace quicker. And we \u2013 fundamentally we believe that the ad ecosystem should be traded in real-time, it\u2019s no different than a stock trading floor that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s gone programmatic over the last 20 years. And when it becomes real-time, it enables companies with a data advantage and a technology advantage to win their share of inventory, and make whatever margins they deserve to make, but it maximizes truly the dollars that the publisher earns. So today, MAX is the furthest ahead in the marketplace, delivering that real-time bidding to the publisher and to the end consumer to get that best ad out there on the device. It is a hybrid solution, it\u2019s bidding plus mediation, and we get paid when companies bid on MAX, they pay per seat on our marketplace, we don\u2019t with mediation. So over time, MAX\u2019s economics continue to improve. Now, we wanted to facilitate bidding, we are a bidder on MAX, we\u2019ve been a bidder in the marketplace for a couple of years, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re very good at it. Obviously, you\u2019ve seen the growth of our Software business expand dramatically. But we don\u2019t target a specific take rate from any of the ads we serve. If we can make a penny on the dollar, we\u2019re making an extra dollar \u2013 an extra penny of revenue. And we\u2019re reporting to on a net revenue basis. This is the one thing that\u2019s important to understand when we talk about \u2013 about our revenue this past quarter or even we\u2019re talking about $2 billion of Software revenue in \u201823. That\u2019s net revenue reported Software revenue. So it\u2019s exceptionally high margin, the cost to the publisher have already been taken out of the dollars that the advertiser passed. So really, any sort of constriction on take rate doesn\u2019t impact at all what we\u2019re going to report to you, because we\u2019re not operating, afraid of that today. And we\u2019re seeing continued growth in that Software business. And we\u2019re very confident about the continued growth of it going into \u201822 and \u201823.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Please proceed.\nRalph Schackart: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the Apps side of the business as it relates to the 2022 guide, I think $2.2 billion, $2.3 \u2013 $2.5 billion in revs. You talked about modest revenue contribution from new content. And I think more so contribution in the second half of the year. But any color you could add or help us think about how the relative growth rate of the Consumer Apps might compare or different versus the business apps you know was a conservatism on the consumer side or was it more broad-based?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah, so we \u2013 go ahead, Herald, do you want to \u2013 do you want to jump in?\nHerald Chen: Sure. I was going to say like, we don\u2019t operate the games as Business Apps or Consumer Apps. They\u2019re just games and apps, and they monetize with IP plus ads. So a lot of these \u2013 these products are hybrid. They\u2019re making money from advertisement to users, and then some users will pay within the games for content as well. Fundamentally though like, again, we\u2019ve said this a lot of times, we\u2019re not a games company. The games serve a purpose for us in our business. We\u2019ve gotten them to scale $2 billion plus business, which was great. More importantly, we\u2019re getting data first-party on 200 million monthly active users. And the games and growth in the games are driven strictly by what we\u2019re spending on user acquisition. That\u2019s what drives mobile gaming businesses outside of \u2013 of acquisitions and M&A, which we haven\u2019t done recently in the games business, and are less inclined to do so now that we have the data that we needed. So as you think about what matters to us in our business, we\u2019re talking about Software, software growth, we\u2019re one of the fastest-growing Software businesses on the face of the planet today, scaling this business to a couple of billion dollars next year. And that\u2019s important, because today we report to you that TSTV number, which is a lot bigger than the Software reported revenue we give you. That delta is a spend for own games on our own platform. Well as our Software business goes from where it is, and \u2013 and we talked coming into this year, $1 billion dollar is projected for this year, we just raised that up 40%, and are now talking about $2 billion next year. As that continues to grow, that\u2019s all going to be dollars from third-parties, we\u2019re not going to be able to double the amount that we\u2019re spending on our current games, because they just don\u2019t justify that kind of expansion. And so you\u2019ll see the third-party number converge with that TSTV number. And that gives us a lot of room to grow, the dollars we\u2019re collecting and the margins that we\u2019re able to make from the business while focusing on what we care about, which is Software, not necessarily the games part of our business.\nRalph Schackart: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Pang with Stifel. Please proceed.\nDavid Pang: Great. Thanks, everyone. Just one little follow-up on the in-app bidding question. Could you talk about what portion of the ad transactions on MAX was in that bidding? And how should we think about that mix changing over the next few years with the addition of MoPub? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So in the past, obviously a couple of years ago, when we launched MAX the market had no bidding, we\u2019ve gotten MAX to probably half bidding at this point. And we expect by the end of the year, the vast majority will be bid real-time. MoPub allows us to access MoPub demand, which is more of exchange-based demand. Real-time bidding is, it takes two forms. One is, from header bidding networks. These are companies such as ourselves, Facebook was one of the first adopters of bidding, so think the platforms with SDKs. And then there\u2019s another aspect to the market, which is Demand Side Platforms or DSPs. They plug into exchanges to use someone else\u2019s SDK to access the audience and bid in real-time as well. With MoPub, we\u2019re unifying the demand side bidders that are \u2013 are ad networks traditionally part of, as well as the DSPs into one unified marketplace, one unified real-time auction. And so bringing those DSPs live through our access point to this massive audience on MAX plus MoPub, is what we\u2019re excited about, that drove MoPub\u2019s revenue, the platform itself unified is over twice as big as MoPub ever was. And so that gives us a lot of access to growth in these demand side partnerships as they come online.\nDavid Pang: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.\nMartin Yang: Hi, thank you for taking my question. First question is on your natural extension on the recent initiatives. Can you clarify, are you providing Software solutions to the non-gaming apps? Or are you thinking about publishing non-gaming apps yourself or both?\nAdam Foroughi: I don\u2019t think we spoke about non-gaming apps, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re focused on building Software Platform technologies for these bigger markets. Connected TV is obviously one, we think performance marketing, and an extension of our current demand in data into the connected TV world can be very impactful. When it comes to blockchain and NFTs, both for gaming and non-gaming, if we can help facilitate the ability for users to engage with content, and really take ownership over that content through our Software Platform and our relationships, we think we can expand the monetization opportunity in mobile apps, which is very impactful for all of our partners than ourselves. And then lastly, we talked about taking our marketing solutions, machine learning and demand and enabling carriers and device manufacturers to generate more from the handsets that they sell to the consumer by doing partnerships with our platform. And so those are the three big areas that we\u2019re really focused on all software-centric.\nMartin Yang: So some question is really referring back to your comment on checking the box on gaming. But there are \u2013 there are still pretty substantial \u2013 in-app marketing and advertising opportunities in non-gaming apps. So would you do something similar for to obtain the first-party data from non-gaming apps if you orient yourself a solution to other publishers that are not game \u2013 game publishers?\nAdam Foroughi: So I got you there. I think the answer is no for the reason I gave you before which is, we\u2019ve got so much first-party data now, when you know someone paid the $50 in Project Makeover, you know a lot of things about them. And one other things you know for certain, just \u2013 just conceptually we know as human beings, that person doesn\u2019t only play Project Makeover 24 hours a day, they do a lot of other things. If they\u2019ve got $200 a month to play \u2013 spend in a fashion design game, they\u2019re probably spending a lot of money on fashion ecommerce apps, food delivery apps, rideshare apps, a whole bunch of other things that had the household tend to invest in, and the machine learning can figure that out and enable non-gaming companies to market through our platform too and we\u2019ve talked about the category as \u2013 as being a fast-growing category, it\u2019s still not a big part of our business. So we don\u2019t talk about it broken out. But it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re excited about, because we\u2019ve already seen success in. The other part of that \u2013 that\u2019s important is a lot of the non-gaming spend that happens in mobile and then just on digital, in general, comes from demand side platforms. The big demand side platforms, omni-channel, where agencies will spend dollars through are not an area that we had any exposure to in our business prior to MoPub. As we integrate these MoPub partnerships into our unified offering, and give them access to over twice as much of the eyeballs, we expect to see a lot of dollars flow through our platform direct to the consumer from those types of advertisers as well, which would qualify as non-gaming.\nMartin Yang: Got it. I have another logistic questions, if I may. Is there any migration fees you expect after 1Q22?\nAdam Foroughi: No, really like \u2013 look our business long-term may have some sort of nominal migration fees, we\u2019ve had them in a nominal way in the past, the big amount in the quarter is specifically for MoPub publishers switching off of a platform that just going to go offline. One of the big issues of the platform that goes offline which really doesn\u2019t happen, this is a decade old Software Platform, is that, in the mobile app ecosystem, you can either update an app or not update an app, and a lot of old devices are set not to update. And so a lot of these publishers tend to lose an annuity value of revenue on users that choose not to update, and then MoPub is going to go offline. So they\u2019re no longer going to be able to advertise to those customers. And you just cross off a stream of revenue. And so we\u2019re taking this fund to make that not a problem for these publishers, because ultimately we looked at the MoPub deal is access to publishers, and the demand side, it was a very cost effective deal for us. But we \u2013 we didn\u2019t want the publishers to lose in the middle of that transaction. So we\u2019re covering the cost of that loss annuity due to the quick shutdown of this platform. And that ends up being a very unique case related to this acquisition, which is something you just don\u2019t tend to see in technology where a huge platform goes offline.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe the first one is \u2013 is for you, Adam. You\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times basically, if I\u2019m interpreting it correctly, this idea of once you have the data in place and you feed it into AXON, there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a lot that you can do with it. And so I guess I just want to understand, does that mean that when you reach a certain audience side in terms of your portfolio \u2013 audience size in terms of your portfolio of apps that, that yields an update on an ongoing basis that you can do what you need to do with it, you don\u2019t need to keep scaling the app portfolio beyond a certain point you know because you maintain 200 million MAUs and have all the data that you need, I guess, what do you mean by that? And \u2013 and then I have a follow-up.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah, that\u2019s 100% right. That\u2019s why we \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about for \u2013 for the last year like, the games business may grow, it may not grow, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s scaled enough where it\u2019s fueling the massive growth in the Software business. And so you sort of have today 10% actual data, we have perfect data on our own apps. And then 90% is predicted lookalikes. Being at a scale that we\u2019re at today with the technologies and data platform and machine learning and algorithms that we built, you\u2019re obviously seeing a Software Platform that\u2019s growing much, much faster than any other platform in our industry. And so you can tell that \u2013 that \u2013 the 10x ratio of lookalikes to actual data works. Now, if we can get data on 2 billion mobile devices, we would take it, actual data is always better than lookalikes, but we know that it\u2019s exceptionally hard to go scale a platform to get that much direct first-party data, there \u2013 there\u2019s maybe only one company in the history of the world that\u2019s gotten that much scale to consumers, right. But we\u2019ve proven that at 200 million, we\u2019re very, very good on the Software side. So we\u2019re excited with where we\u2019re at on the data side of this business.\nMatthew Cost: Great, thank you. And then maybe this one\u2019s for Herald. Just thinking about like the growth in SPECs over the course of this year. I think excluding Adjust, you guys added around 40 plus a little over 40 million \u2013 sorry, not 40 million, 40 specs in 2Q and 3Q. And I think that that number, if I have it right, it was about 7 in 4Q. So I guess again, excluding Adjust what are kind of the dynamics behind SPEC adds over the course of this year? Thanks.\nHerald Chen: Yeah, thanks, Matt for the questions. Yeah, again the Software business as you \u2013 as you know, has grown you know tremendously over the course of the year, and we\u2019re projecting it to continue to do that. And you know, we gave the SPEC number to try to give a little more granularity into the bill you know price volume wise. What aspect, and of course, it\u2019s grown considerably you know price volume more in the fourth quarter in terms of people scaling quite rapidly, in particular, ex Adjust to $757,000 in the quarter. So a pretty significant amount of money of increase. What \u2013 what was slower in that period was the actual SPEC count. And that\u2019s really due to the fact that in the third quarter, we \u2013 we added a lot of SPECs that we\u2019re testing and whatnot, and didn\u2019t add as many of those in the fourth quarter. So we still \u2013 feel very good about the \u2013 the customer growth, obviously with all the migrating customers from MoPub. Again, it\u2019ll be hard to distinguish you know who\u2019s a MAX customer who\u2019s a MoPub customer, because it\u2019s all going to be MAX customers, we were highly confident in the Software line growing and therefore you know price quantity has to follow that. One footnote to that, and it isn\u2019t in our letter, but didn\u2019t want to highlight it, just wanted to keep things clear for this. In our letter on the upfront side, we kept the SPEC numbers the same. One very detailed point is our SPEC definition was based on a run rate per quarter, they had to get to $125,000, of run rate in the quarter. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to report that metric for a little bit. But we\u2019re really going to go focus more on an LTM basis to have $125,000 of revenue. The reason I point that out is, that\u2019ll get rid of some of the volatility that is inherent if you use just a quarterly run rate number of SPECs coming and going, and given the scale of the customers we\u2019re talking about. We think that\u2019ll be a much \u2013 much better metric going forward.\nMatthew Cost: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi, thank you. How would the open app markets act as currently written affect your business strategically? And are you playing any role direct or indirect? And have the laws being written?\nAdam Foroughi: I will be honest, I\u2019m reading up on what the law is right now. Can you give us a little insight into specifically what you\u2019re talking about? And then I\u2019ll answer it?\nOmar Dessouky: Yeah. So you know, I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s pretty well known that major players that own platforms are able to advantage themselves in certain ways or at least that\u2019s the view of some market participants. And you know, it appears that legal interests are potentially going to try to make it a more competitive industry. And I\u2019m just wondering, you know what you guys think of that and you know how it might reshuffle the \u2013 potentially the attribution ecosystem or \u2013 or the actual targeting ecosystem itself in your favor or not?\nAdam Foroughi: Got it. And this is, you\u2019re talking about like the \u2013 the actual operating systems, the App Store tax and any other rule changes they make that \u2013 that could be seen as benefiting themselves, is that what you\u2019re talking about?\nOmar Dessouky: Yeah. Yes.\nAdam Foroughi: So \u2013 so the App Store \u2013 App Store fees obviously, they\u2019re not going up. And \u2013 I think a lot of people are hopeful that alternatives can be introduced or the actual tax on the app store goes down. Overall, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re in a good position because, one, our Apps business is paying a hefty amount in the 30% every single year. But more importantly, these types of added competition to the marketplace make the pricing that goes to the end developer stronger. And so if that happens, you sort of take \u2013 if $1 becomes $0.70 today and say, and tomorrow it becomes $0.85, that\u2019s 20% more LTV that advertisers can go spend on a platform like ours. So \u2013 that would just immediately mean in a competitive marketplace like ours that you see a step function up in terms of the dollars that companies are willing to spend to go acquire new users, because they have those kinds of economics that they get in their favor. When it comes to other rule changes, the platforms do provide an immense amount of value. So we operate within the \u2013 the rules of the platforms and we can\u2019t predict where they go. The competition is always good for these ecosystems. And I think when we look at this, we know that we\u2019re one of the leaders in the market on the Apps side. And we\u2019re undoubtedly the largest advertising platform Apps side of the Facebook\u2019s and the Google\u2019s on mobile today that exists independent. And so we\u2019re set up really well to benefit from some of this disintermediation that might happen added competition and better economics for the content creators.\nOperator: Our final question is from Franco Granda with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.\nFranco Granda: Hi, everyone, this \u2013 yeah thanks for taking my questions here. Just following up on an early question, I was hoping you could speak about your progress in non-gaming revenues on your Software Platform. You know what was the growth rate of non-gaming revenues in \u201821? And then, you know now that MoPub has closed and you\u2019re integrating it, what does not mix look like?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, that\u2019s not something that we break out yet. But I\u2019ll say really the \u2013 the area that\u2019s a big opportunity is, both that direct app marketer on our platform getting access to more through just Salesforce bringing more non-gaming customers into our ecosystem as we\u2019ve touched on, but more importantly something we haven\u2019t talked on, that I referenced earlier is, you end up with these omni-channel DSPs, trade desk obviously being a famous one. But there\u2019s very big companies here that route, non-gaming demand, specifically agency and brand dollars into mobile applications. With the MAX plus MoPub unified platform, we\u2019ve got the biggest supply side platform that the mobile app ecosystems ever seen in one place, we\u2019re the \u2013 we\u2019re the direct access to the consumer. And these agencies and those omni-channel DSPs are really going through this \u2013 this shift in mindset to try to optimize supply costs. So they get direct to the consumer. Well, they\u2019re going to be able to do it through our platform at massive amounts of scale now as they go and integrate into the MAX marketplace directly through us. And we think that\u2019s going to facilitate a lot of dollars in non-gaming to move into our ecosystem, which will be to the benefit of our publishing partners, but also to the benefit of us as the trading floor.\nFranco Granda: All right. Thanks, Adam. And then as it relates to some of the new opportunities in the Software side that you talked about such as NFTs and CTV. I was curious about your approach there. Are you approaching talent from you know their respective industries? Or are you moving resources from within the company to help you go about those strategies?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah, I mean, look, when we look at a new business, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re actually, all of our core team has been here for since we started the business a decade ago. And so we\u2019re very entrepreneurial. And the best new business is always to start with a few people that put together an idea and if it sticks in a hit, it can \u2013 it can really expand. Now, that\u2019s a traditional startup, we have advantages with our scale data platform or algorithms and the demand access and data access that we have. And so we picked categories where our relationships and our technologies will give us an advantage to help start. We\u2019re an entrepreneurial so we\u2019re building a lot of the core technologies ourselves. So we will look to buy potentially, if it makes sense. We\u2019ll also look to staff from the Apps side and \u2013 and in particular, with a couple of these businesses, we brought people from the Apps side to come in and run these businesses for us to give us even more confidence in executing them over the coming years.\nFranco Granda: All right, thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude our conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report record fourth quarter financial results. I\u2019m even more excited by where our software business is heading and our potential in 2022 and beyond. I want to highlight two reasons why we confidently raised our Software revenue outlook for 2022. And why we believe we can grow to approximately $2 billion in Software revenue in 2023. First, the compounding of our Software Platform business exiting 2021. It\u2019s hard to fathom that we have nearly 3 times as many clients using our solution to grow their businesses today versus last year. And our Software Platform revenue was larger in the fourth quarter than for all of 2020 and grew 27% quarter-over-quarter. This marked our third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth and significantly higher growth than all other industry peers. AppDiscovery continues to perform very well and consistently delivers against our clients\u2019 ROI goals. That is why we had over 200% net dollar-based revenue retention for our existing clients, which provides a solid foundation for a robust organic growth rate to persistent \u201822 and beyond. Also consider our Salesforce is still ramping, and that AXON just turned one year old last quarter. Second, the integration of MoPub. We\u2019ve seen amazing progress today integrating MoPub features, publishers and demand partners. The number of apps monetizing with MAX is up over 60% since we announced the deal, and over 90% of the largest publishers for MoPub are actively integrating our unified offering. The AppLovin Exchange will enable many new DSPs and bidders to work with MAX. These demand partners generated the vast majority of MoPub\u2019s revenue, but they didn\u2019t have direct to access to MAX publishers before. As they come online through a unified platform, which will be over twice as big as MoPub, we expect these partnerships to deliver a compelling revenue opportunity in \u201822 and beyond. We believe to operate a fast-growing business successfully over the long-term. We need to be executing against our current opportunities, and also be building products that can be catalysts for growth years into the future. I\u2019m very proud of our team, because in addition to executing on all of our current initiatives, we\u2019re building products in big markets, such as blockchain and NFTs for mobile content, marketing solutions for mobile OEMs and carriers, and enabling performance marketing in the fast-growing CTV market. These categories have similarities to the business and technologies we\u2019ve already built, and success in any one of these can meaningfully expand our business. We look forward to sharing our progress on these initiatives and others as they develop. With that, let me turn it over to Herald to provide color on our numbers and outlook. Hey, Stephen it\u2019s Adam. On your second question around Google\u2019s announced privacy changes, a couple of things there. One is, we don\u2019t know exactly the direction these changes will take, is the multiyear plan and Google works with all the major companies in the sector to ensure that there\u2019s not a disruption of performance on advertising, targeting and attribution. And then, pairs that with better privacy environment for the consumer. So it\u2019s just going to take a while to develop. That said, we obviously dealt with IDFA changes coming really quickly to the market in 2021. And you saw our business grow quite considerably on the Software side in \u201821. Going into the changes, we talked about the privacy change on Apple being muted for our business. You saw us growing 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q2, you saw the same trend in Q3 and Q4. So our business is growing quite quickly. And these changes actually in a way do benefit us, because the core of our data that drives our machine learning is all first-party data achieved and accessed from our own game. So, we believe we\u2019re set up very well to perform, regardless of any sort of privacy changes, the \u2013 regulatory changes of the ecosystem. Yeah. So when we look at anything that\u2019s new, we do that incremental to what our current opportunities are. But we do want them to be related to the expertise that we have, both in terms of technology platform, audience and data, so that we have a higher likelihood of success if we do invest in something. And so, the three areas I mentioned, the carrier and OEM space, marketing solutions to really enable manufacturers to generate more from their device sales than they currently generate from the solutions they have available, is something that\u2019s a natural extension of our machine learning demand in Software Platform. The NFT and blockchain marketplace and solutions there are just incremental ways to help monetize mobile gamers. And we\u2019ve got 200 million of them playing our games and then across our audience network, we accessed 2 billion of them every single month. And so because of our penetration of the mobile ecosystem, we think helping enable developers to expand their monetization opportunity with solutions there is beneficial to all parts of our business, so it makes sense to invest there. And then finally, the connected TV space, very similar to what we do today, we\u2019re serving full-screen immersive video advertisements on mobile devices and extending that and the performance models to TV is a new and fast-growing digital access point for content, feels like a natural extension for our \u2013 of our platform. All of these are covered in the guidance that we\u2019ve given you in terms of costs, if any of them hit and \u2013 and frankly, hitting on a new business is always hard. But these are so related to what we do, that if any of them hit it dramatically widens and expands our market opportunity and growth opportunities for years to come, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing there. Hey, Tim. On the first part of \u2013 do you want to \u2013 I\u2019ll handle the first part, Herald, do you want to jump in on the second? So, on the first part, our Software business is pretty much all organic, really adjust was the only material acquisition we\u2019d had before we announced closing MoPub in January. And in Q4, we saw a 27% quarter-over-quarter growth. Obviously, the numbers are getting bigger each quarter and yet the quarter-over-quarter growth is much higher than anything \u2013 anyone sees in the industry on the Software side, and is kept up. And what we\u2019re seeing even though AXON is maturing, and we lapped the prior years\u2019 numbers with AXON, is that, advertisers who are using our solution are investing more dollars every single quarter into the platform, because as data builds and they can validate that the performance results are very strong, they want more of \u2013 more of it. And that\u2019s why you saw a huge step up in dollars per SPEC in the quarter. And we expect to continue to see AXON improve over time, because these machine learning systems as they get more data and they get more scale benefit from that and become more and more accurate on behalf of the customers that are using it. Going forward, MoPub presents an opportunity for \u2013 for a continued expansion, more access to demand and then obviously a large expansion of access to audience on our marketing platform, MAX. And MoPub as of \u2013 as of last year, had a very strong year. And then coming into January, it was doing very well. But it is going to be completely rolled into our solution, we\u2019re going to take those demand partners, the DSPs and advertisers that were buying through MoPub to gain access to the MoPub audience. And we\u2019re integrating them into our MAX solution to give them direct access to the unified offering, which is now going to be over twice as big as MoPub was. So we think that\u2019s going to present an opportunity to create revenue growth from that access point for possibly years to come. And we\u2019re very optimistic about the \u2013 the acquisition, because we\u2019ve seen so little churn, as mentioned, 90% plus, of all top publishers are migrating over to our platform. Now, I\u2019ll hand it off to Herald for the second part. Hey, Jason it\u2019s Adam, and thanks for the question. So, three years ago when we got into gaming, we made it strategic and focused, and obviously gaming, super fragmented. But it became strategic to us, because we wanted to accumulate content across every single category of gaming, so that we can have that data to feed into the Software Platform and execute on \u2013 on obviously, what you\u2019re seeing for a lot of our numbers today. We\u2019ve checked the box on gaming. So we\u2019ve got enough of a gaming business and enough audience and data, that the Software business can do its thing. And obviously as you\u2019ve seen this year, the exceptional growth of the Software business proves that. And then in the last year, we announced two material Software acquisitions, which we think strengthened our current offering. And obviously, we\u2019re in the middle of integrating those. So that\u2019ll take us forward on an organic basis for quite some time on current initiatives. Then, when we look at new initiatives, what we really think about is, is there a possible acquisition to go do to accelerate our ability to extend our platform, our audience and our data to something new in those categories that I talked about in my script. And \u2013 and then separately, when we look at those new categories, we wonder like, shall we build and so that build versus buy decision is always going to be one that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s top of mind. But I would say what\u2019s strategic for us now is a lot different than what\u2019s been strategic for us the last few years as we went through a whole bunch of acquisitions to get that data intact to power the Software business to become what it has to the market-leading platform. I let Herald answer part two, maybe first, because I think it\u2019s quick. And then I\u2019ll answer part one. Yeah. On the first part really what you\u2019re asking about is like, how important is gaming and gaming growth to the Software growth. And what really what we knew going in as we built out this machine learning system is, these types of Software solutions are built on having really good data, and then being able to extend that data into predictive lookalikes across the whole audience. And we\u2019ve got 200 million monthly active users and 2 billion that we see across the platform. And that ratio is working really well for us today. Longer-term, and we\u2019ve said this repeatedly over the last year, we\u2019re not a games company, we\u2019re a software company really helping our partners grow. And as you look at our Software revenue, it\u2019s expanded dramatically. On the game side, the vast majority of our user acquisition span, which is the core driver of gaming growth is on our own platform. But as we continue to expand our relationships on the Software side, and really get more dollars from third-parties, we\u2019re going to take the third-party reported revenue number and converge it with that TSTV number, because we expect our Software platform to be able to grow much faster than our desire to spend on user acquisition on the games\u2019 portfolio, because we already have the data that we need to power the Software platform. So, you\u2019ll see our focus is going to be to continue to expand the dollars that third-parties are paying us on the Software side, whether it\u2019s through MAX, whether it\u2019s through the demand side relationships that we\u2019re going to inherit through MoPub or the vast majority of the revenue, the direct relationships with advertisers buying on a performance basis on our platform. You know we\u2019ve talked about this before, the nice thing about gaming data is that, it expands to other markets. And we\u2019re seeing non-gaming is a fast growth sector in our business. And we\u2019ve seen it over the last year. And if you think about the data, what data do we collect today, what is the first-party data? Well, if someone pays $50 in the last week in a game like Project Makeover, that tells you a lot about that person, but they\u2019re not only playing Project Makeover, and they\u2019re not only playing games, they\u2019re doing a lot more than that. They might be in the shopping apps, they might be in the fashion design app, they might be in the home design app, food delivery, et cetera. And our systems can figure that out with the datasets that we have. So, expansion across vertical to other app categories is something that we\u2019ve been excited about, we\u2019re seeing traction with and we continue to be excited about going forward. Yeah. So \u2013 so couple of things embedded in there. When we launched MAX, we did it because we wanted to facilitate real-time bidding to the marketplace quicker. And we \u2013 fundamentally we believe that the ad ecosystem should be traded in real-time, it\u2019s no different than a stock trading floor that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s gone programmatic over the last 20 years. And when it becomes real-time, it enables companies with a data advantage and a technology advantage to win their share of inventory, and make whatever margins they deserve to make, but it maximizes truly the dollars that the publisher earns. So today, MAX is the furthest ahead in the marketplace, delivering that real-time bidding to the publisher and to the end consumer to get that best ad out there on the device. It is a hybrid solution, it\u2019s bidding plus mediation, and we get paid when companies bid on MAX, they pay per seat on our marketplace, we don\u2019t with mediation. So over time, MAX\u2019s economics continue to improve. Now, we wanted to facilitate bidding, we are a bidder on MAX, we\u2019ve been a bidder in the marketplace for a couple of years, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re very good at it. Obviously, you\u2019ve seen the growth of our Software business expand dramatically. But we don\u2019t target a specific take rate from any of the ads we serve. If we can make a penny on the dollar, we\u2019re making an extra dollar \u2013 an extra penny of revenue. And we\u2019re reporting to on a net revenue basis. This is the one thing that\u2019s important to understand when we talk about \u2013 about our revenue this past quarter or even we\u2019re talking about $2 billion of Software revenue in \u201823. That\u2019s net revenue reported Software revenue. So it\u2019s exceptionally high margin, the cost to the publisher have already been taken out of the dollars that the advertiser passed. So really, any sort of constriction on take rate doesn\u2019t impact at all what we\u2019re going to report to you, because we\u2019re not operating, afraid of that today. And we\u2019re seeing continued growth in that Software business. And we\u2019re very confident about the continued growth of it going into \u201822 and \u201823. Yeah, so we \u2013 go ahead, Herald, do you want to \u2013 do you want to jump in? Yeah. So in the past, obviously a couple of years ago, when we launched MAX the market had no bidding, we\u2019ve gotten MAX to probably half bidding at this point. And we expect by the end of the year, the vast majority will be bid real-time. MoPub allows us to access MoPub demand, which is more of exchange-based demand. Real-time bidding is, it takes two forms. One is, from header bidding networks. These are companies such as ourselves, Facebook was one of the first adopters of bidding, so think the platforms with SDKs. And then there\u2019s another aspect to the market, which is Demand Side Platforms or DSPs. They plug into exchanges to use someone else\u2019s SDK to access the audience and bid in real-time as well. With MoPub, we\u2019re unifying the demand side bidders that are \u2013 are ad networks traditionally part of, as well as the DSPs into one unified marketplace, one unified real-time auction. And so bringing those DSPs live through our access point to this massive audience on MAX plus MoPub, is what we\u2019re excited about, that drove MoPub\u2019s revenue, the platform itself unified is over twice as big as MoPub ever was. And so that gives us a lot of access to growth in these demand side partnerships as they come online. I don\u2019t think we spoke about non-gaming apps, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re focused on building Software Platform technologies for these bigger markets. Connected TV is obviously one, we think performance marketing, and an extension of our current demand in data into the connected TV world can be very impactful. When it comes to blockchain and NFTs, both for gaming and non-gaming, if we can help facilitate the ability for users to engage with content, and really take ownership over that content through our Software Platform and our relationships, we think we can expand the monetization opportunity in mobile apps, which is very impactful for all of our partners than ourselves. And then lastly, we talked about taking our marketing solutions, machine learning and demand and enabling carriers and device manufacturers to generate more from the handsets that they sell to the consumer by doing partnerships with our platform. And so those are the three big areas that we\u2019re really focused on all software-centric. So I got you there. I think the answer is no for the reason I gave you before which is, we\u2019ve got so much first-party data now, when you know someone paid the $50 in Project Makeover, you know a lot of things about them. And one other things you know for certain, just \u2013 just conceptually we know as human beings, that person doesn\u2019t only play Project Makeover 24 hours a day, they do a lot of other things. If they\u2019ve got $200 a month to play \u2013 spend in a fashion design game, they\u2019re probably spending a lot of money on fashion ecommerce apps, food delivery apps, rideshare apps, a whole bunch of other things that had the household tend to invest in, and the machine learning can figure that out and enable non-gaming companies to market through our platform too and we\u2019ve talked about the category as \u2013 as being a fast-growing category, it\u2019s still not a big part of our business. So we don\u2019t talk about it broken out. But it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re excited about, because we\u2019ve already seen success in. The other part of that \u2013 that\u2019s important is a lot of the non-gaming spend that happens in mobile and then just on digital, in general, comes from demand side platforms. The big demand side platforms, omni-channel, where agencies will spend dollars through are not an area that we had any exposure to in our business prior to MoPub. As we integrate these MoPub partnerships into our unified offering, and give them access to over twice as much of the eyeballs, we expect to see a lot of dollars flow through our platform direct to the consumer from those types of advertisers as well, which would qualify as non-gaming. No, really like \u2013 look our business long-term may have some sort of nominal migration fees, we\u2019ve had them in a nominal way in the past, the big amount in the quarter is specifically for MoPub publishers switching off of a platform that just going to go offline. One of the big issues of the platform that goes offline which really doesn\u2019t happen, this is a decade old Software Platform, is that, in the mobile app ecosystem, you can either update an app or not update an app, and a lot of old devices are set not to update. And so a lot of these publishers tend to lose an annuity value of revenue on users that choose not to update, and then MoPub is going to go offline. So they\u2019re no longer going to be able to advertise to those customers. And you just cross off a stream of revenue. And so we\u2019re taking this fund to make that not a problem for these publishers, because ultimately we looked at the MoPub deal is access to publishers, and the demand side, it was a very cost effective deal for us. But we \u2013 we didn\u2019t want the publishers to lose in the middle of that transaction. So we\u2019re covering the cost of that loss annuity due to the quick shutdown of this platform. And that ends up being a very unique case related to this acquisition, which is something you just don\u2019t tend to see in technology where a huge platform goes offline. Yeah, that\u2019s 100% right. That\u2019s why we \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about for \u2013 for the last year like, the games business may grow, it may not grow, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s scaled enough where it\u2019s fueling the massive growth in the Software business. And so you sort of have today 10% actual data, we have perfect data on our own apps. And then 90% is predicted lookalikes. Being at a scale that we\u2019re at today with the technologies and data platform and machine learning and algorithms that we built, you\u2019re obviously seeing a Software Platform that\u2019s growing much, much faster than any other platform in our industry. And so you can tell that \u2013 that \u2013 the 10x ratio of lookalikes to actual data works. Now, if we can get data on 2 billion mobile devices, we would take it, actual data is always better than lookalikes, but we know that it\u2019s exceptionally hard to go scale a platform to get that much direct first-party data, there \u2013 there\u2019s maybe only one company in the history of the world that\u2019s gotten that much scale to consumers, right. But we\u2019ve proven that at 200 million, we\u2019re very, very good on the Software side. So we\u2019re excited with where we\u2019re at on the data side of this business. I will be honest, I\u2019m reading up on what the law is right now. Can you give us a little insight into specifically what you\u2019re talking about? And then I\u2019ll answer it? Got it. And this is, you\u2019re talking about like the \u2013 the actual operating systems, the App Store tax and any other rule changes they make that \u2013 that could be seen as benefiting themselves, is that what you\u2019re talking about? So \u2013 so the App Store \u2013 App Store fees obviously, they\u2019re not going up. And \u2013 I think a lot of people are hopeful that alternatives can be introduced or the actual tax on the app store goes down. Overall, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re in a good position because, one, our Apps business is paying a hefty amount in the 30% every single year. But more importantly, these types of added competition to the marketplace make the pricing that goes to the end developer stronger. And so if that happens, you sort of take \u2013 if $1 becomes $0.70 today and say, and tomorrow it becomes $0.85, that\u2019s 20% more LTV that advertisers can go spend on a platform like ours. So \u2013 that would just immediately mean in a competitive marketplace like ours that you see a step function up in terms of the dollars that companies are willing to spend to go acquire new users, because they have those kinds of economics that they get in their favor. When it comes to other rule changes, the platforms do provide an immense amount of value. So we operate within the \u2013 the rules of the platforms and we can\u2019t predict where they go. The competition is always good for these ecosystems. And I think when we look at this, we know that we\u2019re one of the leaders in the market on the Apps side. And we\u2019re undoubtedly the largest advertising platform Apps side of the Facebook\u2019s and the Google\u2019s on mobile today that exists independent. And so we\u2019re set up really well to benefit from some of this disintermediation that might happen added competition and better economics for the content creators. Yes, that\u2019s not something that we break out yet. But I\u2019ll say really the \u2013 the area that\u2019s a big opportunity is, both that direct app marketer on our platform getting access to more through just Salesforce bringing more non-gaming customers into our ecosystem as we\u2019ve touched on, but more importantly something we haven\u2019t talked on, that I referenced earlier is, you end up with these omni-channel DSPs, trade desk obviously being a famous one. But there\u2019s very big companies here that route, non-gaming demand, specifically agency and brand dollars into mobile applications. With the MAX plus MoPub unified platform, we\u2019ve got the biggest supply side platform that the mobile app ecosystems ever seen in one place, we\u2019re the \u2013 we\u2019re the direct access to the consumer. And these agencies and those omni-channel DSPs are really going through this \u2013 this shift in mindset to try to optimize supply costs. So they get direct to the consumer. Well, they\u2019re going to be able to do it through our platform at massive amounts of scale now as they go and integrate into the MAX marketplace directly through us. And we think that\u2019s going to facilitate a lot of dollars in non-gaming to move into our ecosystem, which will be to the benefit of our publishing partners, but also to the benefit of us as the trading floor. Yeah, I mean, look, when we look at a new business, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re actually, all of our core team has been here for since we started the business a decade ago. And so we\u2019re very entrepreneurial. And the best new business is always to start with a few people that put together an idea and if it sticks in a hit, it can \u2013 it can really expand. Now, that\u2019s a traditional startup, we have advantages with our scale data platform or algorithms and the demand access and data access that we have. And so we picked categories where our relationships and our technologies will give us an advantage to help start. We\u2019re an entrepreneurial so we\u2019re building a lot of the core technologies ourselves. So we will look to buy potentially, if it makes sense. We\u2019ll also look to staff from the Apps side and \u2013 and in particular, with a couple of these businesses, we brought people from the Apps side to come in and run these businesses for us to give us even more confidence in executing them over the coming years. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam and thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us. As Adam noted, we had a very solid Q4 and an outstanding 2021. In 2021, we not only had great financial results, our revenue grew more than 90% and adjusted EBITDA grew more than 100%, we\u2019re able to fully ramp our AXON Machine Learning platform, build critical mass in our first-party apps, complete strategic acquisitions in both tech and content, access to public equity markets and private debt markets, and importantly, build out our Global Team and Board. This positions our company well for future growth. Instead of reading our financial and operating metrics for Q4 and 2021, which are well laid out in our earnings release and shareholder letter, I do want to highlight our outlook for \u201822 and Software targets for 2023. First, we plan to grow our scaled software business at over 100% for 2022. We\u2019re projecting Software Platform revenue for 2022 at just over $1.4 billion at the midpoint of our range, representing 111% year-over-year growth. This is a sizable upward revision from $1 billion dollar target we gave you earlier in 2021. Our outlook for continued robust growth stems from one, our strong finish to 2021 and record Q4 \u201821 results, setting us up well for organic growth in 2022. And two, as Adam mentioned already, our outlook benefits from the solid progress integrating MoPub into MAX. Well going forward, we won\u2019t be reporting on MoPub\u2019s standalone, since it is being fully integrated into the MAX platform. We continue to believe the MoPub acquisition should be a highly accretive and strategically impactful investment for our company in the near-term and over the long-term, as evidenced by our software guidance for \u201822 and \u201823 which I\u2019ll come to in a second. I do want to call out that we expect to pay approximately $200 million in migration fees to publishers coming on to the MAX platform, mostly in the first quarter. Given these costs related to the MoPub transaction, we plan to add back a substantial part \u2013 portion of that amount to our adjusted EBITDA. Post the MoPub acquisition, we would not be adding back those fees in the ordinary course. With regard to our \u201823 outlook for Software, given all the progress we made to-date and the many opportunities we see ahead, we\u2019re working hard to reach the $2 billion of Software revenue in 2023 as Adam mentioned. On the Apps side, our outlook is for $2.2 billion in 2022 at the midpoint of our range. It is amazing to say we had \u2013 negligible Apps revenue just four years ago and now have a multibillion dollar business with \u2013 an awesome set of studios and developers around the globe. While we reached critical mass to drive first-party data. The first-party data we need for our Machine Learning engine, we are continuing to make substantial investments in new content, and are planning to release new first-party apps with evergreen potential over the next several quarters. The midpoint of our outlook at $2.2 billion assumes modest revenue from new content. Given the inherent difficulty in projecting new content performance. To project our new apps and having more meaningful impact in the second half of \u201822. Note, that if we do have a new hit title, we would ramp our user acquisition to drive revenue as we did with Project Makeover over the last year. As it relates to our EBITDA for \u201822, we\u2019re targeting an adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 20s percent range up from 21% at 26%. Well, Adam and I are focused on compounding free cash flow over the long-term, we are and will invest for the long-term value creation rather than near-term profitability. Lastly and importantly, Adam, Ryan and I would like to thank you for your support in 2021 and please know that we and our AppLovin team are working hard to deliver for all of you in \u201822 and beyond. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Hey, Stephen, thanks for the question. You know historically as we said in the mediation space, there\u2019s been little volatility and people wants to run a platform stay there, because it is inherently integrated to all the applications were very, very sticky. And historically, we\u2019ve not paid these fees in the past. For the acquisition of MoPub and MoPub being shut down as a service at the end of \u2013 end of this quarter, a lot of publishers needed to move quickly. And there\u2019s quite a bit of cost to them, actually from a revenue standpoint where they potentially can lose revenue, given the speed with which they need to migrate. And there\u2019s just cost to \u2013 to get the migration done. And so we negotiate these one-time fees to cover those costs. Thanks for the question, David, it\u2019s Herald. So, yeah overall we think the acquisition of MoPub you know with billion dollars we paid in this incremental, couple of million dollars to get publishers migrated is a highly accretive as mentioned strategic deal for us, and we do feel very good about that. And we do think the flow through on the Software side margin structure is high, there is as you note, more infrastructure to be built and as we\u2019re scaling and doubling the size of our Software business, you know we\u2019re having to keep up with that for sure. And we\u2019re bringing on you know a lot of new DSPs and a lot of new publishers simultaneously. I think for our guide for the year, maybe just taking a bigger picture look at it. In the high 20s EBITDA margin. As mentioned, we want to be investing for growth in the business and we think our ability to continue to grow the business over the long-term at scale you know requires that investments. So we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re trying to include what we think are some new projects in that EBITDA number, we are investing quite a bit into our studios as well. I think you \u2013 you know that we acquired a number of studios at the end of last year, we\u2019re scaling the investment into those studios to ensure that they\u2019ve got the right resources to deliver content on the back end. So we can certainly drive the business in a different direction in terms of overall margin, given their flow through but you know, we \u2013 there\u2019s so many opportunities for us to invest both on Software and Apps, where we\u2019d like to invest in both of them. Yeah, Tim, I think a lot of the foundational growth drivers Adam mentioned there you know for \u201822 look, we have a great organic business and you know quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4, right that was 28% increase, which is all organic, right. That\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s a pretty big move. Rolling into \u201822 then, we have you know the AppDiscovery continue to improve with underlying AXON, we also have Adjust you know doing well and good SaaS business growing at the rate you know rates that we\u2019d hoped. As mentioned, it\u2019s difficult then to parse out you know the impact of MoPub and MAX and exactly how that lays out. I know previously, we gave a number that the run rate of \u2013 of MoPub you know would be in the mid to 100s by the end of the year. We still remain you know very confident in that and frankly probably there\u2019s upside to that. One important note was, we did give guidance on that, that revenue the way we did, because it takes time to ramp, as mentioned before, migrate from one mediation platform to another, one, to get the publishers to migrate, and then to get the demand side to migrate. And so we\u2019re going through that process now as you know, but the impact of that in terms of the actual revenue booked in the year, therefore, you know it will be less than the [$250 million] [ph], it\u2019s more of a $250 million run rate was the target. When we announced the deal now that we\u2019re well into it, you know we feel very good about that number as well. So that led us to you know what is, I guess not a small range in terms of Software target at the high end of 15 \u2013 at $1.5 billion midpoint just over $1.4 billion. And then, where you can really see the impact overall you know is the guide to our target of you know trying to hit the $2 billion number in \u201823 just goes to the fact that we\u2019ve got you know a lot of confidence in putting these things together. And then the ecosystem building around that you know should allow us to drive pretty significant growth for this year and next. Yeah, just when we acquired it was around $100 million and \u2013 and it\u2019s growing at a solid double-digit rate. We\u2019ll continue to do that. You know we think for \u201822 and \u201823 as well. We\u2019ve assumed we\u2019re going to add back a substantial part of that $200 million to adjusted EBITDA, and therefore that is excluded in \u2013 in the guidance at the high 20s margin. Sure. I was going to say like, we don\u2019t operate the games as Business Apps or Consumer Apps. They\u2019re just games and apps, and they monetize with IP plus ads. So a lot of these \u2013 these products are hybrid. They\u2019re making money from advertisement to users, and then some users will pay within the games for content as well. Fundamentally though like, again, we\u2019ve said this a lot of times, we\u2019re not a games company. The games serve a purpose for us in our business. We\u2019ve gotten them to scale $2 billion plus business, which was great. More importantly, we\u2019re getting data first-party on 200 million monthly active users. And the games and growth in the games are driven strictly by what we\u2019re spending on user acquisition. That\u2019s what drives mobile gaming businesses outside of \u2013 of acquisitions and M&A, which we haven\u2019t done recently in the games business, and are less inclined to do so now that we have the data that we needed. So as you think about what matters to us in our business, we\u2019re talking about Software, software growth, we\u2019re one of the fastest-growing Software businesses on the face of the planet today, scaling this business to a couple of billion dollars next year. And that\u2019s important, because today we report to you that TSTV number, which is a lot bigger than the Software reported revenue we give you. That delta is a spend for own games on our own platform. Well as our Software business goes from where it is, and \u2013 and we talked coming into this year, $1 billion dollar is projected for this year, we just raised that up 40%, and are now talking about $2 billion next year. As that continues to grow, that\u2019s all going to be dollars from third-parties, we\u2019re not going to be able to double the amount that we\u2019re spending on our current games, because they just don\u2019t justify that kind of expansion. And so you\u2019ll see the third-party number converge with that TSTV number. And that gives us a lot of room to grow, the dollars we\u2019re collecting and the margins that we\u2019re able to make from the business while focusing on what we care about, which is Software, not necessarily the games part of our business. Yeah, thanks, Matt for the questions. Yeah, again the Software business as you \u2013 as you know, has grown you know tremendously over the course of the year, and we\u2019re projecting it to continue to do that. And you know, we gave the SPEC number to try to give a little more granularity into the bill you know price volume wise. What aspect, and of course, it\u2019s grown considerably you know price volume more in the fourth quarter in terms of people scaling quite rapidly, in particular, ex Adjust to $757,000 in the quarter. So a pretty significant amount of money of increase. What \u2013 what was slower in that period was the actual SPEC count. And that\u2019s really due to the fact that in the third quarter, we \u2013 we added a lot of SPECs that we\u2019re testing and whatnot, and didn\u2019t add as many of those in the fourth quarter. So we still \u2013 feel very good about the \u2013 the customer growth, obviously with all the migrating customers from MoPub. Again, it\u2019ll be hard to distinguish you know who\u2019s a MAX customer who\u2019s a MoPub customer, because it\u2019s all going to be MAX customers, we were highly confident in the Software line growing and therefore you know price quantity has to follow that. One footnote to that, and it isn\u2019t in our letter, but didn\u2019t want to highlight it, just wanted to keep things clear for this. In our letter on the upfront side, we kept the SPEC numbers the same. One very detailed point is our SPEC definition was based on a run rate per quarter, they had to get to $125,000, of run rate in the quarter. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to report that metric for a little bit. But we\u2019re really going to go focus more on an LTM basis to have $125,000 of revenue. The reason I point that out is, that\u2019ll get rid of some of the volatility that is inherent if you use just a quarterly run rate number of SPECs coming and going, and given the scale of the customers we\u2019re talking about. We think that\u2019ll be a much \u2013 much better metric going forward."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Gee, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance for AppLovin. Thank you. Mr. Gee, you may begin.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Jason and welcome everyone to AppLovin\u2019s earnings call for the quarter ended September 30th, 2021. Joining me today to discuss our results are Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi; and our President and Chief Financial Officer, Herald Chen. Please note that our SEC filings, earnings release, and Shareholder Letter discussing our 3Q performance are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. These statements are based on assumptions and beliefs and we assume no obligation to update them. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. Please review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q as well as elsewhere in our SEC filings for further clarification. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures.

Please be sure to review these reconciliations as non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. Reminder this conference call is being recorded and replay will be available on our IR website shortly. With that, I will now turn it over to our CEO, Adam Foroughi.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks Ryan. Our headline results and our Shareholder Letter outline our strong Q3 performance. So, I'm going to keep my comments brief to allow more time for Q&A. I want to emphasize three things that really speak to the platform we are building and how our differentiated model is driving our success. First, consider how fast we are growing. Our software platform revenue just grew 385% year-over-year to $193 million. Our growth has been accelerating for four quarters in a row now, largely organic. We quadruple their new specs and our net dollar base retention was 255%. Second, consider the massive opportunity still ahead of us. As the market absorbed IDFA changes, most advertising platforms saw modest sequential gains, yet our software business grew 32% quarter-over-quarter. We were growing fast before platform changes and continue to do so after, which is a testament to the strength of our team and our technologies. Our customers are performance-driven, that means our growth and our scale is a direct reflection of the strong performance of our integrated platform. Our exceptional growth rate is continued proof of the advantages created by our business model and machine learning platform, AXON. You may not realize it, but AXON is only a year old and we've seen rapid acceleration in customer performance and adoption. That's why we're so excited about our future. We think we have a path to grow our software business for 30% plus year-over-year for many years to come. Now, there's clearly a lot of execution ahead, but just imagine what it would take for us to grow like that for the next decade. It would only take adding 20% more specs a year and growing a dollar per spec 10% per year. Today, we have 280 specs on AppDiscovery and MAX accounting for $587,000 per quarter each of GAAP reported software revenue. The count of specs just grew 18% versus Q2, and our dollar per spec just grew 13% versus Q2. Adjust brought on our salesforce for the first time. We have just begun selling our platform, AXON. Our performance is exceptional for our existing clients and we have a huge opportunity to attract new ones. It isn't hard to imagine us being a $10 billion software business in 10 years. And remember all the incremental dollars are almost all margin. Lastly, consider the potential combination of MAX and MoPub. MAX is already one of the largest and fastest growing ad exchanges powering around $5 billion in media spend. A year ago, 10,000 apps were using MAX as a software platform to manage their ad monetization. As of the end of Q3, that number is almost 30,000 and growing rapidly. We believe our unified platform should surpass $15 billion in advertiser spend across all industry bidders entering 2023. This would make our exchange one of the largest advertising ecosystems in the world. With that, I'll hand it off to Herald to walk you through our financial details.\nHerald Chen: Thanks Adam and thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us today. As you can hear from Adam, we're extremely pleased with the performance of the business in the quarter, continuing on the strong momentum we saw in the first half of the year and we feel like we're very well-positioned for growth in the fourth quarter next year and beyond. In Q3, year-over-year, we did grow total revenue 90% and EBITDA more than doubled year-over-year. We were able to drive 26% EBITDA margins and have another rule of -- number that's well under three digits. As Adam noted, our software performance was exceptional and I wanted to highlight a few more details that you'll find in our Shareholder Letter. Even when excluding adjusted, software platform revenue quadrupled versus last year and increased organically by 316%. It's due to the efficacy of our software solutions that's clear to the market, adding both the number of specs that we added as well as increasing the take rate we're getting from each one of those specs. Software now represents 27% of our overall revenue and as our software grows, that drives margins and cash flow that can be reinvested in our business. On the app side, the portfolio grew 56% year-over-year, a very solid performance and our maps increased quarter-over-quarter as well. While this is strong performance from an application standpoint, this really helps to generate more scale first party data, which is a key component or AXON Machine Learning Engine, which as you know, powers our software platform. Note, this extra cash flow that we've been generating from software allows us to reinvest in our business across the board, including studio development capacity and investments in Q3, where we invest in behind a robust slate of future titles. As Adam mentioned, we continue to see positive tailwinds in our business and are excited about our expanding market and strategic and financial position soon entering 2022. As we talked about in the second quarter, our outlook for software is to reach over $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2022. That's over a 60% year-over-year growth over our $600 million target also offered in the second quarter. Now, on top of that, with a pending acquisition of MoPub, that would add an incremental $240 million to $260 million of revenue run rate exiting 2022 and would have very minimal costs at about $40 million. As discussed, we're waiting for regulatory approval to determine the timing of the close of that transaction. Before we take your questions, Adam and I are pleased to also announce that Alyssa Harvey Dawson has joined our Board of Directors. Alyssa is currently the Chief Legal Officer at Gusto, a modern HR software platform. Her deep experience in past roles across tech and consumer verticals will be highly accretive to our Board. We're also pleased to announce that our Board member Cathy Sun joined AppLovin full time this past summer to help lead new initiatives. Given her new role in the Board, she'll be stepping down from the Board -- she has stepped down from our Board this past meeting. With that, I'll turn it over to Ryan to help organize some questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much and congrats, guys. Two quick questions. First, maybe on the software platform revenues, explosive growth, how should we think about growth in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022, particularly as your anniversaried launch of AXON in September, I guess you've already I guess anniversaried at the $193 million run rate, the $1 billion target that you have for next year looks pretty reasonable. Just wondering if there is -- if you see potential upside to that ex-Admob, of course. And then it looks like half or maybe 40 of the specs net ads came from Adjust, which maybe speaks to the attraction in upselling those clients to your solution, the other half were I think net new, which is kind of in line with what you guys did in the prior quarter, I think in Q2, is that the right interpretation and the right cadence we should think of as maybe we look forward or we'll look at the growth in that segment? Thank you.\nHerald Chen: Thanks Youssef. Maybe I'll start and Adam you can add on and take in reverse order. Just in terms of the number of specs that we do break it out for you in the Shareholder Letter, we articulate that excluding Adjust, we have 280 specs on our AppLovin software, excluding Adjust and in the second quarter, we had 237. So that run rate, you're right is about additional 40 excluding Adjust. Now, Adjust obviously give us access to their salesforce, they're cross-selling our solutions, and ended on themselves by the way that the Adjust product for attribution is growing and adding spec count as well, that gets us to the total of 449. So, we're excited by that progress. We're excited by that salesforce. Ultimately, if we're able to close MoPub, that obviously goes a lot more bandwidth in terms of team as well as technology to sell as well. So, I think that's a good run rate for us to continue to execute against that 40-plus specs for AppLovin alone. It will start to get more confusing those as we do cross-sell, it'll be harder to determine. Was it really just an MoPub customer, as you know, we have over 8,000 customers on our platform, but only the 449, they're at the spec level today. So, there's a lot of existing customers that may not be viewed as new, but will become spec over time. And with your question regarding the software, we gave the guidance in the second quarter on software for the first time, we don't intend to update that guidance today. But as Adam said, we're extremely excited by the quarter-over-quarter growth rate, where we had the 18% increase and 13% increase in price quantity respectively. And we think that momentum will continue as Adjust salesforce continues to ramp our technology, our machine learning engine continues to improve and with scale machine learning engines also improve. So as we add on to the platform, there is a virtuous cycle to that improvement. And then hopefully with MoPub in 2022, sometime, we will be able to accelerate it from there. I think our plan would be to update guidance in general, including talking about our software number when we report the fourth quarter numbers early next year.\nYoussef Squali: Got it. Thanks Herald.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So, Adam, big picture. I think at last quarter's Shareholder Letter, you disclosed that you helped your clients install about 2 billion apps in the first half of the year. So, if we are on track to make that 4 billion installs for all of this year, on audience that you have around like 2 billion people, that's like two installs per user per year, which seems like a lot of whitespace for you to run into. So, you talked a lot about that the dollar growth that you can drive, but talk about the pieces that are coming together for you to make a more efficient use of your ad impressions that you're showing now. So, we can think about taking the installs from maybe 4 billion this year to maybe 15 billion, 16 billion, 20 billion over some timeframe? Or if your growth is not going to be as volume-driven, like what can help you drive higher effective pricing over time? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks Steven. And really this ties back to some of the stuff I was saying in the lead in, but we're really excited about the many year outlook on the software business, because AXON is just a year old and it's really easy to forget that in our business. And machine learning platforms get much more precise over time as they accumulate more data and more opportunity. When we started the platform a year ago, we only had in the hundreds of specs. Now, we have 280. Imagine a machine learning software that had one, it couldn't personalize or matchmake very accurately in terms of what it was going to show a customer. Well, we have 280 customers that are spending a substantial amount with us and getting exceptional performance. So, what we're most excited about is bringing more customers online, will give the platform the capacity to become more personalized in the offering, and then that'll drive up pricing because it'll also drive up competition. We think that can lead to an immense amount of growth over the next decade.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nollen: Thanks very much. Just like to ask a question on MoPub please. If you could talk a bit more about the scale benefits that it really brings you. It seems like kind of an obvious thing to say that scale is important, especially on the aviation [ph] side, but just maybe a bit more color on how that really helps you? And then it's its growth rate seems to have been fairly slow coming into your acquisition, I wonder how much it can help -- how much you can help accelerate it or it can help accelerate your growth? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks Tim. MoPub itself as a platform has been in the market for about a decade. They built out a lot of tools. They catered a much broader set of demand. Tools that that are successful tools for agencies and brands to bring demand into the mobile marketplace, as well as a robust set of DSPs. Pretty much every DSP in mobile was working with our marketplace. When we launched MAX three years ago, we took a different approach and built a lightweight platform that was really automated and pure for the mobile game developer. And MAX has we've noticed has grown immensely. It's processing around $5 billion of advertising spent a year right now on the platform. What we didn't do was layer on this incremental functionality that would bring even more demand into the ecosystem. By bringing MoPub supply in, we'll expand the supply to get to a point of late next year, what we think is a target of over $15 billion of ad spend, which makes it one of the largest platforms in the world. When you have a platform that big, it attracts demand and we'll be combining in the unified solution the MoPub products that to go attract that demand over and we think once that happens, the whole platform will accelerate and grow.\nTim Nollen: Thanks. And does it expand you much beyond the gaming vertical into other sectors as well?\nAdam Foroughi: 100%. MoPub works with both games and non-games. And a lot of these technologies and products that they built for a broader set of demand appealed to non-gaming just as much as gaming. So, we're going to go after the entire mobile app ecosystem with this this integration and unified solution.\nTim Nollen: Great. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Adam, I wonder if you could just provide an update on how the IDFA changes impacted your software and content businesses through the quarter? And then maybe I'll do a follow-up on MoPub, I'm wondering if you could just talk to the integration of it, how you'll onboard their apps onto MAX and maybe speak to any risk of client attrition during that time? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, I'll go reverse order just so I can remember. MAX, in marketplace discussions and talking about a unified MAX MoPub platform, the reception has been exceptionally positive, both in terms of advertisers and publishers. MoPub itself, as part of Twitter, wasn't a focused product. It's been a long-term product that had a lot of retained customers for many years. But there hadn't been a lot of innovation and product investment the way we do when we're focused on a product that's core to our business. And so as we've spoken to the publishers, there's a lot of excitement about the possibility of bringing the two platforms together, and tapping into this immense scale and incremental demand, which we think will create more competition, more publisher yield, and more growth in the ecosystem for all parties that intersect with it. On the first question, the IDFA impact in the marketplace, as you saw in our numbers and a lot of advertising platforms, advertising quarter-over-quarter was mostly muted in terms of growth. So, there is loss in terms of targeting that's possible with IDFA going away, and publisher CPMs did diminish on iOS, that was offset on the publishing side with gains on Android as demand shifted over there. Now, our platform, we have an advantage in the marketplace because of our scaled first-party data that fuels our AXON machine learning system. And as prices came down and competition lessoned, our platform stood stronger than others. And that's what allowed us to grow faster than others. That paired with the fact that we were already on a really fast growth trajectory because of AXON quarter-over-quarter for the last few quarters and that continues to accelerate led to the strong quarter.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Clark Lampen from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nClark Lampen: Hi, guys. Good evening. I wanted to ask a follow-up on IDFA relative to the last question. When we did some checks into the quarter, one of the biggest sort of points of friction that we sort of came up with as you and peers were seemingly gaming share, was the idea that developers were somewhat limited in terms of budget deployment because of scale and reach. The MoPub deal seems to go a long way in sort of reducing that kind of friction. So, I'm curious if we should expect maybe share gains to increase or compound or maybe spending to increase or compound from here? And then separately on the consumer business, I wanted to see getting you guys just launched Bermuda Adventures at Belka, I wanted to see if he could give us an update on maybe what the pipeline looks like over the balance of this year and into next? And also whether there are specific games or studios where you're expecting to deliver new content that might help you recapture or grow the active player base? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: So, on the first question, obviously, to grow a business as quickly as we are, it could be the possibility of technological enhancement, more customers or share gains. We think we've gotten -- we've executed across all three of those factors. And you almost have to to be able to grow as much as we did quarter-over-quarter. Companies that depend on identity, lose more when the ID goes away, especially when that identity is built on third-party data. Our identity and our datasets and models are built on our first-party data. And so we ended up in a very advantaged position. We're also starting from a very low point of penetration with customers. When you talk about a business that's getting as big as ours as quickly as it is, and only having 280 software platform enterprise clients, it leaves a lot of room for growth. So, we were already executing on all vectors coming in. IDFA changes help decrease competition in the market. Our business model has advantages that are going to be hard for others to overcome. And we continue to accelerate through it. Now, the market is just green field for us and there's going to be more customers that are going to come on our platform is as a unified MAX and MoPub supply, there are very few add opportunities in the world at the scale of $15 billion a year of ad spend flowing through one single access point and our exchange will be that and so we're really excited about the future prospects of this business. In terms of games and evergreen titles, we touched on this last quarter, we do invest heavily in games -- in game development and in particular, organic releases of games, there's going to be a focus going forward. In order to continue to facilitate growth in our software business, data is key and first-party data, as we've touched on is really important. So, we do want to keep our content fresh. Over the quarter, we launched three titles, that took half the investment. And what we call an evergreen title is one that we think will get to $100 million plus a year revenue run rate and cost multiple millions of dollars to develop. We launched three of those in the quarter; Ace Defender, Bermuda Farm, Jackpot Master Slot. All three we believe over the next year, we'll go and achieve the $100 million a year run right and will be titles that will engage players for years to come. As we continue to invest in our workforce, now 3,000 roughly creators around the world, we're really going to invest behind developing our own content, organically releasing them in a high amount of frequency, and continuing to fuel growth on the app side and more fresh data coming in, that we can then go monetize on our highly successful software platform.\nClark Lampen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Pang from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDavid Pang: Great. Thanks for the question, guys. Can you talk about the composition of new enterprise clients? Did you see an uptick of non-gaming clients in the quarter?\nAdam Foroughi: The new enterprise clients in large part still are a lot of clients that are just spending more on our platform and tipping the threshold. If you've got 250% roughly net dollar retention, a lot of those customers as Herald touched on 8,000 in the system, will continue to cross over into the threshold and grow because the solution is just working so well for even the smaller clients in our system. The Adjust cross-sell opportunity -- and really instead of calling it that, I'd like to think of it as our salesforce is bringing new customers on board as well. And we didn't touch on this, but just one data point that that's exciting for us is that non-gaming customers quarter-over-quarter, Q3 versus Q2 grew almost 100%. It was our fastest growing vertical. Now, we don't break that out formally yet. It's still too small in the overall grand scheme of all of our numbers. But it is a huge growth opportunity. And as we bring that MoPub supply online and integrate it with our MAX supply and create that amount of scale both across gaming and non-gaming publishers, we think that non-gaming category is going to be very compelling. We've also recently put out a couple of case studies that highlight new non-gaming customers coming on our platform and seeing a lot of success. So, going forward, we expect that to continue to be a growing part of our new specs coming online.\nDavid Pang: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ralph Schackart from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nNick Leibold: Good evening. This is Nick Leibold on for Ralph Schackart. I wanted to ask on the MAX mediation platform. More recently Unity announced its in-app bidding offering and IronSource announced its acquisition of a TapJoy and obviously your MoPub acquisitions been talked about. So, I was hoping you could maybe share your view on the competitive landscape within your mobile ad tech with this recent consolidation. Do you view the growth and consolidation of other mediation platforms as a threat? Or is it a net benefit to the ecosystem and how much crossover is there on clients that are using both yours and IronSource and Unity's unities offering?\nAdam Foroughi: So, clients tend to only use one because these platforms are pretty robust and fairly complicated to integrate. But we're a fan of there being more options for publishers. The more options there are in the marketplace, the more innovation there is, both in terms of demand partners, and in terms of publishing partners. What we're focused on is delivering the best solution for publishers. And we put out a blog actually on AppLovin blog yesterday that we link to off the Shareholder Letter that shows you how fast MAX has been growing. We launched it three years ago. In three years, it's grown to be one of the largest platforms in the marketplace, and almost 30,000 apps have integrated this platform. And as I touched on, they don't usually use another one at the same time. So, you can think of it as almost exclusive integration. The MoPub clients coming over will take that scale and create a lot more, roughly double, and both in terms of apps, audience, and dollar spent through the platform. And so we're really excited about the possibility of unifying the platforms, the products that we're going to be able to enable, and the gains that publishers and advertisers will see from all of that. And so we're very focused on executing our vision going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMatt Cost: Hi, guys, it's Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Looks like there was about $180 million worth of acquisition in the quarter on the cash flow statement. I'm just wondering was there anything -- what was the composition of those acquisitions? And was there any contribution to 3Q revenue from any businesses you brought in? And then just secondly, just looking at the composition of growth, it looks like spend for second spec were both up in 3Q. Adam, you referred to kind of like a future formula for growth, as you know, growing at a 10% rate. I know that wasn't guidance, but just how do you think about the drivers of growth on a per spec basis? What are people spending more on? They just use -- putting more wallet share into your product, are they using multiple products? How does that go up over time? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, let me answer the second one, the business question, and then Herald will touch on the usage of new capital in the quarter. The driving factors for dollars growing on specs in the platform or really it's very simple. It's just efficiency. Customers are buying on our platform on a performance basis. They're either buying, targeting a specific return on ad spend or they're buying targeting a cost per subscriber, a cost per first food order, cost per purchaser, but it is some function of a goal that they have, so they go and target. As customers spend more, they put more data into our system and our system gets more efficient. As it gets more efficient, they want to put more dollars into the system. So, it just creates a very sticky product that gets them to have a desire to continue to invest more dollars into the platform and that's what you saw this quarter, with just quarter-over-quarter, the same clients growing 13% in the dollars that they spent. Now, again, we only have 280 specs in the system. As we get more competition in the platform, if customers are getting the results that they want and competition goes up, inevitably, they're going to have to price more aggressively to continue to spend at a more accelerated clip. And those two factors combined create a function that creates growth on both numbers. And so that's what we're very excited about. That's been a formula that's fueled ad ecosystems that have become very big over time. Consistently, as you add competition, you create growth and so that's the inflection point that we're at. We've got the salesforce, we're bringing the MoPub team as well, super sophisticated team. They'll be able to sell to agencies and DSPs and a lot of app developers. Our own team will be selling app developers. And so we think as more clients come in, everything's going to go up into the right from here for many years to come. And Herald can touch on the use of the cash.\nHerald Chen: Yes. Thanks Adam and thanks matt for the question. Look overall, is everyone else in the M&A side, we continue to be on the lookout for the right strategic acquisitions to drive long-term growth. We know we're looking for, we know what assets are worth and so allows us to move quickly with speed and certainty on what want to own and then not waste time on things that don't fit our criteria. Because in the gaming, we've got a fairly comprehensive portfolio now and with a strong first-party data, however, we certainly want to augment that as we can. And in the quarter, we did find of that number, there was one asset that was about $150 million of an asset app purchase, that was included another casual game app that fits well in our portfolio. That was the majority of the spend in the quarter. But we'll continue to be on the hunt for those assets. We're not super-focused on adding apps, particularly given the elevated pricing in the market, but we'll certainly be looking -- and then on the software side, as you can tell, particularly with the MoPub deal, we're looking for the right strategic opportunities there as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Martin Yang from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.\nMartin Yang: Good afternoon, Adam and Herald. A follow-up question on the previous analysts. Can you maybe talk about how your scaled first-party data that are collected on the platform can inform on your app development and the type of studios you choose to partner with?\nAdam Foroughi: So, our scaled first-party data is much more important to fuel the growth of our software side. It helps inform the models on what the users are interested in, and what other users that are similar to them are interested in. And that's really what's fueling the success on the software side. So, that first-party data doesn't inform what we do on the app development side. Actually, for years, our goal on app development was to go partner with studios across every genre of mobile gaming that we believed we can grow. And many of these studios were early in their growth cycle and -- so we went out, partnered with them, helped facilitate growth, that scaled data across an interest category to us. That data then feeds into our software engine and that's fueled a lot of the growth. We now are at a point where with numerous studios, almost 20 around the world, and 3,000 creators, we've got expertise across every major mobile gaming category. So, we're very excited about where we're at. And now we're investing into taking the current games and continuing to expand them and creating new games and organically releasing them into the market. And so long as we execute on that, we'll continue to have scaled data feeding into our engine that we're monetizing exceptionally well.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thanks. The second question is whether or not there's any synergy between MoPub and Adjust, that will help you to approach non-gaming customers? Or are they just separate touchpoints to work with the non-gaming customers.\nAdam Foroughi: It gives us access to more potential clients, both for Adjust an AppDiscovery and obviously, the unified mediation platform. The MoPub team is also very seasoned. So, they'll integrate with our team, salesforce will integrate the will create a unified offering, both in terms of publisher sales and advertiser sales. And we think just reach an access of market leading solutions across attribution, growth, and discovery and monetization will let us go get in front of every single major company in the space, which should facilitate more sales.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Clark Lampen from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nClark Lampen: Thanks for taking the follow-up. I've got a hunch that you guys are going to punch this question into the stratosphere. But you dropped a bit of a breadcrumb with Kathy [indiscernible] coming on board to Florida to help you explore some new initiatives for the business? And just curious if you might be willing to give us a general sense for what he's spending our time on now? Or maybe ask differently. Can you remind us what you guys think are the most attractive adjacent opportunities for the business today?\nAdam Foroughi: Well, we'll get there soon, Clark, but right now, what you should think about is what are the assets that we have in place and what else can we do with that? Because that's what guides our thought around new initiatives. And we launched AXON machine learning engine a year ago, and you've seen really dramatic growth on software. We went from 200 years ago to talk about 600 plus this year to over a billion next year, and accelerating and that's offer is working really well in a highly competitive ad ecosystem. What else can that type of machine learning be applied to is something we will always ask ourselves and that can guide us. Another way we think about it is we go out and monetize mobile app inventory right now, predominantly using full screen video ads. What are were other places where the consumers that we have data on at in this first-party data, that we can go find those consumers and serve them video ads, using our software engine to create scale and grow. So, that's another way to think about it and what we think about. And then the third and most important maybe, is our audience is around 200 million monthly actives playing our mobile games. We've got 3,000 game developers, building content for our platform. The audience of our own network isn't the $2 billion -- 2 billion users a month. So, it's a massively scaled audience of mobile game players and then mobile game developers both building games for us and third-party clients of ours. If we can use that reach that audience those games, to then go after some of the newer opportunities in terms of usage and gameplay and ownership to the consumer and things like Metaverse and blockchain that could also be interesting. And so we think about all of these things. We think we've got very exciting assets in place to really go after these opportunities and over the next couple of years, we hope you'll see us execute on many of the above.\nClark Lampen: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: There are no more questions in the queue. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thanks Ryan. Our headline results and our Shareholder Letter outline our strong Q3 performance. So, I'm going to keep my comments brief to allow more time for Q&A. I want to emphasize three things that really speak to the platform we are building and how our differentiated model is driving our success. First, consider how fast we are growing. Our software platform revenue just grew 385% year-over-year to $193 million. Our growth has been accelerating for four quarters in a row now, largely organic. We quadruple their new specs and our net dollar base retention was 255%. Second, consider the massive opportunity still ahead of us. As the market absorbed IDFA changes, most advertising platforms saw modest sequential gains, yet our software business grew 32% quarter-over-quarter. We were growing fast before platform changes and continue to do so after, which is a testament to the strength of our team and our technologies. Our customers are performance-driven, that means our growth and our scale is a direct reflection of the strong performance of our integrated platform. Our exceptional growth rate is continued proof of the advantages created by our business model and machine learning platform, AXON. You may not realize it, but AXON is only a year old and we've seen rapid acceleration in customer performance and adoption. That's why we're so excited about our future. We think we have a path to grow our software business for 30% plus year-over-year for many years to come. Now, there's clearly a lot of execution ahead, but just imagine what it would take for us to grow like that for the next decade. It would only take adding 20% more specs a year and growing a dollar per spec 10% per year. Today, we have 280 specs on AppDiscovery and MAX accounting for $587,000 per quarter each of GAAP reported software revenue. The count of specs just grew 18% versus Q2, and our dollar per spec just grew 13% versus Q2. Adjust brought on our salesforce for the first time. We have just begun selling our platform, AXON. Our performance is exceptional for our existing clients and we have a huge opportunity to attract new ones. It isn't hard to imagine us being a $10 billion software business in 10 years. And remember all the incremental dollars are almost all margin. Lastly, consider the potential combination of MAX and MoPub. MAX is already one of the largest and fastest growing ad exchanges powering around $5 billion in media spend. A year ago, 10,000 apps were using MAX as a software platform to manage their ad monetization. As of the end of Q3, that number is almost 30,000 and growing rapidly. We believe our unified platform should surpass $15 billion in advertiser spend across all industry bidders entering 2023. This would make our exchange one of the largest advertising ecosystems in the world. With that, I'll hand it off to Herald to walk you through our financial details. Thanks Steven. And really this ties back to some of the stuff I was saying in the lead in, but we're really excited about the many year outlook on the software business, because AXON is just a year old and it's really easy to forget that in our business. And machine learning platforms get much more precise over time as they accumulate more data and more opportunity. When we started the platform a year ago, we only had in the hundreds of specs. Now, we have 280. Imagine a machine learning software that had one, it couldn't personalize or matchmake very accurately in terms of what it was going to show a customer. Well, we have 280 customers that are spending a substantial amount with us and getting exceptional performance. So, what we're most excited about is bringing more customers online, will give the platform the capacity to become more personalized in the offering, and then that'll drive up pricing because it'll also drive up competition. We think that can lead to an immense amount of growth over the next decade. Thanks Tim. MoPub itself as a platform has been in the market for about a decade. They built out a lot of tools. They catered a much broader set of demand. Tools that that are successful tools for agencies and brands to bring demand into the mobile marketplace, as well as a robust set of DSPs. Pretty much every DSP in mobile was working with our marketplace. When we launched MAX three years ago, we took a different approach and built a lightweight platform that was really automated and pure for the mobile game developer. And MAX has we've noticed has grown immensely. It's processing around $5 billion of advertising spent a year right now on the platform. What we didn't do was layer on this incremental functionality that would bring even more demand into the ecosystem. By bringing MoPub supply in, we'll expand the supply to get to a point of late next year, what we think is a target of over $15 billion of ad spend, which makes it one of the largest platforms in the world. When you have a platform that big, it attracts demand and we'll be combining in the unified solution the MoPub products that to go attract that demand over and we think once that happens, the whole platform will accelerate and grow. 100%. MoPub works with both games and non-games. And a lot of these technologies and products that they built for a broader set of demand appealed to non-gaming just as much as gaming. So, we're going to go after the entire mobile app ecosystem with this this integration and unified solution. Yes, I'll go reverse order just so I can remember. MAX, in marketplace discussions and talking about a unified MAX MoPub platform, the reception has been exceptionally positive, both in terms of advertisers and publishers. MoPub itself, as part of Twitter, wasn't a focused product. It's been a long-term product that had a lot of retained customers for many years. But there hadn't been a lot of innovation and product investment the way we do when we're focused on a product that's core to our business. And so as we've spoken to the publishers, there's a lot of excitement about the possibility of bringing the two platforms together, and tapping into this immense scale and incremental demand, which we think will create more competition, more publisher yield, and more growth in the ecosystem for all parties that intersect with it. On the first question, the IDFA impact in the marketplace, as you saw in our numbers and a lot of advertising platforms, advertising quarter-over-quarter was mostly muted in terms of growth. So, there is loss in terms of targeting that's possible with IDFA going away, and publisher CPMs did diminish on iOS, that was offset on the publishing side with gains on Android as demand shifted over there. Now, our platform, we have an advantage in the marketplace because of our scaled first-party data that fuels our AXON machine learning system. And as prices came down and competition lessoned, our platform stood stronger than others. And that's what allowed us to grow faster than others. That paired with the fact that we were already on a really fast growth trajectory because of AXON quarter-over-quarter for the last few quarters and that continues to accelerate led to the strong quarter. So, on the first question, obviously, to grow a business as quickly as we are, it could be the possibility of technological enhancement, more customers or share gains. We think we've gotten -- we've executed across all three of those factors. And you almost have to to be able to grow as much as we did quarter-over-quarter. Companies that depend on identity, lose more when the ID goes away, especially when that identity is built on third-party data. Our identity and our datasets and models are built on our first-party data. And so we ended up in a very advantaged position. We're also starting from a very low point of penetration with customers. When you talk about a business that's getting as big as ours as quickly as it is, and only having 280 software platform enterprise clients, it leaves a lot of room for growth. So, we were already executing on all vectors coming in. IDFA changes help decrease competition in the market. Our business model has advantages that are going to be hard for others to overcome. And we continue to accelerate through it. Now, the market is just green field for us and there's going to be more customers that are going to come on our platform is as a unified MAX and MoPub supply, there are very few add opportunities in the world at the scale of $15 billion a year of ad spend flowing through one single access point and our exchange will be that and so we're really excited about the future prospects of this business. In terms of games and evergreen titles, we touched on this last quarter, we do invest heavily in games -- in game development and in particular, organic releases of games, there's going to be a focus going forward. In order to continue to facilitate growth in our software business, data is key and first-party data, as we've touched on is really important. So, we do want to keep our content fresh. Over the quarter, we launched three titles, that took half the investment. And what we call an evergreen title is one that we think will get to $100 million plus a year revenue run rate and cost multiple millions of dollars to develop. We launched three of those in the quarter; Ace Defender, Bermuda Farm, Jackpot Master Slot. All three we believe over the next year, we'll go and achieve the $100 million a year run right and will be titles that will engage players for years to come. As we continue to invest in our workforce, now 3,000 roughly creators around the world, we're really going to invest behind developing our own content, organically releasing them in a high amount of frequency, and continuing to fuel growth on the app side and more fresh data coming in, that we can then go monetize on our highly successful software platform. The new enterprise clients in large part still are a lot of clients that are just spending more on our platform and tipping the threshold. If you've got 250% roughly net dollar retention, a lot of those customers as Herald touched on 8,000 in the system, will continue to cross over into the threshold and grow because the solution is just working so well for even the smaller clients in our system. The Adjust cross-sell opportunity -- and really instead of calling it that, I'd like to think of it as our salesforce is bringing new customers on board as well. And we didn't touch on this, but just one data point that that's exciting for us is that non-gaming customers quarter-over-quarter, Q3 versus Q2 grew almost 100%. It was our fastest growing vertical. Now, we don't break that out formally yet. It's still too small in the overall grand scheme of all of our numbers. But it is a huge growth opportunity. And as we bring that MoPub supply online and integrate it with our MAX supply and create that amount of scale both across gaming and non-gaming publishers, we think that non-gaming category is going to be very compelling. We've also recently put out a couple of case studies that highlight new non-gaming customers coming on our platform and seeing a lot of success. So, going forward, we expect that to continue to be a growing part of our new specs coming online. So, clients tend to only use one because these platforms are pretty robust and fairly complicated to integrate. But we're a fan of there being more options for publishers. The more options there are in the marketplace, the more innovation there is, both in terms of demand partners, and in terms of publishing partners. What we're focused on is delivering the best solution for publishers. And we put out a blog actually on AppLovin blog yesterday that we link to off the Shareholder Letter that shows you how fast MAX has been growing. We launched it three years ago. In three years, it's grown to be one of the largest platforms in the marketplace, and almost 30,000 apps have integrated this platform. And as I touched on, they don't usually use another one at the same time. So, you can think of it as almost exclusive integration. The MoPub clients coming over will take that scale and create a lot more, roughly double, and both in terms of apps, audience, and dollar spent through the platform. And so we're really excited about the possibility of unifying the platforms, the products that we're going to be able to enable, and the gains that publishers and advertisers will see from all of that. And so we're very focused on executing our vision going forward. Yes, let me answer the second one, the business question, and then Herald will touch on the usage of new capital in the quarter. The driving factors for dollars growing on specs in the platform or really it's very simple. It's just efficiency. Customers are buying on our platform on a performance basis. They're either buying, targeting a specific return on ad spend or they're buying targeting a cost per subscriber, a cost per first food order, cost per purchaser, but it is some function of a goal that they have, so they go and target. As customers spend more, they put more data into our system and our system gets more efficient. As it gets more efficient, they want to put more dollars into the system. So, it just creates a very sticky product that gets them to have a desire to continue to invest more dollars into the platform and that's what you saw this quarter, with just quarter-over-quarter, the same clients growing 13% in the dollars that they spent. Now, again, we only have 280 specs in the system. As we get more competition in the platform, if customers are getting the results that they want and competition goes up, inevitably, they're going to have to price more aggressively to continue to spend at a more accelerated clip. And those two factors combined create a function that creates growth on both numbers. And so that's what we're very excited about. That's been a formula that's fueled ad ecosystems that have become very big over time. Consistently, as you add competition, you create growth and so that's the inflection point that we're at. We've got the salesforce, we're bringing the MoPub team as well, super sophisticated team. They'll be able to sell to agencies and DSPs and a lot of app developers. Our own team will be selling app developers. And so we think as more clients come in, everything's going to go up into the right from here for many years to come. And Herald can touch on the use of the cash. So, our scaled first-party data is much more important to fuel the growth of our software side. It helps inform the models on what the users are interested in, and what other users that are similar to them are interested in. And that's really what's fueling the success on the software side. So, that first-party data doesn't inform what we do on the app development side. Actually, for years, our goal on app development was to go partner with studios across every genre of mobile gaming that we believed we can grow. And many of these studios were early in their growth cycle and -- so we went out, partnered with them, helped facilitate growth, that scaled data across an interest category to us. That data then feeds into our software engine and that's fueled a lot of the growth. We now are at a point where with numerous studios, almost 20 around the world, and 3,000 creators, we've got expertise across every major mobile gaming category. So, we're very excited about where we're at. And now we're investing into taking the current games and continuing to expand them and creating new games and organically releasing them into the market. And so long as we execute on that, we'll continue to have scaled data feeding into our engine that we're monetizing exceptionally well. It gives us access to more potential clients, both for Adjust an AppDiscovery and obviously, the unified mediation platform. The MoPub team is also very seasoned. So, they'll integrate with our team, salesforce will integrate the will create a unified offering, both in terms of publisher sales and advertiser sales. And we think just reach an access of market leading solutions across attribution, growth, and discovery and monetization will let us go get in front of every single major company in the space, which should facilitate more sales. Well, we'll get there soon, Clark, but right now, what you should think about is what are the assets that we have in place and what else can we do with that? Because that's what guides our thought around new initiatives. And we launched AXON machine learning engine a year ago, and you've seen really dramatic growth on software. We went from 200 years ago to talk about 600 plus this year to over a billion next year, and accelerating and that's offer is working really well in a highly competitive ad ecosystem. What else can that type of machine learning be applied to is something we will always ask ourselves and that can guide us. Another way we think about it is we go out and monetize mobile app inventory right now, predominantly using full screen video ads. What are were other places where the consumers that we have data on at in this first-party data, that we can go find those consumers and serve them video ads, using our software engine to create scale and grow. So, that's another way to think about it and what we think about. And then the third and most important maybe, is our audience is around 200 million monthly actives playing our mobile games. We've got 3,000 game developers, building content for our platform. The audience of our own network isn't the $2 billion -- 2 billion users a month. So, it's a massively scaled audience of mobile game players and then mobile game developers both building games for us and third-party clients of ours. If we can use that reach that audience those games, to then go after some of the newer opportunities in terms of usage and gameplay and ownership to the consumer and things like Metaverse and blockchain that could also be interesting. And so we think about all of these things. We think we've got very exciting assets in place to really go after these opportunities and over the next couple of years, we hope you'll see us execute on many of the above."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks Adam and thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us today. As you can hear from Adam, we're extremely pleased with the performance of the business in the quarter, continuing on the strong momentum we saw in the first half of the year and we feel like we're very well-positioned for growth in the fourth quarter next year and beyond. In Q3, year-over-year, we did grow total revenue 90% and EBITDA more than doubled year-over-year. We were able to drive 26% EBITDA margins and have another rule of -- number that's well under three digits. As Adam noted, our software performance was exceptional and I wanted to highlight a few more details that you'll find in our Shareholder Letter. Even when excluding adjusted, software platform revenue quadrupled versus last year and increased organically by 316%. It's due to the efficacy of our software solutions that's clear to the market, adding both the number of specs that we added as well as increasing the take rate we're getting from each one of those specs. Software now represents 27% of our overall revenue and as our software grows, that drives margins and cash flow that can be reinvested in our business. On the app side, the portfolio grew 56% year-over-year, a very solid performance and our maps increased quarter-over-quarter as well. While this is strong performance from an application standpoint, this really helps to generate more scale first party data, which is a key component or AXON Machine Learning Engine, which as you know, powers our software platform. Note, this extra cash flow that we've been generating from software allows us to reinvest in our business across the board, including studio development capacity and investments in Q3, where we invest in behind a robust slate of future titles. As Adam mentioned, we continue to see positive tailwinds in our business and are excited about our expanding market and strategic and financial position soon entering 2022. As we talked about in the second quarter, our outlook for software is to reach over $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2022. That's over a 60% year-over-year growth over our $600 million target also offered in the second quarter. Now, on top of that, with a pending acquisition of MoPub, that would add an incremental $240 million to $260 million of revenue run rate exiting 2022 and would have very minimal costs at about $40 million. As discussed, we're waiting for regulatory approval to determine the timing of the close of that transaction. Before we take your questions, Adam and I are pleased to also announce that Alyssa Harvey Dawson has joined our Board of Directors. Alyssa is currently the Chief Legal Officer at Gusto, a modern HR software platform. Her deep experience in past roles across tech and consumer verticals will be highly accretive to our Board. We're also pleased to announce that our Board member Cathy Sun joined AppLovin full time this past summer to help lead new initiatives. Given her new role in the Board, she'll be stepping down from the Board -- she has stepped down from our Board this past meeting. With that, I'll turn it over to Ryan to help organize some questions. Thanks Youssef. Maybe I'll start and Adam you can add on and take in reverse order. Just in terms of the number of specs that we do break it out for you in the Shareholder Letter, we articulate that excluding Adjust, we have 280 specs on our AppLovin software, excluding Adjust and in the second quarter, we had 237. So that run rate, you're right is about additional 40 excluding Adjust. Now, Adjust obviously give us access to their salesforce, they're cross-selling our solutions, and ended on themselves by the way that the Adjust product for attribution is growing and adding spec count as well, that gets us to the total of 449. So, we're excited by that progress. We're excited by that salesforce. Ultimately, if we're able to close MoPub, that obviously goes a lot more bandwidth in terms of team as well as technology to sell as well. So, I think that's a good run rate for us to continue to execute against that 40-plus specs for AppLovin alone. It will start to get more confusing those as we do cross-sell, it'll be harder to determine. Was it really just an MoPub customer, as you know, we have over 8,000 customers on our platform, but only the 449, they're at the spec level today. So, there's a lot of existing customers that may not be viewed as new, but will become spec over time. And with your question regarding the software, we gave the guidance in the second quarter on software for the first time, we don't intend to update that guidance today. But as Adam said, we're extremely excited by the quarter-over-quarter growth rate, where we had the 18% increase and 13% increase in price quantity respectively. And we think that momentum will continue as Adjust salesforce continues to ramp our technology, our machine learning engine continues to improve and with scale machine learning engines also improve. So as we add on to the platform, there is a virtuous cycle to that improvement. And then hopefully with MoPub in 2022, sometime, we will be able to accelerate it from there. I think our plan would be to update guidance in general, including talking about our software number when we report the fourth quarter numbers early next year. Yes. Thanks Adam and thanks matt for the question. Look overall, is everyone else in the M&A side, we continue to be on the lookout for the right strategic acquisitions to drive long-term growth. We know we're looking for, we know what assets are worth and so allows us to move quickly with speed and certainty on what want to own and then not waste time on things that don't fit our criteria. Because in the gaming, we've got a fairly comprehensive portfolio now and with a strong first-party data, however, we certainly want to augment that as we can. And in the quarter, we did find of that number, there was one asset that was about $150 million of an asset app purchase, that was included another casual game app that fits well in our portfolio. That was the majority of the spend in the quarter. But we'll continue to be on the hunt for those assets. We're not super-focused on adding apps, particularly given the elevated pricing in the market, but we'll certainly be looking -- and then on the software side, as you can tell, particularly with the MoPub deal, we're looking for the right strategic opportunities there as well."

Adam?\nAdam Foroughi: Thank you, Ryan. We are excited to have you on the AppLovin team. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope each one of you has an opportunity to read the Shareholder Letter we posted this afternoon, highlighting our second quarter business and financial performance. This is the second earnings period we have had as a public company, and once again, I am extremely proud of the strong execution by our teams this quarter, which resulted in our record financial performance. In the Q1 earnings call, we spoke a lot about how software powered by our first-party data advantage was excelling in the marketplace. Today, we are very proud to give you data that will show you the significant gains we have had in the software business since then. Consumers are downloading roughly 150 billion apps a year and probably half of those through organic discovery on the app stores themselves. Through AppLovin software platforms in the first half of the year, consumers downloaded almost 2 billion installs. Our market share is growing and we have become one of the largest platforms for developers to market to consumers. I will touch on two topics that demonstrate our strength. First is a tremendous performance and prospects for our software business. Since the launch of our machine learning engine AXON, our software platform revenue growth has accelerated for three consecutive quarters. And during the second quarter our software platform revenue more than tripled year-over-year. Improvement in the efficacy of our software has also accelerated customer adoption. In the second quarter, we tripled the number of software platform enterprise customers or SPECs to 366. We also saw significant growth in spend with net dollar based retention of 279% from our existing SPECs. Even when we exclude Adjust growth was just as impressive with SPECs more than doubling to 237 and software revenue more than troubling. Our average quarterly revenue per SPEC excluding Adjust was also up 51% year-over-year to an all-time high. We are focused on growing our client base, which in turn drives up pricing in our marketplace. As with most software businesses ours included, there is a high flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA. This material growth led to us achieving record EBITDA performance. Looking forward we are excited to be integrating the Adjust team into our business. Here is a simple way to think about this opportunity. If every one of the 250 sales and marketing people on the Adjust team convert just one client out of their 3,000 clients in the next year into an AL SPEC our software business will double. Given the favorable growth the margin profile of our software business, we believe it will be a key driver of our long-term value creation. The second point I\u2019d like to highlight is our differentiated approach to mobile content. We are unlike traditional mobile gaming publishers. Our top priority is to generate scaled first-party data across a wide audience. Larger scale and first-party data enhances our targeting capabilities, ultimately leading to the exceptional growth in our higher margin software business as we saw this quarter. We have invested heavily in us over the past three years and now have an annualize revenue of more than $2 billion, growing this business organically 80% year-over-year. Even more importantly, we have one of the largest pools in mobile development talent in the world, with close to 3,000 content creators across 16 global studios with expertise in nearly all popular mobile gaming categories, building content exclusively for us. We were the number one publisher globally by downloads in the second quarter according to SensorTower. While many of the gaming teams we have invested in are relatively new to AppLovin, the majority of those teams have been working tirelessly on new content. We have a handful of new evergreen titles planned for launch in the second half of the year. We use the term evergreen for titles that we believe can have a meaningful impact on our P&L at over $100 million of annual revenue for many years. This pipeline of content and ability to scale more hits like Project Makeover, Wordscapes and many others is what makes us very confident in the prospects of this business for years to come. To summarize, we had a great second quarter. Our record performance was a result of our unique and integrated business model powered by our strong technology and a great team. The fact that our business and our software run rate grew organically year-over-year faster than any other scaled advertising solution, despite what many in our industry anticipated would be a significant growth headwind with regards to data privacy due to the unique insights afforded to our software engine from our proprietary first-party data, our market share gains and to those tremendous opportunity for growth ahead of us. Now before I hand it off to Herald to highlight financial performance, I\u2019d also like to announce that Asha Sharma has recently joined our Board of Directors. Asha is the COO of InstaCart and has held successful senior roles at Facebook, Porch and Microsoft. She\u2019s a proven tech operator and leader and we are very excited to be working with her. With that, I will pass it to Herald.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for taking time to join us. Our business performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, result driven by the hard work and focus of the global AppLovin team. This momentum and awesome team bolsters our confidence in AppLovin\u2019s integrated strategic approach to the market, namely software fueled by scaled content and data, and in turn, our confidence for future growth and expansion. In addition to all the excellent growth metrics already mentioned by Adam, I\u2019d like to highlight a few additional points from the quarter. First on the software side, our total software transaction value or TSTV grew over 4x year-over-year in the second quarter to an annual run rate of approximately $900 million. That makes us one of the largest and fastest growing players in the category. As a reminder, TSTV which we launched in the first quarter adds back our eliminated intercompany revenue from owned and operated marketing spend. If we do that in order to give you a comparison of the total scale of our software business on an absolute basis and compared to our peers. An additional point on software, although early we are pleased with the progress we are making on our software platform with non-gaming customers, where revenue more than doubled in the second quarter compared to the first. One relevant customer case study is posted on our website, highlighting our success for an app called Fastic. A leading fasting app where we drove 125% increase in installs. Of note, Adjust whose large customer base is well over half non-gaming will also accelerate our growth in this category. Next, as Adam mentioned, we doubled the apps business year-over-year and have a strong pipeline of new evergreen games coming in the short-term. I want to emphasize and highlight the scale and depth of both our apps portfolio and our development capabilities, which gives us strong diversification business model durability and paths for organic growth in this business. With regard to cash flow, as Adam mentioned, we delivered record adjusted EBITDA. We grew more than 200% year-over-year and over 40% quarter-over-quarter to $184 million. Margins improved to 27%. A big reason for this expansion is the growth of our software platform, which operates at a much higher margin than our apps related businesses. Therefore their software business grows that can drive meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth and margin. One last quick highlight, our combined Q2 revenue growth and EBITDA margin led us to a rule of measure of 150%. Moving to 2021 outlook, we have strong momentum in the -- in for the second half of 2021 and we are confident that we can deliver against our organic financial outlook provided previously, which was revenue between $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $680 million to $700 million. Importantly, we see several opportunities for added growth over the next several quarters, in particular given the strong momentum in software and from all the investments we made over the past few quarters and years to grow our apps business. Again thanks for taking time today. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Oh! Hi. Thank you. This is David Karnovsky on for Alexia. Adam, your software business clearly accelerating here amid IDFA changes, can you just talk through some of the drivers, what do you think software clients sort of see in your platform versus competing networks or some of the walled garden channels? And then can you just discuss a little bit more the integration of the Adjust, what\u2019s been the experience so far utilizing their sales force customer at your core services and have you found that Adjust can serve as an entry point to new developers that are sort of starting out at launching their games? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Great. So the software side obviously is seeing a lot of acceleration and we touched on it last quarter when we highlighted what we thought IDFA impact would be. The changes really govern how third-party share data with first-party and how that data is used for advertising. And in our case we have a lot of first-party data, both scaled 200 million users a month playing our games, scaled across engagement data and then also scaled transactional data, which is very unique. We have got millions of customers paying and having paid in our games. And then that data we are able to put in our machine learning engine AXON to come up with really add recommendations that drive much better performance for the advertiser. We rolled this out in Q4 of last year and you have seen immense amounts of growth on the software side, both in terms of the dollars that people are spending on our platform, which is reflective of the performance and in terms of new clients coming on which doubled year-over-year. We are very confident in this trend going forward. And then in terms of the integration of Adjust, we closed that late April. So through Q2 it was more a work of just integrating them into the team, getting them up to speed on how our software solutions operate. The average ticket size on an Adjust client is tens of thousands a year. Our average ticket size is AppLovin on a software client is roughly $2 million a year of net reported revenue. And as you all know typical ad network margins you can grow set up by a factor of three or possibly even more to figure out how much a typical advertiser is spending on our platform per year. And we look at Adjust and I touch on this a second ago, as an opportunity to go convert 3,000 clients to become AppLovin SPECs and we even convert 7% of those clients to become AppLovin SPECs in the next year we will double our software business.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Great. And maybe if I just squeeze in one more, just on the decision not to adjust your outlook after the strong quarter, maybe you could just talk through your philosophy that you laid out on the Shareholder Letter to set guidance just one time at the start of the year? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. That\u2019s, I would say is a me thing. I have been operating this business since I started it. Really looking forward with our team to opportunities to execute on the technology and product side years ahead of where we are at and the present, and what we didn\u2019t want to get into is a pattern of trying to update numbers every single quarter and shifting our mindset from a long-term focus that we know creates the most long-term shareholder value to one that\u2019s more short-term focused. Obviously, our business is performing exceptionally well. We have got a lot of assets in place that we believe will give us a path to growth for many quarters and years to come, and so we are very confident that we will continue to put up very strong numbers. But we decided financial guidance should match the way we operate and we will update those annually for you, unless we are going to diverge materially from that guidance.\nDavid Karnovsky: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Hey. Thank you so much. So, Adam, as a follow up question for Adjust, I guess, you are calling out 2,000 gaming and non-gaming marketers spending $11 billion in mobile ad dollars. So you know can you talk about what incremental work do you think you need to do in order to gain more wallet share there? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks Stephen. It\u2019s interesting, because the reason we got really excited to do this transaction and it was frankly really difficult to do during the IPO process, but we felt like we had to do it is. We went and crossed our clients with Adjust clients and there was almost no overlap. Adjust has a team that\u2019s based in Berlin and then really they invested going east from there. So a lot of their clients are international and we realized without a sales force, we just didn\u2019t have any sort of penetration into this international client base. We didn\u2019t even know who these customers were and obviously they are huge mobile marketers. So that\u2019s what got us really excited. We saw just greenfield to go operate. We have got 3,000 almost clients that they have got and probably 500 plus of those are big enough to become AppLovin SPECs. So it\u2019s just not going to take a lot of work for us to go convince them if they are already spending substantial dollars on mobile marketing to test out our platform. It\u2019s low cost and then creates massive amounts of upside, and Herald, touched on the case of Fastic, which was one of the earliest Adjust cross sells. But it\u2019s something we are going to be investing heavily into going forward, because it\u2019s such an easy path for us to go tackle to create immense amounts of growth in that software business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. I am going to apologize in advance, if this is a dumb question because I confess I am still trying to wrap my head around the new KPI that you gave last quarter. But the software platform revenue year-over-year grew from $41 million to $146 million, up $105 million, but business apps revenue went from $96 million to $162 million, up only $66 million. Is there something in the middle there that is worth highlighting that may have shrunk?\nAdam Foroughi: So business apps, just to be clear is, advertising from third-party typically ad networks within our own mobile game applications and then business software is obviously are our app discovery solution and the max solution, and now Adjust, so the software and net revenue that we report. That business grew exceptionally quickly with the advantages that we thought we had going into the changing landscape. One of the things we touched on in the first quarter earnings call is, our other prediction on IDFA changes where the prices in the ecosystem would drop on iOS and that flows through to business publishing. Now despite that, business publishing had a quite sizable growth. The mobile gaming ecosystem doesn\u2019t tend to grow that quickly on a year-over-year basis, so despite the lower pricing in the ecosystem, we still were able to generate outsized growth in that business as well.\nHerald Chen: And maybe I can add on to that.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\nHerald Chen: Yeah. So we -- within the business category, originally we had the apps and the software. We broke it out pretty for you before, but now we are explicitly showing the number of customers on the software side. We still in the disclosure have the enterprise customers, which would total up to the aggregate business revenue, which includes both the business apps revenue and the software revenue. Business apps revenues you will see in the letter grew 70% in the quarter, and then, of course, the software side grew to a much faster rate of 256%\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Can I ask maybe one other dumb question. If I take the clients to generate over $125,000 spend per quarter, if I multiply those two numbers together and I compare it to the software platform revenue, it used to be sort of like a rounding error. In this quarter, it jumped up whereas like $113 million or something like that. Is that from the Adjust acquisition or are you beginning to get more traction from business accounts to generate less than $125,000, what\u2019s becoming sort of a larger number? Thanks.\nHerald Chen: Yeah. I can take that one as well. So, in the letter we do show you what the business did without Adjust and with Adjust. And so, without Adjust, the average SPEC client spent $150, $100, sorry, $519,000 in revenue for the quarter. So it was a much -- that\u2019s a much bigger increase over the prior quarter. Then, the Adjust SPECs, which is the incremental 129 customers, they do have a lower average. So the total overall average when you combine them was the 364.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nYoussef Squali: Hi. Great. Thank you and guys congrats on a solid quarter. So, two questions, one, a follow up on the Adjust acquisition. I was just wondering if maybe you can speak to the rollout of the or the cross selling potential of the -- of that 250 salespeople? And just kind of how quickly do you think you can ramp that up and kind of what\u2019s baked into your published guidance so far? And second, and obviously, the numbers speak for themselves, but just going back to IDFA, I was wondering if you can comment on the percentage of iOS users that have upgraded to 14.5 or later and what kind of impact have you seen either on opting rates or basically on that on that sliver of the business? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Youssef. I will answer the second first, just because it is quicker. We have seen about 80% of iOS devices are now updated to 14.5 or later and consent rates are coming in quite a bit higher than, I think, a lot of the folks in the industry had projected. It\u2019s different by app-by-app, but anywhere between 20% to 25% on the low end and 60% to 65% on the high end and it lands on an average to around 35% to 40% or opting into sharing information. So that\u2019s on IDFA changes. On the Adjust piece, again, Q2 was just integration, get the team trained up. It takes a little bit of time for clients to come on our platform and actually ramp up, because there\u2019s learning costs and a learning timeframe. So, really we will start seeing the effects of Adjust. Starting in Q3 really taking shape in Q4 and impacting next year quite materially. As such, we didn\u2019t project too much into our numbers at all from Adjust cross-sell this year. We are already starting to see though quite a lot of cross-selling activity happening, because frankly, it really isn\u2019t a hard sell. These are mobile marketers. They know how to spend dollars on mobile. They are performance buyers. And as I touched on in my summary too, we have grown to become such a big source of mobile traffic acquisition that it\u2019s really easy for their salespeople to convince one of their clients who hadn\u2019t heard of us before to go test on our platform.\nYoussef Squali: Okay.\nAdam Foroughi: And Herald, I don\u2019t know if you want, yeah, if you want to give anything explicit on the guidance there that we included in terms of Adjust?\nHerald Chen: In terms of the guidance we have done we are going to acquire Adjust at the time, so our guidance for the year we gave in the first quarter it was inclusive of that and the two acquisitions we announced in the first quarter.\nYoussef Squali: Got it. Okay.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So we included their numbers and not much outside from cross sell, so that creates quite a lot of upside for us in the future.\nYoussef Squali: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that clarification. That was actually important. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Cost: Hi, guys. It\u2019s Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess for the software platform I think you guys said in the letter you had about 40% organic growth sequentially versus 1Q. How did AXON contribute to that growth versus contextual products? And did that change at all in terms of like the strength and the contextual product as you move through the quarter and maybe more people were upgrading to iOS 14.5 or higher? And then, you mentioned, software gaining share -- continuing to gain share this quarter, who in the ecosystem do you think are the share donors at this stage? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Hi, Matt. So let me answer again second first, if it was top of mind. We think the ecosystem itself is still growing quite quickly, in our space in the last 24 hours you have seen Unity report great numbers, Iron Source see great numbers. We obviously reported industry-leading growth numbers with that triple-digit software growth and 40% sequentially. What we think is happening is that the marketing platforms are just improving and they are improving at a really quick pace, which increases the pie and it\u2019s not that we are taking from another company, it\u2019s that the market\u2019s growing, we are just outpacing the growth of the market, which is leading to all of the key players in the ecosystem though growing, as well as the publishers themselves who lean on advertising to grow their business. And then on the first one, the 40% growth sequentially, can you just rephrase the question for me, so I can remember exactly what to answer?\nMatt Cost: Oh! Yeah. Of course. It was just about the contribution to that growth from AXON versus contextual advertising it and you did\u2026\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I got. I got it. Yeah.\nMatt Cost: \u2026 shift may be towards the end?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So if you recall we touched on in first quarter earnings, our advantage we felt like going into the IDFA change was compared to our peers is that we weren\u2019t going to fall back from a completely personalized solution to a completely contextual solution that lacked the personalization you get with data. Our advantage truly comes from very scaled first-party data. We have got $200 million users playing games every single month that we have got good engagement data on. We have got millions of customers having paid us over the history of our gaming business. All of that data remains intact and -- in our models with or without IDFA, and so going into the quarter, we felt like we had advantages. We articulated it for you all in Q1. And then, obviously, you have seen in the step-up in performance that 3x growth in the software business and that 40% quarter-over-quarter and a huge ramp-up in clients that we are able to outperform in the marketplace because of those investments we have made over the last couple of years.\nMatt Cost: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Song with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nAngie Song: Hi. Thank you for taking my call. I am actually speaking on behalf of Martin Yang at Oppenheimer. Could you talk to us a little bit about your first party games pipeline for 2021 and entering into 2022? And are you planning on expanding into more genres or expanding market opportunities? And also what is your long-term revenue mix goal for first-party games versus software?\nAdam Foroughi: So, thanks for the question. The game pipeline itself, while we don\u2019t talk about games, because we operated as a portfolio, what we can tell you is this. We started the game this business three years ago roughly. But most of our investments and creators coming into our ecosystem to build content for us has really happened in the last 18 months. We have now got 3,000 roughly game creators around the world that are expertise across nearly every category of mobile gaming building content for us. Now we pulled out this notion of an evergreen title. These are titles that take a substantial amount of investment to go built usually in the millions of dollars of R&D cost, but also more importantly one year to two years of development time. Since our gaming business is so new, you haven\u2019t yet seen a pipeline of content rollout from us. Yet, we are working on it and you have seen it reflected in our expenses. The first game that came organically launched last year in November a Project Makeover and within two months was top 20 grossing globally mobile game, one of the fastest growing of all time. So what gets us really excited is that in the second half of the year we are now going to have a constant pipeline of big games rolling out, we will have a handful coming over the next few months that will launch. And we believe and have confidence in we will be able to clear this threshold that we define as an evergreen title at least $100 million of revenue per title per year with an outlook to many years to come of being able to generate that. And then, do you mind repeating the second question as well?\nHerald Chen: Mix of software and apps.\nAdam Foroughi: So, do you want to answer that one, Herald?\nHerald Chen: Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Look we are -- our strategy is to grow both sides of the business and be opportunistic where we can be. Of course, as you can see in this quarter, our software business has tremendous growth in a big market potential and so that business we see quite robust growth rates for quite a long time. On the IP side, look we have gone from zero to several billion dollars in less than three years. And as Adam just mentioned, a lot of that has come in the very recent few quarters and so that should be accelerating as well as we get more studios, launching new games. We improve our live ops behind those games. And over time, we don\u2019t target necessarily a mix. We are looking to grow both businesses as efficiently and as quickly as possible. Again, we see the software business though, now that it, given the margin structure as we mentioned will drive significant EBITDA and if it grows faster than apps, we will increase margins. And as a percentage of overall revenue, again not that we are targeting it, I think, we are 14% in 2020 for the year, in this quarter where software is now 22% of the business, because of the accelerated growth.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. And as that -- one thing to add to is as we -- as you think about the two revenue streams, the software revenue stream is just much higher value in terms of conversion to EBITDA. When you build games at least upfront with our strategy, we are generating scale. We are investing heavily in the user acquisition. Now, we have cost synergies and for that you can just take that TSTV number minus the third-party software reported revenue number. And that was annualized $300 million a year of UA savings that we have because of our integrated solutions. But still we are investing a lot and growing that gaming business because we want the audience. That software business, every incremental dollar is exceptionally high margin. So the way we look at our business is, if we can grow the software business really quickly, our EBITDA will continue to improve and that\u2019s why when you look at the numbers this quarter, yeah, you can take the revenue beat and the EBITDA beat, and you notice the dollar-for-dollar revenue beat almost entirely flows through to EBITDA and that\u2019s because software is performing so well.\nAngie Song: Great. Thanks for the color. Congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. We are excited to have you on the AppLovin team. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope each one of you has an opportunity to read the Shareholder Letter we posted this afternoon, highlighting our second quarter business and financial performance. This is the second earnings period we have had as a public company, and once again, I am extremely proud of the strong execution by our teams this quarter, which resulted in our record financial performance. In the Q1 earnings call, we spoke a lot about how software powered by our first-party data advantage was excelling in the marketplace. Today, we are very proud to give you data that will show you the significant gains we have had in the software business since then. Consumers are downloading roughly 150 billion apps a year and probably half of those through organic discovery on the app stores themselves. Through AppLovin software platforms in the first half of the year, consumers downloaded almost 2 billion installs. Our market share is growing and we have become one of the largest platforms for developers to market to consumers. I will touch on two topics that demonstrate our strength. First is a tremendous performance and prospects for our software business. Since the launch of our machine learning engine AXON, our software platform revenue growth has accelerated for three consecutive quarters. And during the second quarter our software platform revenue more than tripled year-over-year. Improvement in the efficacy of our software has also accelerated customer adoption. In the second quarter, we tripled the number of software platform enterprise customers or SPECs to 366. We also saw significant growth in spend with net dollar based retention of 279% from our existing SPECs. Even when we exclude Adjust growth was just as impressive with SPECs more than doubling to 237 and software revenue more than troubling. Our average quarterly revenue per SPEC excluding Adjust was also up 51% year-over-year to an all-time high. We are focused on growing our client base, which in turn drives up pricing in our marketplace. As with most software businesses ours included, there is a high flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA. This material growth led to us achieving record EBITDA performance. Looking forward we are excited to be integrating the Adjust team into our business. Here is a simple way to think about this opportunity. If every one of the 250 sales and marketing people on the Adjust team convert just one client out of their 3,000 clients in the next year into an AL SPEC our software business will double. Given the favorable growth the margin profile of our software business, we believe it will be a key driver of our long-term value creation. The second point I\u2019d like to highlight is our differentiated approach to mobile content. We are unlike traditional mobile gaming publishers. Our top priority is to generate scaled first-party data across a wide audience. Larger scale and first-party data enhances our targeting capabilities, ultimately leading to the exceptional growth in our higher margin software business as we saw this quarter. We have invested heavily in us over the past three years and now have an annualize revenue of more than $2 billion, growing this business organically 80% year-over-year. Even more importantly, we have one of the largest pools in mobile development talent in the world, with close to 3,000 content creators across 16 global studios with expertise in nearly all popular mobile gaming categories, building content exclusively for us. We were the number one publisher globally by downloads in the second quarter according to SensorTower. While many of the gaming teams we have invested in are relatively new to AppLovin, the majority of those teams have been working tirelessly on new content. We have a handful of new evergreen titles planned for launch in the second half of the year. We use the term evergreen for titles that we believe can have a meaningful impact on our P&L at over $100 million of annual revenue for many years. This pipeline of content and ability to scale more hits like Project Makeover, Wordscapes and many others is what makes us very confident in the prospects of this business for years to come. To summarize, we had a great second quarter. Our record performance was a result of our unique and integrated business model powered by our strong technology and a great team. The fact that our business and our software run rate grew organically year-over-year faster than any other scaled advertising solution, despite what many in our industry anticipated would be a significant growth headwind with regards to data privacy due to the unique insights afforded to our software engine from our proprietary first-party data, our market share gains and to those tremendous opportunity for growth ahead of us. Now before I hand it off to Herald to highlight financial performance, I\u2019d also like to announce that Asha Sharma has recently joined our Board of Directors. Asha is the COO of InstaCart and has held successful senior roles at Facebook, Porch and Microsoft. She\u2019s a proven tech operator and leader and we are very excited to be working with her. With that, I will pass it to Herald. Great. So the software side obviously is seeing a lot of acceleration and we touched on it last quarter when we highlighted what we thought IDFA impact would be. The changes really govern how third-party share data with first-party and how that data is used for advertising.

And we look at Adjust and I touch on this a second ago, as an opportunity to go convert 3,000 clients to become AppLovin SPECs and we even convert 7% of those clients to become AppLovin SPECs in the next year we will double our software business. Yeah. That\u2019s, I would say is a me thing. I have been operating this business since I started it. Really looking forward with our team to opportunities to execute on the technology and product side years ahead of where we are at and the present, and what we didn\u2019t want to get into is a pattern of trying to update numbers every single quarter and shifting our mindset from a long-term focus that we know creates the most long-term shareholder value to one that\u2019s more short-term focused.

The mobile gaming ecosystem doesn\u2019t tend to grow that quickly on a year-over-year basis, so despite the lower pricing in the ecosystem, we still were able to generate outsized growth in that business as well. Thanks, Youssef. I will answer the second first, just because it is quicker. We have seen about 80% of iOS devices are now updated to 14.5 or later and consent rates are coming in quite a bit higher than, I think, a lot of the folks in the industry had projected. It\u2019s different by app-by-app, but anywhere between 20% to 25% on the low end and 60% to 65% on the high end and it lands on an average to around 35% to 40% or opting into sharing information. So that\u2019s on IDFA changes. On the Adjust piece, again, Q2 was just integration, get the team trained up. It takes a little bit of time for clients to come on our platform and actually ramp up, because there\u2019s learning costs and a learning timeframe. So, really we will start seeing the effects of Adjust. Starting in Q3 really taking shape in Q4 and impacting next year quite materially. As such, we didn\u2019t project too much into our numbers at all from Adjust cross-sell this year. We are already starting to see though quite a lot of cross-selling activity happening, because frankly, it really isn\u2019t a hard sell. These are mobile marketers. They know how to spend dollars on mobile. They are performance buyers. And as I touched on in my summary too, we have grown to become such a big source of mobile traffic acquisition that it\u2019s really easy for their salespeople to convince one of their clients who hadn\u2019t heard of us before to go test on our platform. And Herald, I don\u2019t know if you want, yeah, if you want to give anything explicit on the guidance there that we included in terms of Adjust? Yeah. So we included their numbers and not much outside from cross sell, so that creates quite a lot of upside for us in the future. Hi, Matt. So let me answer again second first, if it was top of mind. We think the ecosystem itself is still growing quite quickly, in our space in the last 24 hours you have seen Unity report great numbers, Iron Source see great numbers. We obviously reported industry-leading growth numbers with that triple-digit software growth and 40% sequentially. What we think is happening is that the marketing platforms are just improving and they are improving at a really quick pace, which increases the pie and it\u2019s not that we are taking from another company, it\u2019s that the market\u2019s growing, we are just outpacing the growth of the market, which is leading to all of the key players in the ecosystem though growing, as well as the publishers themselves who lean on advertising to grow their business. And then on the first one, the 40% growth sequentially, can you just rephrase the question for me, so I can remember exactly what to answer? Yeah. I got. I got it. Yeah. Yeah. So if you recall we touched on in first quarter earnings, our advantage we felt like going into the IDFA change was compared to our peers is that we weren\u2019t going to fall back from a completely personalized solution to a completely contextual solution that lacked the personalization you get with data. Our advantage truly comes from very scaled first-party data. We have got $200 million users playing games every single month that we have got good engagement data on. We have got millions of customers having paid us over the history of our gaming business. All of that data remains intact and -- in our models with or without IDFA, and so going into the quarter, we felt like we had advantages. We articulated it for you all in Q1. And then, obviously, you have seen in the step-up in performance that 3x growth in the software business and that 40% quarter-over-quarter and a huge ramp-up in clients that we are able to outperform in the marketplace because of those investments we have made over the last couple of years. So, thanks for the question. The game pipeline itself, while we don\u2019t talk about games, because we operated as a portfolio, what we can tell you is this. We started the game this business three years ago roughly. But most of our investments and creators coming into our ecosystem to build content for us has really happened in the last 18 months. We have now got 3,000 roughly game creators around the world that are expertise across nearly every category of mobile gaming building content for us. Now we pulled out this notion of an evergreen title. These are titles that take a substantial amount of investment to go built usually in the millions of dollars of R&D cost, but also more importantly one year to two years of development time. Since our gaming business is so new, you haven\u2019t yet seen a pipeline of content rollout from us. Yet, we are working on it and you have seen it reflected in our expenses. The first game that came organically launched last year in November a Project Makeover and within two months was top 20 grossing globally mobile game, one of the fastest growing of all time. So what gets us really excited is that in the second half of the year we are now going to have a constant pipeline of big games rolling out, we will have a handful coming over the next few months that will launch. And we believe and have confidence in we will be able to clear this threshold that we define as an evergreen title at least $100 million of revenue per title per year with an outlook to many years to come of being able to generate that. And then, do you mind repeating the second question as well? So, do you want to answer that one, Herald? Yeah. And as that -- one thing to add to is as we -- as you think about the two revenue streams, the software revenue stream is just much higher value in terms of conversion to EBITDA. When you build games at least upfront with our strategy, we are generating scale. We are investing heavily in the user acquisition. Now, we have cost synergies and for that you can just take that TSTV number minus the third-party software reported revenue number. And that was annualized $300 million a year of UA savings that we have because of our integrated solutions. But still we are investing a lot and growing that gaming business because we want the audience. That software business, every incremental dollar is exceptionally high margin. So the way we look at our business is, if we can grow the software business really quickly, our EBITDA will continue to improve and that\u2019s why when you look at the numbers this quarter, yeah, you can take the revenue beat and the EBITDA beat, and you notice the dollar-for-dollar revenue beat almost entirely flows through to EBITDA and that\u2019s because software is performing so well."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for taking time to join us. Our business performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, result driven by the hard work and focus of the global AppLovin team. This momentum and awesome team bolsters our confidence in AppLovin\u2019s integrated strategic approach to the market, namely software fueled by scaled content and data, and in turn, our confidence for future growth and expansion. In addition to all the excellent growth metrics already mentioned by Adam, I\u2019d like to highlight a few additional points from the quarter. First on the software side, our total software transaction value or TSTV grew over 4x year-over-year in the second quarter to an annual run rate of approximately $900 million. That makes us one of the largest and fastest growing players in the category. As a reminder, TSTV which we launched in the first quarter adds back our eliminated intercompany revenue from owned and operated marketing spend. If we do that in order to give you a comparison of the total scale of our software business on an absolute basis and compared to our peers. An additional point on software, although early we are pleased with the progress we are making on our software platform with non-gaming customers, where revenue more than doubled in the second quarter compared to the first. One relevant customer case study is posted on our website, highlighting our success for an app called Fastic. A leading fasting app where we drove 125% increase in installs. Of note, Adjust whose large customer base is well over half non-gaming will also accelerate our growth in this category. Next, as Adam mentioned, we doubled the apps business year-over-year and have a strong pipeline of new evergreen games coming in the short-term. I want to emphasize and highlight the scale and depth of both our apps portfolio and our development capabilities, which gives us strong diversification business model durability and paths for organic growth in this business. With regard to cash flow, as Adam mentioned, we delivered record adjusted EBITDA. We grew more than 200% year-over-year and over 40% quarter-over-quarter to $184 million. Margins improved to 27%. A big reason for this expansion is the growth of our software platform, which operates at a much higher margin than our apps related businesses. Therefore their software business grows that can drive meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth and margin. One last quick highlight, our combined Q2 revenue growth and EBITDA margin led us to a rule of measure of 150%. Moving to 2021 outlook, we have strong momentum in the -- in for the second half of 2021 and we are confident that we can deliver against our organic financial outlook provided previously, which was revenue between $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $680 million to $700 million. Importantly, we see several opportunities for added growth over the next several quarters, in particular given the strong momentum in software and from all the investments we made over the past few quarters and years to grow our apps business. Again thanks for taking time today. Operator, please open the line for questions. And maybe I can add on to that. Yeah. So we -- within the business category, originally we had the apps and the software. We broke it out pretty for you before, but now we are explicitly showing the number of customers on the software side. We still in the disclosure have the enterprise customers, which would total up to the aggregate business revenue, which includes both the business apps revenue and the software revenue. Business apps revenues you will see in the letter grew 70% in the quarter, and then, of course, the software side grew to a much faster rate of 256% Yeah. I can take that one as well. So, in the letter we do show you what the business did without Adjust and with Adjust. And so, without Adjust, the average SPEC client spent $150, $100, sorry, $519,000 in revenue for the quarter. So it was a much -- that\u2019s a much bigger increase over the prior quarter. Then, the Adjust SPECs, which is the incremental 129 customers, they do have a lower average. So the total overall average when you combine them was the 364. In terms of the guidance we have done we are going to acquire Adjust at the time, so our guidance for the year we gave in the first quarter it was inclusive of that and the two acquisitions we announced in the first quarter. Mix of software and apps. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Look we are -- our strategy is to grow both sides of the business and be opportunistic where we can be. Of course, as you can see in this quarter, our software business has tremendous growth in a big market potential and so that business we see quite robust growth rates for quite a long time. On the IP side, look we have gone from zero to several billion dollars in less than three years. And as Adam just mentioned, a lot of that has come in the very recent few quarters and so that should be accelerating as well as we get more studios, launching new games. We improve our live ops behind those games. And over time, we don\u2019t target necessarily a mix. We are looking to grow both businesses as efficiently and as quickly as possible. Again, we see the software business though, now that it, given the margin structure as we mentioned will drive significant EBITDA and if it grows faster than apps, we will increase margins. And as a percentage of overall revenue, again not that we are targeting it, I think, we are 14% in 2020 for the year, in this quarter where software is now 22% of the business, because of the accelerated growth."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Tori Valenzuela, Chief Legal Office and Corporate Secretary for AppLovin. You may begin.\nVictoria Valenzuela: Thank you, and welcome to the AppLovin earnings call for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Joining me today to discuss AppLovin's results and key business initiatives are Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Herald Chen.  Before we begin, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results and guidance, strategy, long-term growth and margin targets and overall future prospects, the expected benefits of our acquisition of Adjust as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Apple's iOS 14.5 rollout. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we projected or implied during this call, in particular, those described in our risk factors included in our final prospectus related to our initial public offering filed on April 15, 2021 and in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2021 that will be filed following this call as well as the current uncertainty and unpredictability in our business, the markets and economy in general. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions and beliefs as of the date hereof, and AppLovin disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.

Finally, a recording of this conference call will also be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after this call has ended.  And now I'll turn it over to Adam.\nAdam Foroughi: Thank you for joining us today for our first public company earnings call. I want to begin by thanking our amazing teammates around the world who continue to push relentlessly to execute on our vision. Of course, we wouldn't be here without our partners who trust us as an integral part of their growth and monetization strategy. And thank you for the support from our new investors. We are very much focused on the long term and appreciate that you recognize our competitive advantages and long-term opportunities. We are looking forward to sharing details about AppLovin's first quarter results.  While I don't want to steal Herald's thunder by covering financial metrics, I do want to say that we are very proud of our record first quarter, growing revenue and EBITDA over 100% year-over-year. I also want to highlight the 3 primary objectives that we focus on in driving long-term growth. We review each objective in detail in our shareholder letter on the website, but I want to touch on each at a high level here.  First, we're a marketing software company that helps mobile app developers attract new users and grow their businesses. Our most important objective is to focus on growing our software platform, and our key business decisions always link back to this objective. We accelerated to 90% growth year-over-year in Q1 in our Business Software segment. Unlike many tech companies, the pandemic had negligible impact on our business since our audiences play casual games on the go. Our growth in the last 2 quarters was primarily driven by technological improvements from our machine learning engine, AXON, which we launched late in 2020 and continues to improve dramatically. These improvements helped us significantly grow our customer base and average revenue per customer.  We're also excited about closing the Adjust acquisition in April. The acquisition provides us access to their leading attribution analytics products, over 2,000 potential clients and a sales force for the first time in our company's history. With these new Adjust assets under AppLovin, we are excited to grow both their solutions and our AXON-powered software.  Our second objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of apps to generate more first-party data for AXON. Since 2018, we built a high-growth, diversified portfolio. Our combined business apps and consumer apps include over 200 games and nearly 40 million daily active users. We work with 15 studios around the globe that have a workforce of approximately 2,000 game creators.  Today, our apps are some of the world's most popular mobile games, including Project Makeover, Wordscapes, Matchington Mansion, Clockmaker, Bingo Story, Final Fantasy 15 and many others. We're able to grow these games because of our seasoned team, accretive M&A and, most importantly, our marketing expertise and cost synergies we get from marketing our apps on our software platform.  Our scaled first-party data advantage feeds our software engine and also insulates our business model from privacy changes relative to peers. We've already seen over 10% of iOS users update to iOS 14.5 or later, and within that audience, we're not seeing any material impact to our business.  Our third business objective as a platform business with high margins is to create shareholder value through long-term growth and increasing cash flows. We believe predictable growth and cash flow is the ultimate determinant of shareholder value. The combination of our machine learning software, our first-party data advantage and our massive TAM gives us confidence in our long-term annual cash flow growth target of over 30%.  We've made great progress in Q1 but believe we're just getting started. At AppLovin, we built market-leading tools that help our customers grow their businesses. We recently put all the pieces together in our business model that has evolved over a decade of investment. As you evaluate our results, we believe you will see the strength of our platform and why we're excited about our path of growth for years to come.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Herald.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us. As Adam mentioned, we appreciate that our business model is a bit nuanced. What we hope through this call, our shareholder letter, our first quarter results, our guidance and our financial performance over time is that you come to appreciate that our integrated model is the reason for our strong Q1 and for our confidence in our long-term growth prospects.  Before we get to your questions, I want to briefly highlight a few topics. We did have a very strong first quarter with 132% and 110% year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth, respectively. For those wanting to understand our mix of organic versus inorganic growth, our organic growth was a robust 89%.  Next, I want to discuss our software business, which falls under our business revenue. We wanted to provide you additional metrics regarding just our software business to help you understand the scale and growth drivers of that business.  The first is total software transaction value, a new metric for us. It measures and helps dimensionalize the scale of our software business. Our software is used by our first-party apps and third-party clients. However, we can't report our own spend on our own software under GAAP rules. So we measure TSTV, or total software transaction value, as the total net value transacted from all clients as if our own studios were stand-alone businesses. In Q1, this TST measure increased by 155% year-over-year to $148 million to nearly a $600 million run rate. That illustrates both the scale and rapid growth of our software platforms.  The second new metric is software platform enterprise clients. While we already report business enterprise clients' APIs on an annual basis, we think it would be helpful for investors to have price times quantity metrics for just the software business on a quarterly basis. Specs is the number of third-party software clients who, in a quarter, spend an annualized run rate revenue of over $125,000. We had 193 specs in the first quarter versus 130 in the first quarter of 2020, a 48% year-over-year increase with the average value per customer rising 32%. We grew both price and quantity primarily because of the improvements in AXON, which, in turn, increased the efficacy of our software.  On the content side, I'd summarize that we do have many structural and financial advantages on marketing spend, which simply lets us invest more in effective user acquisition spend than the market. Since in the mobile app market marketing dollars drives mobile app growth, we were able to rapidly grow our apps.  With respect to Adam's comment regarding long-term cash flow growth, we believe our strong rule-out performance ultimately will translate into long-term cash flow growth. We are targeting at 30-plus percent. In the letter, we have provided you with descriptions of our operating cost structures so you're better able to appreciate our ability to grow cash flows over time, in particular, as our software business continues to expand.  Turning to guidance. For full year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 85% to between $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion. For the full year 2021, we are guiding to adjusted EBITDA in the range of $680 million to $700 million, representing a doubling from the prior year. Our policy will be to provide you with fiscal year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA updating it quarterly.  With that, we're happy to answer your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. So Adam, I think it's only been about 9 short months since you switched over from contextual ads to AXON. And it seems like the benefits you get from ML and particularly as you keep feeding it more first-party data should continue to accrete over time. So what inning do you think you are in terms of the overall value you think you can extract?  And secondarily, just wondering what the M&A pipeline may look like at this point. Are deals getting more contested now? Or are the private market valuations [indiscernible] about where they are?\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Stephen, for the questions. And taking the first one. Really, ML, if you look at the success of all the biggest companies in the world today, whether it's Google or Facebook, you can tie their success over years back to the inflection point where they really executed on putting ML into the core of their platforms and then growing off of it. These systems are built so that as they get bigger, more data feeds into them, more clients come in and the system becomes more and more accurate. Our AXON engine is trying to predict what a consumer will download and engage with in the future, and it does it at exceptionally high accuracy, that every day we go forward, that accuracy improves. And really, when we executed on it, we were trying to execute on the vision of expanding our first-party data, which was speeding it and then unlocking the power of that data with the machine learning engine so as that first-party data continues to grow as well, that engine will only get better.  I would say, really, what inning are we in, it's 6 months in, so we think we're very early in it. Tying into Adjust, too, we're just -- we're thrilled to bring that team on. They have great products. But the reality is the strategic benefit for us with that deal that can unlock the most cash flow for us going forward was that to date, we haven't had a sales force. We haven't been selling our product to the marketplace. It's working exceptionally well. And as you look at the growth of both the third-party clients and the TSTV stat, growth rate is second to none in the marketplace, and our enterprise clients are still under 200. The market has over 10,000 potential enterprise clients, and we're excited about Adjust sales force coming in and really help us deliver on more clients into the system, which will continue to help it grow.  On the second question around M&A. Our pipeline is always robust because our approach is just different when it comes to the content side of M&A. We're working with our own clients to bring them into effectively our walled garden and help facilitate more growth off of their business that they've built. Almost every single one of our transactions in the past have been client first outside of banker-run processes early in their evolution, companies that we were able to acquire and then accelerate the growth thereof. And then we just announced in the release 2 deals that we executed on in April for 2 more early but top grossing games that we think we can go quite materially from here: one, West Game; And Two, a slots game that brings the first slots game into our portfolio. These 2 games are at a run rate of $200 million a year revenue, and we paid upfront $300 million for them within some contingent payments that will -- they'll be able to accumulate as they grow their businesses with our platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: I just have two questions as well. One, can you discuss the integration of Machine Zone so far and the learnings from operating in the mid-core space? and then with West Game, this does look like you're moving deeper into the space. I guess do you expect synergies you realize in casual can be applied to other genres like mid-core and casino?  And then my second question is just if you could maybe elaborate on the full year revenue guide of what your assumption is in that guide for organic growth.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Alexia. I'll take the first question, and I'll leave the guidance question over to Herald. On the first question, the Machine Zone transaction, we closed actually almost exactly a year ago. And really, integration for us with content studios is pretty straightforward. We want them to focus on creating, and then we want our platform to really be their accelerator of growth. And so it creates a perfect environment to unlock that creative talent that they've got.  The Machine Zone transaction for us was interesting for 2 reasons. One was they had a team that was very skilled at building these core games. The -- and we believe that they can unlock that value going forward with future games. But then more importantly, the reason it was interesting to us is they have the biggest pool of first-party data where consumers had transacted in their games, consumers that are interested in these male-centric strategy games, a really high-value segment for advertising. And our content strategy, really, the core reason we got into content was to be able to supply our advertising ecosystem, our platform and our software with first-party data. Machine Zone gave us scaled data second to none.  And with West Game, as far as synergies go, the reason we're excited about growing that game particularly is it's much earlier in its life cycle than Machine Zone games. And we've got the data to be able to execute on the machine learning to be able to grow that game through our platform. So we think we're going to be able to grow it quite a lot from where it is today, already one of the top 100 grossing games in the world. Herald, do you want to take the point around or the forecast?\nHerald Chen: Yes. That's great. Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance we've given for the full year, it really takes into consideration just the tremendous opportunities we're seeing across all of our assets. And you can see in our strong first quarter here where we had growth in each one of the businesses, and we also had very, very robust organic growth.  And so we see that continuing in our 2021 full year guidance where the majority of it will continue to be from organic measures as well as we will augment that with M&A. As you just mentioned, we just did 2 acquisitions that -- or run rate of about $200 million, which will be included in our guidance. But we still see opportunities for M&A on top of that. But in terms of guidance, our policy is really not to include any additional meaningful M&A, nor do we include any large, new hits from our studios, both of which are very hard to predict. We're certainly pursuing both those things, but notwithstanding, it's hard to project those 2 things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. First one on the software side. AXON has been a big success. Curious to hear about other areas where you see low-hanging fruit improvements to make to that product, to continue to competitively differentiate and win even more market share and just kind of get beyond the AXON lapping.  And then secondly, on the first-party consumer business, can you give us examples where are you using any machine learning on that side yet? Or is that sort of something you're still thinking about doing over time to improve the over algorithms on the consumer side?\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Brian, for the questions. On the first point, really, when it comes to machine learning, one, you have to have a data advantage to be able to execute on machine learning at this level. And we had the data advantage. We executed on getting the machine learning to market. We also had invested over the last decade in building our large-scale data infrastructure, which is a key component of machine learning.  Now where it is today, once you put these software programs out, there's a couple of areas where you get leverage to grow them. One is just getting more clients into our platform will continue to expand the business model. Two is the first-party data continuing to scale, giving us that exclusive data will continue to power that machine learning to become more accurate and allow us to get more growth in that business model. And then the third is, of course, we've got data scientists and machine learning engineers working on improving the algorithms all the time. Those three pieces are all really early stages. So we see a lot of upside in that technology.  And then you brought up taking market share. We don't look at the ecosystem as we're executing on AXON, and we're taking market share from peers. As you know, a couple of our direct peers have been in the public markets recently and just reported their first quarter earnings. We're all doing very well. The way this ecosystem works is when something like AXON happens, we're driving more value to our clients. And as our clients grow, and as our own studios grow, the TAM just grows with it. And all of the companies in the ecosystem have different models, different algorithms and different data, and all of us end up growing with that. And that's what makes this market so exciting.  On the other question around applying AXON or machine learning specifically to games, it's a great point. And frankly, we started our games business 3 years ago. We're really new into content. And the intent of that games business was to get first-party data at scale to power our advertising business. We've been busy building AXON and applying it to the advertising side, so we haven't had the time yet to go apply it to the game side of the business. We think that presents us an immense opportunity for growth as we go forward, and it's work that we're actively working on today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: You guys have been pretty consistent in your messaging about wanting to do M&A, and you've done some more today. But I guess my longer-term question is do you feel like it's mostly done on the ad tech side, and more of what you're going to do is more about buying apps or games. Is that the way to think about it? Or do you still think there are other pieces of the puzzle on the tech side?\nAdam Foroughi: I think the way we look at it is the content side is just natural. If we've got clients on the platform, whether they're gaming or they're nongaming and they've got content and they need a growth partner, then we can be acquisitive and really help facilitate their growth and facilitate our goal of accumulating more first-party data into our engine.  On the software side, it's much more opportunistic. If you look at every -- the 3 deals we've done on that side, MAX, SafeDK and Adjust, they were all to go acquire software that our studios used or our platform could utilize to expand the offering to the marketplace. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities that we think there are opportunities to be acquisitive to augment the offering that we've got in the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America.\nRyan Gee: Two, if I may. I think the consumer business is very strong, accelerating to over 3x year-over-year, well ahead of our expectations. I think the complacent investor might view that as just a gaming company benefiting from the pandemic. But is there a way that you can maybe tie in how the strength there is actually a direct reflection of the power of your platform to drive monetization and discovery for your first-party apps?  And then secondly, just on the outlook real quick. It seems like that was also well ahead of what we were expecting in absolute terms, but regarding the profit margin of the business, can you talk about the factors influencing the year-over-year trends there in margins? How much of this is evolving revenue mix versus incremental investments to grow software or grow apps?\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Ryan. I'll jump on the first, and I'll let Herald handle the second. On the first point, really, of course, we know the pandemic was beneficial for many gaming companies. But I think there's a little bit of a disconnect on the types of games that benefited. Our games are predominantly casual mobile games. If you look at some of the oldest titles in our library that we own, a game like Wordscapes, that game is played on the go. And when we have the pandemic hit, we're all sitting at home, we had plenty more time on our hands. Console gaming really benefited the most. And then the second benefit was to be deeply engaging metaverse-type games on mobile.  The casual games didn't see much of an uptick. If you look back at the growth of our content, you could see a direct correlation to when we launched AXON, and we gave you that TSTV stat, too. You can see the acceleration and the difference between the total TSTV and the third-party clients on our platform. That difference is us spending on our own platform to grow our apps.  Pre-AXON, frankly, we just weren't as successful at growing our own apps because we didn't have that software at the level of efficiency that it is today. Now, today, with that software running at the capacity it's running at, we're accelerating every part of our business. The content grows because we're able to grow the spend through our own platform and through other channels utilizing our software. And then that content and feedback data, which makes the software more accurate, and then the software grows the content. So we've really unlocked that flywheel effect that we highlighted in our S-1 only dating back 6 months ago, and that's what we're so excited about looking forward.\nHerald Chen: Ryan, thanks for the second question as well, which I'll address. Yes. Again, in terms of the guidance and the margin structure and how that progresses, we're confident in our top line growth rates across the board. As we mentioned, again, we show that in this quarter with 90% on software, 57% on business apps and 215% growth on consumer apps.  And so as we build out the year, we see each one of those businesses continuing to grow. And as we're able to grow and scale over our cost structure, our margins do expand. And so composition is important to follow as well, and certainly, in this first quarter, with Project Makeover, we had more, as you noted, more consumer app revenue, which did increase that side and also increased cost of goods sold on that piece of revenue.  So we see for our full year guidance, at 26% margin, we do see our software business accelerating relative to the other businesses, as you also saw in the first quarter and I think relative to most of your models that you published earlier this week. And so we're confident in the top line, just given all the aspects of the business that we're executing against and then having margins expand as we continue to scale over our cost structure as well as the mix of the business continues to accelerate on the software side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Guys, congrats on your inaugural earnings call. So two questions, if I may. First, for games you acquire, can you just speak to maybe a typical lift in growth to their revenues, how long until they peak? I realize it's probably early until most of the peak, but to those that may have had -- and what's kind of the decline curve for some of these maybe earlier games? That's a question that we've actually gotten from a number of investors earlier this week.  And then second, can you speak to the nongaming opportunity, especially now that you own Adjust? How quickly do you start moving in that direction? And Any verticals that excite you? Or I guess what are the verticals that excite you the most? If you can comment on that.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Youssef. On the acquisition side, we put in the S-1 data around the acquisitions that we had for over a year. But we are just so fresh in the strategy. So we haven't had a lot of time with a lot of the games in the portfolio. We typically, in the first 12 months, when we measure it on average, grow these businesses over 100% once they come on to the platform.  Now there's something interesting about our acquisition strategy is that we don't buy to sit on top of the EBITDA that they previously had. Most gaming companies don't operate in an aggressive marketing fashion because they're sensitive to generating cash flow. Our objective with the content business is not to generate cash flow or material cash flow from the content business yet. The objective from the Content business is to grow the games to as large as possible to get as much transactional data that we can get from the customers playing our games and use that data in a behavioral and privacy safe manner in our ad algorithm, which accelerates our business and has exceptionally high software margins.  And so we operate that way. We're going these games through their life cycle where when they're early, they can grow to a ceiling in revenue. Eventually, the cohorts that you're accumulating stack up on top of each other, and the games become cash flow businesses. So over time, as our game business continues to become bigger and bigger, we will get to a point where it will also become a high contributor of margin to the business. But right now, we're focused on growth, and we've been able to execute on that strategy across almost every single one of the acquisitions we've made.  On the second question, when it comes to nongaming, of course, exclusively, for most of the company's history, we've been focused on gaming companies. That's not because our technology was specifically geared towards gaming. It's also not because our data or machine learning is geared towards gaming. The data that we have in our business is built on top of this casual audience that we have across all of our games and then also that male-centric strategy player, which is a very high-value category of consumer for many advertisers outside gaming. But the nongaming businesses require companies to sell into them, to explain to them that there's an opportunity on our platform for them to go execute a growth strategy. To date, we've never had a sales force, and Adjust brings us 300 seasoned salespeople who know how to sell software in the ecosystem. They have over 3,000 clients, and 40% of those enterprise clients are nongaming companies. We're already executing on the strategy there of being able to bring nongaming companies onto our platform. It's the fastest-growing category of company that's coming on to the platform today.  And just to give you a sense of one case study of why we were really excited about the Adjust transaction and the potentially leveraged financial profile that we can build off of that sales force cross-selling our product against their clients, when we went and assessed that transaction, we did one case, to really build the case internally on why this is potentially so valuable. We took a health and fitness subscription app and took that, put it on our platform. The company is paying Adjust today $3,000 a month. They went live on our platform about 90 days ago, and they're now yielding us close to $500,000 a year or $40,000 a month. We're not to say that every one of Adjust's clients that amount to over $100 million a year SaaS business are going to convert at 13x revenue dollars to our platform, but we're very excited about the cross-sell opportunity, especially when it comes to nongaming.\nHerald Chen: Youssef, if I can go back to your question on the game side, you'd asked about just the decline rate. What we're finding with these casual games is -- once we get them launched, we do grow them. Once we own them, launch new games. They reach peaks. They do plateau at some level. But they do last for a very long period of time. You'll see in our letter for Q1, we show existing studios from Q1 of 2020 to Q1 of '21. Existing studios were able to grow at a 91% rate. And so even after a year, they continue to grow because of our software and because of our marketing expertise.  And so we're trying to build these cohorts. As Adam said, we're only 3 years into this. So we start layering these annual cohorts, and they start building up. The great thing behind that, too, is that the content business then starts to generate even higher margins because we're not going out and have to buy a lot of that revenue stream that's been already paid for. overall, the games business grew, for those 2, to 141%. So still the new pieces that we've added that we acquired added more growth but at 91% growth on existing games. We think those -- that type of layering will allow us to continue to compound growth on the content side.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Martin Yang [ph] with Oppenheimer & Company.\nUnidentified Analyst: My first question is on your acquisition targets. When you think about the content you're going to acquire and how that aligns with your first-party data strategy, do you intentionally pick out like the missing genres or trying to sell out the full spectrum of the most popular genres for mobile games?\nAdam Foroughi: Martin [ph], yes, that's a good point and a good catch. If you look at our acquisition strategy historically, we've targeted a whole bunch of different genres, and that wasn't by coincidence. Fundamentally, we want content that's appealing to every single one of the 400 million-plus daily active users we see on the platform so that we can build first-party data relationships with those consumers. And we've been able to execute on that strategy really efficiently.  We're at a point now where we've got content for everyone. And so now the strategy is just scaling that content. The bigger we get on the content side, the better our software gets. The better our software gets, the more growth we get on the content side. And so we're really excited about getting to this point where now we've got titles after the Slots transaction that we just announced across every single major genre in mobile gaming.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. So related to that question, do you apply the same strategy with maybe different geographies? Because in my understanding, some -- player behavior might differ a little bit in between different regions.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. That's for sure true. International is actually one of our big growth vectors. So far, the U.S. has made up a majority of our revenue. Tier 1 English-speaking markets is the focus. Japan is actually our second biggest market. And to your point, some games will overlap with the Japanese audience, but culturally, there are some games that are specific to it. And then China is a whole another vector that's just unique to itself, half the world's gaming audience an opportunity but contained within the country. We think these international expansion points present a big opportunity for growth in the future for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: One more question, if I may. Can you maybe comment on the user acquisition environment in the first quarter, whether you see anything unique or different than usual as most publishers are preparing for the IDFA impact?\nAdam Foroughi: We haven't seen any changing trends. If you look at our TSTV stat, you'll see a lot of our user acquisition does flow through our own platform. So that does make us a little bit unique in terms of having this perspective, but we do spend a lot on other channels as well. I would say the marketplace itself continues to expand in potential applications that can market on marketing platforms. And this is why we're really excited about potentially new clients and new categories on our software platform. Things like fintech have been exploding in competitiveness in ad auctions with crypto-based apps spending a lot of money. And these are just all new concepts to us in our software platform. We haven't gone out and sold these companies to buy with us yet, but we're actively executing on that strategy when it comes to our platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart with William Blair.\nRalph Schackart: On the Consumer business, which overall was much stronger than expected, in particular, at least relative to our model, you had a very strong MAP number. Just curious how much of that might have been driven by Project Makeover versus just the broader portfolio set of games performing well versus, perhaps, any improvements that you had in the software platform.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. So I can handle that. And then if Herald knows the exact split, he can give it to you. But for the most part, the way we look at our content portfolio is at any given time, the content that's newer, that's fresher is going to be what we're going to be able to accelerate the growth of. And Project Makeover launched in November. It accelerated to -- today, it's a top 15 grossing game. So certainly, it's feeding a whole bunch of consumers that are transacting back into our systems. But it launched in November, and that was 3 months after we launched AXON. And really, the growth in that game was facilitated from how well our software is performing, and it just fed back into the system.  So what we're really excited about is that you see that MAP number grow. The most important data that really drives the success of ad algorithms for any company is if you can accumulate scaled transactional data. When you understand what the consumer is interested in purchasing, you can give them much more relevant advertising. And when consumers purchase in Project Makeover, we're able to take that MAP data, anonymize it and use that behavioral signal back in our ad algorithm, and that facilitates expansion in everything. And that's why you're seeing our business growing so quickly in Q1.\nHerald Chen: Ralph, it's Herald. Yes, Certainly, Product Makeover had a big impact in our first quarter in consumer revenue. But even when excluding Project Makeover from consumer in the quarter, we still grew it at a very, very high rate. So almost a triple-digit -- maybe actually to slightly over triple-digit rate on everything else. And that's really due to the fact, what Adam is referring to, the overall platform also improved, right, at the same time, with the launch of AXON underlying a lot of our own marketing spend. And we increased our percentage of our own spending on our platform. Instead, that improves the consumer base overall, but certainly nice to have Project Makeover included to get to that 200%- plus growth rate.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nAdam Foroughi: We just wanted to thank everyone for spending time with us and really getting to know our business, and we'll look forward to talking to you all more on callbacks and at next quarter's earnings call. We are thrilled with where our business is at. We don't know of many other companies in this environment that are growing revenue and EBITDA triple digits this Q1 versus last year's Q1. We're executing on all cylinders, and we see a road map to growth for many years to come, and we're excited for you all to learn more about our business as we go forward.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today for our first public company earnings call. I want to begin by thanking our amazing teammates around the world who continue to push relentlessly to execute on our vision. Of course, we wouldn't be here without our partners who trust us as an integral part of their growth and monetization strategy. And thank you for the support from our new investors. We are very much focused on the long term and appreciate that you recognize our competitive advantages and long-term opportunities. We are looking forward to sharing details about AppLovin's first quarter results.  While I don't want to steal Herald's thunder by covering financial metrics, I do want to say that we are very proud of our record first quarter, growing revenue and EBITDA over 100% year-over-year. I also want to highlight the 3 primary objectives that we focus on in driving long-term growth. We review each objective in detail in our shareholder letter on the website, but I want to touch on each at a high level here.  First, we're a marketing software company that helps mobile app developers attract new users and grow their businesses. Our most important objective is to focus on growing our software platform, and our key business decisions always link back to this objective. We accelerated to 90% growth year-over-year in Q1 in our Business Software segment. Unlike many tech companies, the pandemic had negligible impact on our business since our audiences play casual games on the go. Our growth in the last 2 quarters was primarily driven by technological improvements from our machine learning engine, AXON, which we launched late in 2020 and continues to improve dramatically. These improvements helped us significantly grow our customer base and average revenue per customer.  We're also excited about closing the Adjust acquisition in April. The acquisition provides us access to their leading attribution analytics products, over 2,000 potential clients and a sales force for the first time in our company's history. With these new Adjust assets under AppLovin, we are excited to grow both their solutions and our AXON-powered software.  Our second objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of apps to generate more first-party data for AXON. Since 2018, we built a high-growth, diversified portfolio. Our combined business apps and consumer apps include over 200 games and nearly 40 million daily active users. We work with 15 studios around the globe that have a workforce of approximately 2,000 game creators.  Today, our apps are some of the world's most popular mobile games, including Project Makeover, Wordscapes, Matchington Mansion, Clockmaker, Bingo Story, Final Fantasy 15 and many others. We're able to grow these games because of our seasoned team, accretive M&A and, most importantly, our marketing expertise and cost synergies we get from marketing our apps on our software platform.  Our scaled first-party data advantage feeds our software engine and also insulates our business model from privacy changes relative to peers. We've already seen over 10% of iOS users update to iOS 14.5 or later, and within that audience, we're not seeing any material impact to our business.  Our third business objective as a platform business with high margins is to create shareholder value through long-term growth and increasing cash flows. We believe predictable growth and cash flow is the ultimate determinant of shareholder value. The combination of our machine learning software, our first-party data advantage and our massive TAM gives us confidence in our long-term annual cash flow growth target of over 30%.  We've made great progress in Q1 but believe we're just getting started. At AppLovin, we built market-leading tools that help our customers grow their businesses. We recently put all the pieces together in our business model that has evolved over a decade of investment. As you evaluate our results, we believe you will see the strength of our platform and why we're excited about our path of growth for years to come.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Herald. Thanks, Stephen, for the questions. And taking the first one. Really, ML, if you look at the success of all the biggest companies in the world today, whether it's Google or Facebook, you can tie their success over years back to the inflection point where they really executed on putting ML into the core of their platforms and then growing off of it. These systems are built so that as they get bigger, more data feeds into them, more clients come in and the system becomes more and more accurate. Our AXON engine is trying to predict what a consumer will download and engage with in the future, and it does it at exceptionally high accuracy, that every day we go forward, that accuracy improves. And really, when we executed on it, we were trying to execute on the vision of expanding our first-party data, which was speeding it and then unlocking the power of that data with the machine learning engine so as that first-party data continues to grow as well, that engine will only get better.  I would say, really, what inning are we in, it's 6 months in, so we think we're very early in it. Tying into Adjust, too, we're just -- we're thrilled to bring that team on. They have great products. But the reality is the strategic benefit for us with that deal that can unlock the most cash flow for us going forward was that to date, we haven't had a sales force. We haven't been selling our product to the marketplace. It's working exceptionally well. And as you look at the growth of both the third-party clients and the TSTV stat, growth rate is second to none in the marketplace, and our enterprise clients are still under 200. The market has over 10,000 potential enterprise clients, and we're excited about Adjust sales force coming in and really help us deliver on more clients into the system, which will continue to help it grow.  On the second question around M&A. Our pipeline is always robust because our approach is just different when it comes to the content side of M&A. We're working with our own clients to bring them into effectively our walled garden and help facilitate more growth off of their business that they've built. Almost every single one of our transactions in the past have been client first outside of banker-run processes early in their evolution, companies that we were able to acquire and then accelerate the growth thereof. And then we just announced in the release 2 deals that we executed on in April for 2 more early but top grossing games that we think we can go quite materially from here: one, West Game; And Two, a slots game that brings the first slots game into our portfolio. These 2 games are at a run rate of $200 million a year revenue, and we paid upfront $300 million for them within some contingent payments that will -- they'll be able to accumulate as they grow their businesses with our platform. Thanks, Alexia. I'll take the first question, and I'll leave the guidance question over to Herald. On the first question, the Machine Zone transaction, we closed actually almost exactly a year ago. And really, integration for us with content studios is pretty straightforward. We want them to focus on creating, and then we want our platform to really be their accelerator of growth. And so it creates a perfect environment to unlock that creative talent that they've got.  The Machine Zone transaction for us was interesting for 2 reasons. One was they had a team that was very skilled at building these core games. The -- and we believe that they can unlock that value going forward with future games. But then more importantly, the reason it was interesting to us is they have the biggest pool of first-party data where consumers had transacted in their games, consumers that are interested in these male-centric strategy games, a really high-value segment for advertising. And our content strategy, really, the core reason we got into content was to be able to supply our advertising ecosystem, our platform and our software with first-party data. Machine Zone gave us scaled data second to none.  And with West Game, as far as synergies go, the reason we're excited about growing that game particularly is it's much earlier in its life cycle than Machine Zone games. And we've got the data to be able to execute on the machine learning to be able to grow that game through our platform. So we think we're going to be able to grow it quite a lot from where it is today, already one of the top 100 grossing games in the world. Herald, do you want to take the point around or the forecast? Thanks, Brian, for the questions. On the first point, really, when it comes to machine learning, one, you have to have a data advantage to be able to execute on machine learning at this level. And we had the data advantage. We executed on getting the machine learning to market. We also had invested over the last decade in building our large-scale data infrastructure, which is a key component of machine learning.  Now where it is today, once you put these software programs out, there's a couple of areas where you get leverage to grow them. One is just getting more clients into our platform will continue to expand the business model. Two is the first-party data continuing to scale, giving us that exclusive data will continue to power that machine learning to become more accurate and allow us to get more growth in that business model. And then the third is, of course, we've got data scientists and machine learning engineers working on improving the algorithms all the time. Those three pieces are all really early stages. So we see a lot of upside in that technology.  And then you brought up taking market share. We don't look at the ecosystem as we're executing on AXON, and we're taking market share from peers. As you know, a couple of our direct peers have been in the public markets recently and just reported their first quarter earnings. We're all doing very well. The way this ecosystem works is when something like AXON happens, we're driving more value to our clients. And as our clients grow, and as our own studios grow, the TAM just grows with it. And all of the companies in the ecosystem have different models, different algorithms and different data, and all of us end up growing with that. And that's what makes this market so exciting.  On the other question around applying AXON or machine learning specifically to games, it's a great point. And frankly, we started our games business 3 years ago. We're really new into content. And the intent of that games business was to get first-party data at scale to power our advertising business. We've been busy building AXON and applying it to the advertising side, so we haven't had the time yet to go apply it to the game side of the business. We think that presents us an immense opportunity for growth as we go forward, and it's work that we're actively working on today. I think the way we look at it is the content side is just natural. If we've got clients on the platform, whether they're gaming or they're nongaming and they've got content and they need a growth partner, then we can be acquisitive and really help facilitate their growth and facilitate our goal of accumulating more first-party data into our engine.  On the software side, it's much more opportunistic. If you look at every -- the 3 deals we've done on that side, MAX, SafeDK and Adjust, they were all to go acquire software that our studios used or our platform could utilize to expand the offering to the marketplace. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities that we think there are opportunities to be acquisitive to augment the offering that we've got in the market. Thanks, Ryan. I'll jump on the first, and I'll let Herald handle the second. On the first point, really, of course, we know the pandemic was beneficial for many gaming companies. But I think there's a little bit of a disconnect on the types of games that benefited. Our games are predominantly casual mobile games. If you look at some of the oldest titles in our library that we own, a game like Wordscapes, that game is played on the go. And when we have the pandemic hit, we're all sitting at home, we had plenty more time on our hands. Console gaming really benefited the most. And then the second benefit was to be deeply engaging metaverse-type games on mobile.  The casual games didn't see much of an uptick. If you look back at the growth of our content, you could see a direct correlation to when we launched AXON, and we gave you that TSTV stat, too. You can see the acceleration and the difference between the total TSTV and the third-party clients on our platform. That difference is us spending on our own platform to grow our apps.  Pre-AXON, frankly, we just weren't as successful at growing our own apps because we didn't have that software at the level of efficiency that it is today. Now, today, with that software running at the capacity it's running at, we're accelerating every part of our business. The content grows because we're able to grow the spend through our own platform and through other channels utilizing our software. And then that content and feedback data, which makes the software more accurate, and then the software grows the content. So we've really unlocked that flywheel effect that we highlighted in our S-1 only dating back 6 months ago, and that's what we're so excited about looking forward. Thanks, Youssef. On the acquisition side, we put in the S-1 data around the acquisitions that we had for over a year. But we are just so fresh in the strategy. So we haven't had a lot of time with a lot of the games in the portfolio. We typically, in the first 12 months, when we measure it on average, grow these businesses over 100% once they come on to the platform.  Now there's something interesting about our acquisition strategy is that we don't buy to sit on top of the EBITDA that they previously had.

We haven't gone out and sold these companies to buy with us yet, but we're actively executing on that strategy when it comes to our platform. Yes. So I can handle that. And then if Herald knows the exact split, he can give it to you. But for the most part, the way we look at our content portfolio is at any given time, the content that's newer, that's fresher is going to be what we're going to be able to accelerate the growth of. And Project Makeover launched in November. It accelerated to -- today, it's a top 15 grossing game. So certainly, it's feeding a whole bunch of consumers that are transacting back into our systems. But it launched in November, and that was 3 months after we launched AXON. And really, the growth in that game was facilitated from how well our software is performing, and it just fed back into the system.  So what we're really excited about is that you see that MAP number grow. The most important data that really drives the success of ad algorithms for any company is if you can accumulate scaled transactional data. When you understand what the consumer is interested in purchasing, you can give them much more relevant advertising. And when consumers purchase in Project Makeover, we're able to take that MAP data, anonymize it and use that behavioral signal back in our ad algorithm, and that facilitates expansion in everything. And that's why you're seeing our business growing so quickly in Q1. We just wanted to thank everyone for spending time with us and really getting to know our business, and we'll look forward to talking to you all more on callbacks and at next quarter's earnings call. We are thrilled with where our business is at. We don't know of many other companies in this environment that are growing revenue and EBITDA triple digits this Q1 versus last year's Q1. We're executing on all cylinders, and we see a road map to growth for many years to come, and we're excited for you all to learn more about our business as we go forward."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us. As Adam mentioned, we appreciate that our business model is a bit nuanced. What we hope through this call, our shareholder letter, our first quarter results, our guidance and our financial performance over time is that you come to appreciate that our integrated model is the reason for our strong Q1 and for our confidence in our long-term growth prospects.  Before we get to your questions, I want to briefly highlight a few topics. We did have a very strong first quarter with 132% and 110% year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth, respectively. For those wanting to understand our mix of organic versus inorganic growth, our organic growth was a robust 89%.  Next, I want to discuss our software business, which falls under our business revenue. We wanted to provide you additional metrics regarding just our software business to help you understand the scale and growth drivers of that business.  The first is total software transaction value, a new metric for us. It measures and helps dimensionalize the scale of our software business. Our software is used by our first-party apps and third-party clients. However, we can't report our own spend on our own software under GAAP rules. So we measure TSTV, or total software transaction value, as the total net value transacted from all clients as if our own studios were stand-alone businesses. In Q1, this TST measure increased by 155% year-over-year to $148 million to nearly a $600 million run rate. That illustrates both the scale and rapid growth of our software platforms.  The second new metric is software platform enterprise clients. While we already report business enterprise clients' APIs on an annual basis, we think it would be helpful for investors to have price times quantity metrics for just the software business on a quarterly basis. Specs is the number of third-party software clients who, in a quarter, spend an annualized run rate revenue of over $125,000. We had 193 specs in the first quarter versus 130 in the first quarter of 2020, a 48% year-over-year increase with the average value per customer rising 32%. We grew both price and quantity primarily because of the improvements in AXON, which, in turn, increased the efficacy of our software.  On the content side, I'd summarize that we do have many structural and financial advantages on marketing spend, which simply lets us invest more in effective user acquisition spend than the market. Since in the mobile app market marketing dollars drives mobile app growth, we were able to rapidly grow our apps.  With respect to Adam's comment regarding long-term cash flow growth, we believe our strong rule-out performance ultimately will translate into long-term cash flow growth. We are targeting at 30-plus percent. In the letter, we have provided you with descriptions of our operating cost structures so you're better able to appreciate our ability to grow cash flows over time, in particular, as our software business continues to expand.  Turning to guidance. For full year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 85% to between $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion. For the full year 2021, we are guiding to adjusted EBITDA in the range of $680 million to $700 million, representing a doubling from the prior year. Our policy will be to provide you with fiscal year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA updating it quarterly.  With that, we're happy to answer your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. That's great. Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance we've given for the full year, it really takes into consideration just the tremendous opportunities we're seeing across all of our assets. And you can see in our strong first quarter here where we had growth in each one of the businesses, and we also had very, very robust organic growth.  And so we see that continuing in our 2021 full year guidance where the majority of it will continue to be from organic measures as well as we will augment that with M&A. As you just mentioned, we just did 2 acquisitions that -- or run rate of about $200 million, which will be included in our guidance. But we still see opportunities for M&A on top of that. But in terms of guidance, our policy is really not to include any additional meaningful M&A, nor do we include any large, new hits from our studios, both of which are very hard to predict. We're certainly pursuing both those things, but notwithstanding, it's hard to project those 2 things. Ryan, thanks for the second question as well, which I'll address. Yes. Again, in terms of the guidance and the margin structure and how that progresses, we're confident in our top line growth rates across the board. As we mentioned, again, we show that in this quarter with 90% on software, 57% on business apps and 215% growth on consumer apps.  And so as we build out the year, we see each one of those businesses continuing to grow. And as we're able to grow and scale over our cost structure, our margins do expand. And so composition is important to follow as well, and certainly, in this first quarter, with Project Makeover, we had more, as you noted, more consumer app revenue, which did increase that side and also increased cost of goods sold on that piece of revenue.  So we see for our full year guidance, at 26% margin, we do see our software business accelerating relative to the other businesses, as you also saw in the first quarter and I think relative to most of your models that you published earlier this week. And so we're confident in the top line, just given all the aspects of the business that we're executing against and then having margins expand as we continue to scale over our cost structure as well as the mix of the business continues to accelerate on the software side. Youssef, if I can go back to your question on the game side, you'd asked about just the decline rate. What we're finding with these casual games is -- once we get them launched, we do grow them. Once we own them, launch new games. They reach peaks. They do plateau at some level. But they do last for a very long period of time. You'll see in our letter for Q1, we show existing studios from Q1 of 2020 to Q1 of '21. Existing studios were able to grow at a 91% rate. And so even after a year, they continue to grow because of our software and because of our marketing expertise.  And so we're trying to build these cohorts. As Adam said, we're only 3 years into this. So we start layering these annual cohorts, and they start building up. The great thing behind that, too, is that the content business then starts to generate even higher margins because we're not going out and have to buy a lot of that revenue stream that's been already paid for. overall, the games business grew, for those 2, to 141%. So still the new pieces that we've added that we acquired added more growth but at 91% growth on existing games. We think those -- that type of layering will allow us to continue to compound growth on the content side. Ralph, it's Herald. Yes, Certainly, Product Makeover had a big impact in our first quarter in consumer revenue. But even when excluding Project Makeover from consumer in the quarter, we still grew it at a very, very high rate. So almost a triple-digit -- maybe actually to slightly over triple-digit rate on everything else. And that's really due to the fact, what Adam is referring to, the overall platform also improved, right, at the same time, with the launch of AXON underlying a lot of our own marketing spend. And we increased our percentage of our own spending on our platform. Instead, that improves the consumer base overall, but certainly nice to have Project Makeover included to get to that 200%- plus growth rate."

We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022, and in our Form 10-Q for the third quarter, which we expect to file later this week. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter available on our Investor Relations website. Please be sure to review the GAAP measures and the reconciliations as the non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. Be advised this conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our IR website. I'd now like to turn it over to Adam for some opening remarks, then we'll open it up for Q&A. Please go ahead, Adam.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks all for joining us today. As this market continues to be difficult, it's easy to get disappointed, but you're not going to hear any disappointment from me today. I've been building businesses for nearly two decades now. And one thing I know is it takes years, not quarters to build the great business. We have several things to be excited about at AppLovin today. First, in '22, we're going to generate over $1 billion of EBITDA, growing nearly 50% over '21. We're going to convert a majority of this to cash. Our ability to generate so much cash allows us to patiently address our market and go after the business opportunities in front of us even in a difficult market. Second, our business is incredibly stable. It's easy to look at our industry and realize how difficult it is right now, but it's really easy also to forget how big a sector we're in. Everyone's got a mobile device. Most people are playing mobile games. Many people are playing mobile games every single day. The size and stability of our category as well as our market-leading technologies give us a lot of confidence in our business long-term. So what are we focused on at AppLovin today that gives us a lot of confidence that as we go through this economic downturn and come out, we're going to be a stronger business for it? First and most importantly, we're focused on retaining our core team. Many of our key contributors have been at the company for many years. I've had the pleasure of working with each and every one of you. We're going to continue to invest at AppLovin to make it a great place to work at. Second, we're really focused on attracting new talent. Over the last decade, there's been a talent crunch in Silicon Valley. More recently, we're getting resumes from incredibly qualified individuals better than we've ever seen before. The opportunity to attract new talent and pair with our existing and exceptional team gets us very excited. Third, we're working tirelessly to improve our core technologies. We see a path to doing so. And if we're successful, it will allow us to create growth that we can control. Fourth, we're still investing in new initiatives, and we're very excited about these. They utilize our core technologies and core competencies and will enable us to go into bigger market opportunities. If we're successful here, we'll create immense upside for both our shareholders and team. And lastly, we'll continue to be strategic with our cash. We'll look at share buybacks. We'll also use this moment in time to try to attract new investors, shareholders that are going to be focused on our long-term vision, just as we are. The market today presents a low multiple entry point into our company. What's interesting about that is we generate a ton of cash, so it gives us a good base, and we're also going after very, very big opportunities. If we're successful in executing around our vision over the coming years, we're going to create outsized returns, private market like returns. That opportunity gets us really excited. In fact, we're working harder today at AppLovin than we've ever worked before because of that upside. I'll now hand you off to Herald.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam. And as we outlined in our shareholder letter, given the challenging backdrop, we are very much focused on what we control. Firstly, bolstering our leadership positions in our core markets and our core products; and second, using this cash flow that Adam mentioned, to really invest behind initiatives that are focused on increasing the durability of our business, ultimately leading to long-term growth, which will then lead to enterprise value creation. Shifting to the third quarter. Starting with the software business, we grew that 59% year-over-year. And based on our guidance from the second quarter, as expected, it was generally flat to the third quarter. EBITDA grew 49% year-over-year and achieved a 62% margin in the third quarter. We had 538 SPECs, a record in the quarter, and that also had an NDRR, net dollar retention -- revenue retention of 166%. On the App side, which is a midstream or change, operational changes as we previously discussed, the revenue was down 24% year-over-year, but EBITDA, which is where we're focused, was up -- what was up 12% to a 17% margin. So on a combined basis, the total revenue was down slightly year-over-year, but EBITDA was up 35% to $258 million, $1 billion run rate and achieved an EBITDA margin of 36%. Then shifting to our outlook for Q4. We see Q4 coming in fairly similarly to what we achieved in Q3. And if that's the case, then the year, we'll end up at $2.8 billion with a margin structure around 37% to 38% adjusted EBITDA. The component to that we see would be software being over $1 billion in revenue with a mid-60s EBITDA margin. And on the application side, we would see a $1.7-plus billion revenue stream with a margin structure in the mid-teens. Of note, going forward, we will only be providing our forward quarter guidance and will not be providing a full-year guidance in the future. Then talking about cash flow in a little more detail. We do plan on generating $1 billion of EBITDA this year. We also plan on finishing the year with over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And as you all know, we're able to convert a high percentage of the EBITDA to free cash flow, given our very limited amount of CapEx. And as Adam described, we're able to then reinvest those dollars and have the financial flexibility and the patience to invest in projects, not trying to chase quarter-to-quarter growth on things that don't yield long-term return, but really invest behind our team, our talent and our tech to ensure that we're in a great spot going forward. We also have $400 million of availability -- over $400 million of availability on our stock repurchase plan. And given the stock market environment today and the rerating of risk as well as our highly leverageable operating structure, where if we do have growth in our high margin, high cash flow business, we think the combination of today's stock valuations and stock multiples, combined with the ability to have high operating levers when we return to growth, those dollars fall into the bottom line. We think for shareholders and for us in considering stock buybacks could be a very attractive return. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ryan to go through Q&A. Thank you.\nA - Ryan Gee: Thanks, Herald. So we'll now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] So the first question that we're going to take is from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Go ahead, Tim.\nTim Nollen: Great, can you guys hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: All good, thanks, Tim.\nTim Nollen: Excellent, thanks. Could I dig in a little bit to the software platform side, please? You've said previously that given the integration of MoPub and the great scale you've got there, all the integrations we've got on the mediation platform, that game makers will simply have to continue advertising to promote use of their games and you've got such a great market position there. It does, however, look like the growth is slowing. Just wondering if you could maybe update us on your thought process as to how game developers are going about their advertising or where they are pulling? And is there any increased risk from some of these being small game developers and therefore, in a financial crunch like this, high interest rates maybe they're running into some sort of near-term funding problems of their own, and that might lead to them pulling back on spending. Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Tim. So a couple of things packed in there that I'm going to address. First, we're on our mediation platform and also AppDiscovery platform, we're market leaders. The MAX platform, that's our mediation solution probably has the vast majority of all the ad inventory in the gaming sector running through it. Now what's interesting about that is it gives us access to a diverse set of advertisers where we're not dependent on any individual one. And most companies this year have been going through their P&L and really cutting costs. So marketing and OpEx, so most companies are at a stable point now where you're seeing the gaming market not growing because of that because of the focus on cash flow but you've also had that happen. And because we've got a lot of diversity and because the sector is so big and consumers are still engaging with mobile games as much as they've ever engaged before. And the biggest change was just this handicap of shift from growth investment to cash flow, and that's already been baked in. That gives us a lot of confidence in the stability of our business that I referenced in my comments a couple of minutes ago.\nRyan Gee: Tim, did you have any follow-ups?\nTim Nollen: No, I'll jump back in queue, let some others go in. Thanks.\nRyan Gee: Okay. We'll next go to Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Youssef, go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Hi guys, can you hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, we can.\nYoussef Squali: Excellent, thank you. So I guess just as a follow-up to the comments about the stability in the business, Adam, I know you guys are not guiding, obviously, to 2023. But how are you guys thinking about the puts and takes as you go through your own budgeting process, do you think at a base level that 2023 is a growth year or not. And then revenues from non-specs was down 34%. Maybe can you just unpack that for us a little bit what drove that?\nAdam Foroughi: So I'll touch on the first point, and then we can come back to revenue from non-spec because frankly, I think that's just a very small percentage of our numbers. So it's going to be a volatile metric that doesn't, frankly, matter a whole lot. When you think about the business as it is, again, we're very strong in the market. We have very consistent business. So there's no share loss anywhere in our core technologies. They work really well for the mobile game developer. And the one thing that we can't control that gives us hesitation on having long-term guidance right now is this focus of cash flow amongst our advertiser base and frankly, any company in technology today and away from growth. That's been baked into a lot of businesses at this point. Most managers are savvy enough to now have made the changes there. We just don't know when that reverses out. When the economy is going to turn around, when there will be a shift back to growth and sort of when you get to the bottom of this economic downturn. What we do know and that gives us confidence is we're already there and the business is very stable. We also know that our core technology has a lot of room to improve. That was another thing I touched on is that we're working really hard to improve it. And really, we have two paths to grow. One is advertisers are willing to invest more into growth and cash flow. So they're going to lower their goals and invest more dollars into our platform. The other is entirely in our control. It's improving the efficacy of our solution so that we're able to take the dollar spent. And even at a tighter set of goals, drive more scale to our advertising partners. We see a path to doing that, and that's what we're working on today. Both of those things give us a lot of confidence that we're going to have a strong baseline where we are in terms of the cash that we're able to generate, and we have room to grow as well that both has one factor outside of our control and one factor entirely within our control.\nYoussef Squali: Okay. But at a high level, though, no comment whether 2023 is a growth year for you guys or not. I guess you're saying it really depends on the overall macro environment?\nAdam Foroughi: And our overall ability to improve our core technologies.\nYoussef Squali: Right. On the non-SPEC, the reason I was asking is to try to get a sense of whether you're seeing more of the weakness among the smaller kind of software platform clients were among the enterprise because the non-SPECs would tend to be the smaller ones, correct?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Honestly, we don't actually look at each individual business. None of these partners make up a big part of our business. It's just as a whole, we all know that every company is under a lot of pressure right now to cut costs. So there has been just cost-cutting and budgetary constraints across the advertising sector. That's impacted most businesses, whether small or big.\nYoussef Squali: Got it, thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Youssef. We'll next go to Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs. Eric, go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Hope you can hear me okay. Maybe two, if I can. First, on the software platform. Intrigued by the comment you made in the letter about continuing to invest for the long term against potential new use cases. Away from the dynamic you find yourself in the market today, maybe sketch out a little bit about what you're sort of investing against for the longer-term and how you see the software platform continuing to evolve. That would be number one. And then number two, turning to the Apps business. Felt like based on the letter, there was a fair bit of puts and takes in the quarter, the relevance of selling nonstrategic assets, some investment being redirected in different elements. Can you talk a little bit about some of the headwinds and tailwinds just historically, that business faced as a result of those decisions in Q3 that impacted the absolute dollar amount we saw? Thanks so much.\nAdam Foroughi: I'll take the first question, Eric, and Herald will jump on the second. When it comes to our core business, we're pretty large scale at this point. We've talked about processing billions of dollars a year of advertising budget, and we're netting quite a bit, well over $1 billion a year of software revenue. And so at that level of scale, we built very good core technologies there. We also touched on a couple of letters ago about some investments in new initiatives. These have option value in our business. Frankly, like I said, I've been building businesses over a couple of decades. It takes years to be able to build the business to make an impact on a business as large scale as ours. But what gives us confidence going after these is they use the same core technologies and core competencies as our main business. One of those is extending our advertising solution to CTV. We did an acquisition there with a team role that we're very excited about. They have core technologies that are differentiated. And as we get our ad technologies to be sophisticated enough to extend to CTV, which is a work in progress, there'll be a go-to-market there, too, and the two technologies will couple together. Initiatives like that, we're not baking into any of our forward outlook or a thought process around the short term in the business, but we think long-term will create immense shareholder value and value for our team.\nHerald Chen: Eric, on the app side, I think we're making very good progress against our initiatives to get our portfolio to the position we want to get in terms of both the margin and then in a position for growth. So I'd say, really, there's three things that have taken place there. One, was instead of just driving users to gain the data, we really cut back on the UA to make sure that we are driving strong ROAS. And as we know in this marketplace, ROAS is even more difficult to come by. And so we've managed that UA spend. So we're taking revenue hit in exchange for profitability. And then the second lever is just going through the portfolio and saying, well, which ones actually have the ability to drive real enterprise value for us in the long-term. And there's some that frankly need more investment and more team, and there's others that really won't get there. And so we're in the process of winning through that, some of the studios we've just shut down or sold back to the Founder. We're renegotiating some of the earnouts. And again, others were actually investing in quite a few new games. So the third lever will then be ultimately when we get to portfolio that we want to own and grow forward. We think that will be a healthy portfolio. We hope to get there really by the end of this year is what we talked about. And then from there, it really depends if the market recovers in terms of valuations on whether or not we'd actually be able to monetize any significant portion of the portfolio. We may end up owning all of it, or with the right bid, we may end up selling all of it. But given the macroeconomic environment and where purchase multiples might be out there, our focus is very much on owning those assets for now, optimizing them and then figuring out what value creation could be had down the road. And it is a significant amount of value relative to our current enterprise value and would be very accretive and deleveraging to us, we think, with the right price for the right assets.\nRyan Gee: Were there any other follow-ups for you, Eric?\nEric Sheridan: All good, thank you.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thanks, Eric. We'll next go to Clark Lampen at BTIG. Clark, go ahead.\nClark Lampen: Hi guys, good evening. I've got two. Adam, you talked a couple of times about improving your own core technologies, and you alluded to that a couple of times sort of intra-quarter back in August and September. I wanted to see if maybe you could give us just a small window into sort of what you're working on, how that's progressing and sort of what's in focus. And then on diversification and appreciating that you guys are operating this business with more of a long-term mindset right now. And I think, as you said, like a private entity, are you comfortable investing more to help scale and drive growth for businesses like Wurl or perhaps also Array or Vessel next year. And maybe along those lines, has Apple's change around in-App NFT utility change the priority in terms of which of those new businesses, you do want to focus a little bit more on scaling and growing. Thanks a lot.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Clark. I'll go the second first and then back to the first question. We're focused on investing in new initiatives but we know how to build businesses with a cash flow mindset from the very beginning. As a company at AppLovin, we were profitable our second month in operation. And every one of these new initiatives, we take that same approach into. We're excited about the opportunity. We leverage a lot of the resources that we already have in place and the incremental investments that we're making into them are not material given the market opportunity that they present us. We'll continue to approach any business opportunity that way. We think of them as startups and the GMs that we have running those businesses also think of them as the CEO of a start-up. And when you have a new business that you're trying to incubate and build, a lot of times, you want to do it organically, make sure the product market fit is there, not overinvest early, and then we will invest behind growth as we know that we have something that's hot. And at that point in time, we'll talk about these businesses because in theory, they'll be making an impact to our numbers, both revenue and cost. And on the first question, when it comes to core technology, we always measure the error rate in our predictive engine. The whole model is predicated on being able to predict what are users going to download and engage with next and driving value to our advertisers. Value comes from revenue. So we've got to be very, very good at predicting a future event. And we know that there's error in our system. There's a lot of incremental changes that we, as a technology company, will do at all times. But very rarely, we'll go and rebuild a lot of our core system. We're doing both right now. And the last time we rebuilt a lot of our core systems to try to get an upgrade was actually the initial release of AXON, which was now, I think, about two years ago and obviously facilitated a ton of growth in our business. We're very excited about the potential of all of our investments in technology into our future.\nClark Lampen: That's really helpful. And if I could, maybe, Herald, just as a quick follow-up, you have north of $400 million in authorization for your buyback right now. I know that you have a lot of sort of attractive capital allocation opportunities in front of you. How does the sort of stock buyback option fit into the overall priority set right now?\nHerald Chen: Yes, thanks, Clark. Look, it is a high priority for us to allocate our capital wisely, particularly when there's opportunities that arise. And in this market, maybe it's around stock, maybe there's other assets that have gotten a lot cheaper than we'd want to own or it's just hiring a lot of great people that we didn't have access to before. And so we're taking advantage of this time in making lemonade out of these lemons, and we're glad to have the EBITDA that we do and the cash balance sheet that we have. But certainly, at these stock prices and given all the upside opportunities we see in the free cash flow characteristics and just the cash-on-cash yield that we project out, we certainly are considering stock buyback and we think the sizing of $400 million. We'll have to figure out what's the right amount to use at what period of time.\nClark Lampen: Thanks guys.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thanks, Clark. We'll next go to Matt Cost at Morgan Stanley. Matt, go ahead.\nMatthew Cost: Hey, can you hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, we can.\nMatthew Cost: Great. Hey Adam. Hi Herald. So it seems like the overall app install ad market has been decelerating over the course of 2022, but has not reached the level that we've seen mobile gaming and consumer spending on mobile gaming reach where you've got market year-on-year decline. So is it a fair statement that maybe the ad business here is a lagging indicator to what consumers are spending on mobile games? And does that create maybe more risk for next year, which you're reacting to? That's question one. Question two is, are there any indications or data points that you'll be looking for? I know you can't predict the future, but that you will be looking for to try to assess when the market has bottomed and maybe you'll be looking for opportunities to push harder on investment at that point?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. So I'll take the second first again, just top of mind. Look, we're investing in our business as it is. We run a high margin business, because we've got a lean team, but we've got an exceptional team that creates a lot of output. We've been run entrepreneurial since the get-go. So there's no shortage of investment against things that we see as opportunities. We've got new initiatives that we're investing into. We've got a technological rerate that we're investing into. And we're organizing a lot of the acquisitions that we've made over the last couple of years to be more advantageous for our business going forward. So we've not stopped investing and we'll continue to invest both in growth opportunities that we see in front of us right now and those that we come up with in the future. Nothing about the market is going to change that because we do generate enough cash to be opportunistic enough to be able to invest in things that we deem worthwhile even in today's market. Now when it comes to the market itself, mobile gaming has been declining. People are still consuming the same amount of mobile games, though. The big change, there's been two changes. One is, as we've talked about macroeconomic, where a lot of companies are focused on cash flow and away from revenue growth. That's just a requirement. That's already baked into the advertising ecosystem. The other changes that came obviously in our sector right around the same time as the economy fell off is that IDFA change. And traditionally, mobile gaming companies were able to spend a lot of their revenue back in the user acquisition, namely on some big social properties to be able to grow. Those buys had the best return on ad spend. They were highly targeted, and they were able to use those profits to subsidize future growth. Take that away, and you have two things that really hit the category. And both those happen at the same time. So you can't really decouple them. Both are also baked into the business. Our business, we're fortunate enough to have a massive penetration in the market we operate in. Our mediation product is market leading and our AppDiscovery product is market leading. And we've got no dependency on any single advertiser. The nice thing about mobile gaming is that it is a very commoditized industry when it comes to advertising. All of our mobile gaming categories have multiple gaming companies that all look very similar to the naked eye. They certainly have different products. But if you think about some of our biggest advertisers, they make solitaire games or they make puzzle games, and there's 100 other ones of them that look the same, and most of them are marketing on our platform. So even if a couple of them start struggling as businesses, the other ones just fill in the gap. Therefore, we look at our businesses in a very stable place, and we don't see much more deteriorating going forward.\nMatthew Cost: So would it be fair to assume then that your quarter ahead guidance does not contemplate material further deterioration?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, I think we said, stable.\nMatthew Cost: Got it. Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Matt. Okay. We'll take our next question from Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse. Stephen, go ahead.\nStephen Ju: All right. Thanks guys. So Adam, to dig into the AXON topic a little bit more. I think you've previously talked about how it has helped you guys drive I think it was a 500% improvement in the accuracy of what as you are showing. So have those improvements been fairly steady over the last couple of years? Or do they tend to show up in large steps as you think about what kind of effective CPI improvements you could drive over the longer-term? And also if you can update us on where you are in the transition of the mediation solution from, I guess, the more waterfall to real-time bidding? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. So on the first, obviously, when we rolled out the AXON upgrade, there were huge step-ups of growth. And when you roll out a core technology like that, it has to get adopted by all your advertisers. So we have very predictable growth that was in the double-digits, I think it around 30% for four subsequent quarters. That accuracy came from the upgrade in the engine. Then we've had incremental changes every step of the way. A material upgrade to the engine really is a step function opportunity, whereas your incremental upgrades end up just baked into your numbers. This isn't to do with CPI though. It's not that we were able to improve the accuracy and drive up CPI. Our goal is to say advertisers have their goals. Our advertisers are willing to spend today in our platform of whatever return on ad spend goals they've set, the amount that they're willing to spend. We have a lot of excess budget that we're not able to fulfill today. So if we're able to improve the accuracy of our predictive engine, we'll be able to fulfill that excess budget and maintain advertiser rates similar to where they are. So that the advertiser is happy, and we're growing our business. And that's the opportunity that we're excited about. That's a performance business at its core. So on the second question, and the move from mediation to real time bidding, we've talked about this in the past. There were some early adopters of real time bidding, and a lot of the market is going to move there over time. And there's just some technology companies that are still getting to the point of being able to support real time bidding instance. Now the biggest and most interesting partner there for us in the future is Google. There was an announcement a couple of months ago about their investment in real time bidding. We're one of the launch partners for their efforts there. They're starting to see strong success there. We love that partnership. And together, if we can facilitate Google moving towards real-time bidding, it will really end up tilting the majority of the market over to it. We're excited about that. It will create efficiency gains for publishers, incremental revenue for the publisher that will then flow back into user acquisition. Obviously, we can charge for it. So it improves the business opportunity we have with the MAX products. And so we think there's a lot of gains to be had there over the coming quarters and years.\nStephen Ju: And Herald, I think up to 40% of your revenue base is coming in from international given the strength of the U.S. dollar that had to have put the squeeze on revenue growth for you guys a little bit. So can you talk about the FX headwinds probably separated for perhaps the software business as well as apps? Thanks.\nHerald Chen: Yes, for us, a lot of the app side is transacted in dollars and through app stores. And so really more of the FX headwind is probably more macroeconomic. And then if people are just transacting in a currency, then it's always translated into dollars for us. So we don't actually for our specific P&L, on the software side as well, we don't have like a big FX headwind on our P&L. It would be just if there was some currency translation of someone buying a good in a game itself, for example, you might see it there. But for us directly, it's not a big impact.\nStephen Ju: Got you. Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Stephen. We'll, next go to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason, please go ahead. Hey Jason please check that your -- that you've unmuted yourself. Go ahead and ask your question. Okay. We'll next go to Omar Dessouky at Bank of America. Omar, please go ahead. Omar please check that you've unmuted yourself.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Can you hear me now?\nAdam Foroughi: We can.\nOmar Dessouky: You can. Great. Okay. Yes. So look, in terms of specifically these other big players in the market that have been dominant prior to IDFA. They're making a lot of investments into kind of privacy-enhancing technologies and infrastructure and presumably once they get around to completing that and have it available for general use, market share could kind of shift back to them. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts on how long -- like how many years that would take before some of these players like Facebook could get there?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Thanks for the question, Omar. We can't comment on what other people are investing into or how long those investment efforts will take. But the reality of our sector is we want the pie to be growing. If the pie is growing, it means advertisers, these mobile gaming companies in general are able to reinvest more dollars into user acquisition. And we've got a strong share of that pie. We've always had a strong share of that pie. We had a very strong growing business prior to the IDFA change. We didn't really change a whole lot after the IDFA change and now we're just caught up in the macroeconomic cycle. But the reality is that IDFA change is a burden on the growth of the whole sector. We want our advertisers, including our own gaming studios to be able to invest on Facebook and other properties as successfully as they possibly can. The deployment of dollars in efficacious and ROAS-based advertising, creates this upside to the category that did fuel a decade of consistent growth. Take that away and it creates a handicap. So we have no fear to that. We hope that all the technologies in the ecosystem continue to innovate and improve. We also, as a possible growth opportunity are hoping that Apple and the other -- and Google and other platforms bring more inventory online because as Apple continues to invest in their advertising efforts and they've talked about bringing more inventory online, it creates more places for these same advertisers to go invest and again grow their business. Because our business is performance-based, that never means that we lose budget. It just means that the businesses of our advertisers will improve, which then ends up allowing them to be more stable companies and reinvest back into our platform as well.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. So if I heard you right, it sounds like you're saying that a resurgence of those dominant companies pre-IDFA is actually more of like a tailwind and benefit for you guys rather than headwind and\u2026\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. We want a growing sector. In a growing sector and a predictably growing one where companies can reinvest their dollars. Everyone is winning together. And we have market leadership technologies when it comes to monetization, mediation and growth. And so we've got a very strong base to our business. We were always totally fine doing very well, growing consistently prior to the IDFA change and we'll see that afterwards if these companies do make their technologies more efficient again.\nRyan Gee: Any other follow-ups, Omar?\nOmar Dessouky: No other follow-ups. Thank you very much.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Great. Thanks, Omar. We'll next go to Franco Granda with D.A. Davidson. Franco go ahead.\nFranco Granda Penaherrera: Yes. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions here. I was wondering, how many studios are you down to at the moment? How many do you own? And how should we think about the performance-based payments for the studios given the lower expected revenues?\nHerald Chen: Yes, we've have about a dozen studios now, and we are -- as I think I mentioned before, in process of renegotiating some of those payments. The vast majority that have already been paid out. And some of those studios are obviously not performing and not going to hit their earnouts either. And so the projected earn-out payments are not terribly significant. We hope as we restructure them in a way that there's more alignment for the new world and the new expectations that they succeed and we succeed along the way. So they're very much going to be aligned with our success going forward.\nFranco Granda Penaherrera: Awesome. Thanks for the color. And then can you speak to what the business at Wurl is like at the moment? Where do you expect it to end for the year relative to your expectations entering the year? And then maybe any color around customer engagements that could translate into revenue next year?\nHerald Chen: Yes, Wurl. We're excited to own Wurl. Obviously, it's a very big category. If you've been looking at some releases of companies that are involved in the CTV category seems to be the one place that there's some green shoots and some growth. So we're excited to be entering the category and assessing our best strategies there. Wurl in and of itself in terms of revenue still very -- relatively small but growthful. It's in the $30 million, $40 million, $50 million range in terms of where it's going to grow to in the near term. So not meaningful from our revenue standpoint but it is very strategic, given the inventory that they operate with, given all the partners that use them for the distribution of content. We think it's an interesting way to enter the category instead of us trying to do it from a standing start. And they've got a team of people that are thinking about it every single day. And as Adam mentioned earlier, we're very much partnered up with them on the technology side, using our ad tech technology and their experience and expertise in the CTV category to figure out what our best plays are. But that's going to be a longer-term play for us. It is a big category. We want to figure out how to get it right. It's very dynamic. A lot of players in the space. And Wurl is going up and groups coming together. So it's something we're very focused on and excited about, but still pretty early.\nFranco Granda Penaherrera: Thank you. That's it for me.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thank you, Franco. We'll next go to Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Martin, go ahead.\nMartin Yang: Hey Ryan, can you hear me?\nRyan Gee: We can hear you Martin.\nMartin Yang: Good afternoon. I want to dig in to the mechanics on a diversified publisher scale back UA and focus on ROEs. How -- assuming a customer's yours does the same as you treat your apps? And how does it impact your AppDiscovery and AppLovin Exchange, respectively?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. So that's only directly impactful to us, Martin, on the AppDiscovery side, the ALX business is third-party demand sources that aggregate a lot of demand that may have the same or different models to us. But on the AppDiscovery product, if there's a customer to say, for instance, wants to spend $1,000 a day at 10% return on ad spend, willing to make $100 a day in the first 24 hours, our systems are very good at driving advertising for them that will yield that return. Now that may back into somewhere around, let's call it, a day 270 return on ad spend, where they break even on the $1,000 spent, and they may be looking at this economy and saying, we can't afford to wait 270 days anymore to breakeven on $1 invested. So they pull back that date. What they would do is they'd go, we're willing to spend the same $1,000, but now get us 20% return on ad spend in the first 24 hours. And again, that in our system, it's all programmatic. So they changed the goal, it instantly will flow through the system and the advertising now will try to find users that will yield twice the return on ad spend that yesterday's budget and targets would have gone and yielded. And so that's really the change that has flowed through the industry is that as advertisers have had to get tighter with the cash that they're able to invest on user acquisition. Those just automatically flow through our system. Now also as this economy goes the other way and we get back to a growth period, hopefully at some point into the future, it will go the other way where they lower their goals and automatically will have a step up in the dollars that we can go spend on their behalf to drive them their new economic goals.\nMartin Yang: One more follow-up on margins for software platform. So aside from your own investment decisions regarding OpEx and anything else that are in your control, what are the potential factors that could impact your software platform margin?\nHerald Chen: Hey no Martin, we report on a net revenue basis to start with. So we do take out the vagaries of having a gross to net in our net revenue. So below the line there, though, it's really the data center costs, which we talked about before, and we have our contract in place and that we have a very good handle on to know what that cost will be. Our team is in place. Yes, we were trying to add awesome talent that's available to us now. But we're not talking about dozens and dozens of people at a time. So I wouldn't see any real significant increase there. Our new initiatives, we are spending against already. So it is in the P&L and part of our operating expenses today. Now if one of them catches fire, do we increase dramatically there potentially. But as Adam said, we've always been very cash flow-focused and return focused. We'll do the right thing there. And by the way, likewise, on the app portfolio, and we've been targeting to get our margins up. But if there is a game that we see in the past, we've done that with Project Makeover and others. But there's a game that we see that has a great return on ad spend, we will spend there to and possibly bring down margins on a quarterly basis as we scale our game. But on the software side, we have a high degree of confidence and visibility into that. Now mid-60s margin structure, including new initiatives. And if our core technology ramps up, there's a significant amount of flow-through per incremental dollar to the bottom line given the fact that our infrastructure is basically fixed at this point as well as our team has paid for as well.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Martin. We'll next go to Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Ralph, go ahead.\nRalph Schackart: Thanks for taking the question. I jumped on late, so I apologize if this has been asked. But can you maybe talk about sort of the softness that you saw in the quarter and maybe sort of the pace of that. And I think on the call, you had said that you feel that stuff is -- that the business has stabilized. Just trying to understand sort of the linear area of the pullback and sort of the comments around stabilization? That's the first one. And then I have a follow-up, please.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Ralph, we referenced it in the last call, but we've been pretty stable since our last big step-up growth quarter. It's not that we're seeing any trends change late in the quarter at all since then. We signaled that we thought it would be relatively flat on the quarter, it was. We see the same thing going forward. Right now, we're in an ecosystem that sort of has priced in all of this difficulty on the macro side and difficulty on the targeting side. And so we see stability everywhere in this business at the moment, and that gives us a lot of comfort with where we're at.\nRalph Schackart: Okay. And then just a clarifying question from the shareholder letter talked about during Q3 within Apps business about the sale of nonstrategic assets. Did you sell off something during the quarter?\nHerald Chen: Yes, there was one that actually a very, very small asset that we sold back to the founders. They were trying to develop a new game that wasn't going to come to fruition so that they wanted to own the entity going forward. So it's a very, very small asset.\nRalph Schackart: Okay. Thanks Adam. Thanks Herald.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thank you, Ralph. We'll go ahead and take our last question from David Pang with Stifel. David, go ahead.\nDavid Pang: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to see if you could provide an update on the DSPs that were transitioning from MoPub to MAX that you highlighted last quarter. And then for Herald, how are you thinking about leverage in general in a rising rate environment? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: TSB side, we use the word stable again, super stable. We are cut over on pretty much all the MoPub DSPs at this point. Really, the shift is a year ago, there's a lot more brand dollars in the ecosystem. A lot of these DSPs are advantageous for us because they're hedged on our business. They go tap into brand dollars, which is not something we've traditionally focused on. And all of those big vendors are live on our platform. They're doing very well. They like the new infrastructure and system. MAX plus MoPub is over 2x bigger than what MoPub was for them. So in terms of the pipes being connected up to the DSPs were there in terms of them being able to spend materially more than they were doing in the past, we're actually there as well because our business is so much bigger. But in the long-term, there's really going to be an opportunity there as this economy recovers for these DSPs to flow more dollars to our system.\nHerald Chen: Yes, David, thanks for the question. Yes. So on the leverage side, we feel very comfortable with where we sit today. We're at just over 2x net leverage, which is very reasonable. We have 4Bs in terms of the rating. So we feel comfortable there as well. Of course, interest rates have gone up significantly and something that we watch. We did hedge out for the year, or some of the interest -- actually more than half of the interest to fixed for the year. Our duration also is fairly strong. So we have maturities coming in '25 and '28, but we can live with our term loans. There's no maintenance covenants or anything like that on it as well. So it does provide us quite a bit of flexibility. So we're very, very comfortable with the current leverage levels, and we still generate after interest cost, significant amount of free cash flow. As we described before, we have a relatively modest tax rate, given a bunch of deductions. We have very little CapEx to us in there, just a little bit of lease expense. We are able to flow through a very strong percentage even with the amount of leverage we're carrying today.\nRyan Gee: David, did you have any follow-ups there?\nDavid Pang: No, we're good.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Well, thank you everyone, for joining. That does conclude our call for today. We appreciate you hopping on, and we'll speak with you all next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thanks all for joining us today. As this market continues to be difficult, it's easy to get disappointed, but you're not going to hear any disappointment from me today. I've been building businesses for nearly two decades now. And one thing I know is it takes years, not quarters to build the great business. We have several things to be excited about at AppLovin today. First, in '22, we're going to generate over $1 billion of EBITDA, growing nearly 50% over '21. We're going to convert a majority of this to cash. Our ability to generate so much cash allows us to patiently address our market and go after the business opportunities in front of us even in a difficult market. Second, our business is incredibly stable. It's easy to look at our industry and realize how difficult it is right now, but it's really easy also to forget how big a sector we're in. Everyone's got a mobile device. Most people are playing mobile games. Many people are playing mobile games every single day. The size and stability of our category as well as our market-leading technologies give us a lot of confidence in our business long-term. So what are we focused on at AppLovin today that gives us a lot of confidence that as we go through this economic downturn and come out, we're going to be a stronger business for it? First and most importantly, we're focused on retaining our core team. Many of our key contributors have been at the company for many years. I've had the pleasure of working with each and every one of you. We're going to continue to invest at AppLovin to make it a great place to work at. Second, we're really focused on attracting new talent. Over the last decade, there's been a talent crunch in Silicon Valley. More recently, we're getting resumes from incredibly qualified individuals better than we've ever seen before. The opportunity to attract new talent and pair with our existing and exceptional team gets us very excited. Third, we're working tirelessly to improve our core technologies. We see a path to doing so. And if we're successful, it will allow us to create growth that we can control. Fourth, we're still investing in new initiatives, and we're very excited about these. They utilize our core technologies and core competencies and will enable us to go into bigger market opportunities. If we're successful here, we'll create immense upside for both our shareholders and team. And lastly, we'll continue to be strategic with our cash. We'll look at share buybacks. We'll also use this moment in time to try to attract new investors, shareholders that are going to be focused on our long-term vision, just as we are. The market today presents a low multiple entry point into our company. What's interesting about that is we generate a ton of cash, so it gives us a good base, and we're also going after very, very big opportunities. If we're successful in executing around our vision over the coming years, we're going to create outsized returns, private market like returns. That opportunity gets us really excited. In fact, we're working harder today at AppLovin than we've ever worked before because of that upside. I'll now hand you off to Herald. All good, thanks, Tim. Thanks, Tim. So a couple of things packed in there that I'm going to address. First, we're on our mediation platform and also AppDiscovery platform, we're market leaders. The MAX platform, that's our mediation solution probably has the vast majority of all the ad inventory in the gaming sector running through it. Now what's interesting about that is it gives us access to a diverse set of advertisers where we're not dependent on any individual one. And most companies this year have been going through their P&L and really cutting costs. So marketing and OpEx, so most companies are at a stable point now where you're seeing the gaming market not growing because of that because of the focus on cash flow but you've also had that happen. And because we've got a lot of diversity and because the sector is so big and consumers are still engaging with mobile games as much as they've ever engaged before. And the biggest change was just this handicap of shift from growth investment to cash flow, and that's already been baked in. That gives us a lot of confidence in the stability of our business that I referenced in my comments a couple of minutes ago. Yes, we can. So I'll touch on the first point, and then we can come back to revenue from non-spec because frankly, I think that's just a very small percentage of our numbers. So it's going to be a volatile metric that doesn't, frankly, matter a whole lot. When you think about the business as it is, again, we're very strong in the market. We have very consistent business. So there's no share loss anywhere in our core technologies. They work really well for the mobile game developer. And the one thing that we can't control that gives us hesitation on having long-term guidance right now is this focus of cash flow amongst our advertiser base and frankly, any company in technology today and away from growth. That's been baked into a lot of businesses at this point. Most managers are savvy enough to now have made the changes there. We just don't know when that reverses out. When the economy is going to turn around, when there will be a shift back to growth and sort of when you get to the bottom of this economic downturn. What we do know and that gives us confidence is we're already there and the business is very stable. We also know that our core technology has a lot of room to improve. That was another thing I touched on is that we're working really hard to improve it. And really, we have two paths to grow. One is advertisers are willing to invest more into growth and cash flow. So they're going to lower their goals and invest more dollars into our platform. The other is entirely in our control. It's improving the efficacy of our solution so that we're able to take the dollar spent. And even at a tighter set of goals, drive more scale to our advertising partners. We see a path to doing that, and that's what we're working on today. Both of those things give us a lot of confidence that we're going to have a strong baseline where we are in terms of the cash that we're able to generate, and we have room to grow as well that both has one factor outside of our control and one factor entirely within our control. And our overall ability to improve our core technologies. Yes. Honestly, we don't actually look at each individual business. None of these partners make up a big part of our business. It's just as a whole, we all know that every company is under a lot of pressure right now to cut costs. So there has been just cost-cutting and budgetary constraints across the advertising sector. That's impacted most businesses, whether small or big. I'll take the first question, Eric, and Herald will jump on the second. When it comes to our core business, we're pretty large scale at this point. We've talked about processing billions of dollars a year of advertising budget, and we're netting quite a bit, well over $1 billion a year of software revenue. And so at that level of scale, we built very good core technologies there. We also touched on a couple of letters ago about some investments in new initiatives. These have option value in our business. Frankly, like I said, I've been building businesses over a couple of decades. It takes years to be able to build the business to make an impact on a business as large scale as ours. But what gives us confidence going after these is they use the same core technologies and core competencies as our main business. One of those is extending our advertising solution to CTV. We did an acquisition there with a team role that we're very excited about. They have core technologies that are differentiated. And as we get our ad technologies to be sophisticated enough to extend to CTV, which is a work in progress, there'll be a go-to-market there, too, and the two technologies will couple together. Initiatives like that, we're not baking into any of our forward outlook or a thought process around the short term in the business, but we think long-term will create immense shareholder value and value for our team. Thanks, Clark. I'll go the second first and then back to the first question. We're focused on investing in new initiatives but we know how to build businesses with a cash flow mindset from the very beginning. As a company at AppLovin, we were profitable our second month in operation. And every one of these new initiatives, we take that same approach into. We're excited about the opportunity. We leverage a lot of the resources that we already have in place and the incremental investments that we're making into them are not material given the market opportunity that they present us. We'll continue to approach any business opportunity that way. We think of them as startups and the GMs that we have running those businesses also think of them as the CEO of a start-up. And when you have a new business that you're trying to incubate and build, a lot of times, you want to do it organically, make sure the product market fit is there, not overinvest early, and then we will invest behind growth as we know that we have something that's hot. And at that point in time, we'll talk about these businesses because in theory, they'll be making an impact to our numbers, both revenue and cost. And on the first question, when it comes to core technology, we always measure the error rate in our predictive engine. The whole model is predicated on being able to predict what are users going to download and engage with next and driving value to our advertisers. Value comes from revenue. So we've got to be very, very good at predicting a future event. And we know that there's error in our system. There's a lot of incremental changes that we, as a technology company, will do at all times. But very rarely, we'll go and rebuild a lot of our core system. We're doing both right now. And the last time we rebuilt a lot of our core systems to try to get an upgrade was actually the initial release of AXON, which was now, I think, about two years ago and obviously facilitated a ton of growth in our business. We're very excited about the potential of all of our investments in technology into our future. Yes, we can. Yes. So I'll take the second first again, just top of mind. Look, we're investing in our business as it is. We run a high margin business, because we've got a lean team, but we've got an exceptional team that creates a lot of output. We've been run entrepreneurial since the get-go. So there's no shortage of investment against things that we see as opportunities. We've got new initiatives that we're investing into. We've got a technological rerate that we're investing into. And we're organizing a lot of the acquisitions that we've made over the last couple of years to be more advantageous for our business going forward. So we've not stopped investing and we'll continue to invest both in growth opportunities that we see in front of us right now and those that we come up with in the future. Nothing about the market is going to change that because we do generate enough cash to be opportunistic enough to be able to invest in things that we deem worthwhile even in today's market. Now when it comes to the market itself, mobile gaming has been declining. People are still consuming the same amount of mobile games, though. The big change, there's been two changes. One is, as we've talked about macroeconomic, where a lot of companies are focused on cash flow and away from revenue growth. That's just a requirement. That's already baked into the advertising ecosystem. The other changes that came obviously in our sector right around the same time as the economy fell off is that IDFA change. And traditionally, mobile gaming companies were able to spend a lot of their revenue back in the user acquisition, namely on some big social properties to be able to grow. Those buys had the best return on ad spend. They were highly targeted, and they were able to use those profits to subsidize future growth. Take that away, and you have two things that really hit the category. And both those happen at the same time. So you can't really decouple them. Both are also baked into the business. Our business, we're fortunate enough to have a massive penetration in the market we operate in. Our mediation product is market leading and our AppDiscovery product is market leading. And we've got no dependency on any single advertiser. The nice thing about mobile gaming is that it is a very commoditized industry when it comes to advertising. All of our mobile gaming categories have multiple gaming companies that all look very similar to the naked eye. They certainly have different products. But if you think about some of our biggest advertisers, they make solitaire games or they make puzzle games, and there's 100 other ones of them that look the same, and most of them are marketing on our platform. So even if a couple of them start struggling as businesses, the other ones just fill in the gap. Therefore, we look at our businesses in a very stable place, and we don't see much more deteriorating going forward. Yes, I think we said, stable. Yes. So on the first, obviously, when we rolled out the AXON upgrade, there were huge step-ups of growth. And when you roll out a core technology like that, it has to get adopted by all your advertisers. So we have very predictable growth that was in the double-digits, I think it around 30% for four subsequent quarters. That accuracy came from the upgrade in the engine. Then we've had incremental changes every step of the way. A material upgrade to the engine really is a step function opportunity, whereas your incremental upgrades end up just baked into your numbers. This isn't to do with CPI though. It's not that we were able to improve the accuracy and drive up CPI. Our goal is to say advertisers have their goals. Our advertisers are willing to spend today in our platform of whatever return on ad spend goals they've set, the amount that they're willing to spend. We have a lot of excess budget that we're not able to fulfill today. So if we're able to improve the accuracy of our predictive engine, we'll be able to fulfill that excess budget and maintain advertiser rates similar to where they are. So that the advertiser is happy, and we're growing our business. And that's the opportunity that we're excited about. That's a performance business at its core. So on the second question, and the move from mediation to real time bidding, we've talked about this in the past. There were some early adopters of real time bidding, and a lot of the market is going to move there over time. And there's just some technology companies that are still getting to the point of being able to support real time bidding instance. Now the biggest and most interesting partner there for us in the future is Google. There was an announcement a couple of months ago about their investment in real time bidding. We're one of the launch partners for their efforts there. They're starting to see strong success there. We love that partnership. And together, if we can facilitate Google moving towards real-time bidding, it will really end up tilting the majority of the market over to it. We're excited about that. It will create efficiency gains for publishers, incremental revenue for the publisher that will then flow back into user acquisition. Obviously, we can charge for it. So it improves the business opportunity we have with the MAX products. And so we think there's a lot of gains to be had there over the coming quarters and years. We can. Yes. Thanks for the question, Omar. We can't comment on what other people are investing into or how long those investment efforts will take. But the reality of our sector is we want the pie to be growing. If the pie is growing, it means advertisers, these mobile gaming companies in general are able to reinvest more dollars into user acquisition. And we've got a strong share of that pie. We've always had a strong share of that pie. We had a very strong growing business prior to the IDFA change. We didn't really change a whole lot after the IDFA change and now we're just caught up in the macroeconomic cycle. But the reality is that IDFA change is a burden on the growth of the whole sector. We want our advertisers, including our own gaming studios to be able to invest on Facebook and other properties as successfully as they possibly can. The deployment of dollars in efficacious and ROAS-based advertising, creates this upside to the category that did fuel a decade of consistent growth. Take that away and it creates a handicap. So we have no fear to that. We hope that all the technologies in the ecosystem continue to innovate and improve. We also, as a possible growth opportunity are hoping that Apple and the other -- and Google and other platforms bring more inventory online because as Apple continues to invest in their advertising efforts and they've talked about bringing more inventory online, it creates more places for these same advertisers to go invest and again grow their business. Because our business is performance-based, that never means that we lose budget. It just means that the businesses of our advertisers will improve, which then ends up allowing them to be more stable companies and reinvest back into our platform as well. Yes. We want a growing sector. In a growing sector and a predictably growing one where companies can reinvest their dollars. Everyone is winning together. And we have market leadership technologies when it comes to monetization, mediation and growth. And so we've got a very strong base to our business. We were always totally fine doing very well, growing consistently prior to the IDFA change and we'll see that afterwards if these companies do make their technologies more efficient again. Yes. So that's only directly impactful to us, Martin, on the AppDiscovery side, the ALX business is third-party demand sources that aggregate a lot of demand that may have the same or different models to us. But on the AppDiscovery product, if there's a customer to say, for instance, wants to spend $1,000 a day at 10% return on ad spend, willing to make $100 a day in the first 24 hours, our systems are very good at driving advertising for them that will yield that return. Now that may back into somewhere around, let's call it, a day 270 return on ad spend, where they break even on the $1,000 spent, and they may be looking at this economy and saying, we can't afford to wait 270 days anymore to breakeven on $1 invested. So they pull back that date. What they would do is they'd go, we're willing to spend the same $1,000, but now get us 20% return on ad spend in the first 24 hours. And again, that in our system, it's all programmatic. So they changed the goal, it instantly will flow through the system and the advertising now will try to find users that will yield twice the return on ad spend that yesterday's budget and targets would have gone and yielded. And so that's really the change that has flowed through the industry is that as advertisers have had to get tighter with the cash that they're able to invest on user acquisition. Those just automatically flow through our system. Now also as this economy goes the other way and we get back to a growth period, hopefully at some point into the future, it will go the other way where they lower their goals and automatically will have a step up in the dollars that we can go spend on their behalf to drive them their new economic goals. Yes. Ralph, we referenced it in the last call, but we've been pretty stable since our last big step-up growth quarter. It's not that we're seeing any trends change late in the quarter at all since then. We signaled that we thought it would be relatively flat on the quarter, it was. We see the same thing going forward. Right now, we're in an ecosystem that sort of has priced in all of this difficulty on the macro side and difficulty on the targeting side. And so we see stability everywhere in this business at the moment, and that gives us a lot of comfort with where we're at. TSB side, we use the word stable again, super stable. We are cut over on pretty much all the MoPub DSPs at this point. Really, the shift is a year ago, there's a lot more brand dollars in the ecosystem. A lot of these DSPs are advantageous for us because they're hedged on our business. They go tap into brand dollars, which is not something we've traditionally focused on. And all of those big vendors are live on our platform. They're doing very well. They like the new infrastructure and system. MAX plus MoPub is over 2x bigger than what MoPub was for them. So in terms of the pipes being connected up to the DSPs were there in terms of them being able to spend materially more than they were doing in the past, we're actually there as well because our business is so much bigger. But in the long-term, there's really going to be an opportunity there as this economy recovers for these DSPs to flow more dollars to our system."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. And as we outlined in our shareholder letter, given the challenging backdrop, we are very much focused on what we control. Firstly, bolstering our leadership positions in our core markets and our core products; and second, using this cash flow that Adam mentioned, to really invest behind initiatives that are focused on increasing the durability of our business, ultimately leading to long-term growth, which will then lead to enterprise value creation. Shifting to the third quarter. Starting with the software business, we grew that 59% year-over-year. And based on our guidance from the second quarter, as expected, it was generally flat to the third quarter. EBITDA grew 49% year-over-year and achieved a 62% margin in the third quarter. We had 538 SPECs, a record in the quarter, and that also had an NDRR, net dollar retention -- revenue retention of 166%. On the App side, which is a midstream or change, operational changes as we previously discussed, the revenue was down 24% year-over-year, but EBITDA, which is where we're focused, was up -- what was up 12% to a 17% margin. So on a combined basis, the total revenue was down slightly year-over-year, but EBITDA was up 35% to $258 million, $1 billion run rate and achieved an EBITDA margin of 36%. Then shifting to our outlook for Q4. We see Q4 coming in fairly similarly to what we achieved in Q3. And if that's the case, then the year, we'll end up at $2.8 billion with a margin structure around 37% to 38% adjusted EBITDA. The component to that we see would be software being over $1 billion in revenue with a mid-60s EBITDA margin. And on the application side, we would see a $1.7-plus billion revenue stream with a margin structure in the mid-teens. Of note, going forward, we will only be providing our forward quarter guidance and will not be providing a full-year guidance in the future. Then talking about cash flow in a little more detail. We do plan on generating $1 billion of EBITDA this year. We also plan on finishing the year with over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And as you all know, we're able to convert a high percentage of the EBITDA to free cash flow, given our very limited amount of CapEx. And as Adam described, we're able to then reinvest those dollars and have the financial flexibility and the patience to invest in projects, not trying to chase quarter-to-quarter growth on things that don't yield long-term return, but really invest behind our team, our talent and our tech to ensure that we're in a great spot going forward. We also have $400 million of availability -- over $400 million of availability on our stock repurchase plan. And given the stock market environment today and the rerating of risk as well as our highly leverageable operating structure, where if we do have growth in our high margin, high cash flow business, we think the combination of today's stock valuations and stock multiples, combined with the ability to have high operating levers when we return to growth, those dollars fall into the bottom line. We think for shareholders and for us in considering stock buybacks could be a very attractive return. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ryan to go through Q&A. Thank you. Eric, on the app side, I think we're making very good progress against our initiatives to get our portfolio to the position we want to get in terms of both the margin and then in a position for growth. So I'd say, really, there's three things that have taken place there. One, was instead of just driving users to gain the data, we really cut back on the UA to make sure that we are driving strong ROAS. And as we know in this marketplace, ROAS is even more difficult to come by. And so we've managed that UA spend. So we're taking revenue hit in exchange for profitability. And then the second lever is just going through the portfolio and saying, well, which ones actually have the ability to drive real enterprise value for us in the long-term. And there's some that frankly need more investment and more team, and there's others that really won't get there. And so we're in the process of winning through that, some of the studios we've just shut down or sold back to the Founder. We're renegotiating some of the earnouts. And again, others were actually investing in quite a few new games. So the third lever will then be ultimately when we get to portfolio that we want to own and grow forward. We think that will be a healthy portfolio. We hope to get there really by the end of this year is what we talked about. And then from there, it really depends if the market recovers in terms of valuations on whether or not we'd actually be able to monetize any significant portion of the portfolio. We may end up owning all of it, or with the right bid, we may end up selling all of it. But given the macroeconomic environment and where purchase multiples might be out there, our focus is very much on owning those assets for now, optimizing them and then figuring out what value creation could be had down the road. And it is a significant amount of value relative to our current enterprise value and would be very accretive and deleveraging to us, we think, with the right price for the right assets. Yes, thanks, Clark. Look, it is a high priority for us to allocate our capital wisely, particularly when there's opportunities that arise. And in this market, maybe it's around stock, maybe there's other assets that have gotten a lot cheaper than we'd want to own or it's just hiring a lot of great people that we didn't have access to before. And so we're taking advantage of this time in making lemonade out of these lemons, and we're glad to have the EBITDA that we do and the cash balance sheet that we have. But certainly, at these stock prices and given all the upside opportunities we see in the free cash flow characteristics and just the cash-on-cash yield that we project out, we certainly are considering stock buyback and we think the sizing of $400 million. We'll have to figure out what's the right amount to use at what period of time. Yes, for us, a lot of the app side is transacted in dollars and through app stores. And so really more of the FX headwind is probably more macroeconomic. And then if people are just transacting in a currency, then it's always translated into dollars for us. So we don't actually for our specific P&L, on the software side as well, we don't have like a big FX headwind on our P&L. It would be just if there was some currency translation of someone buying a good in a game itself, for example, you might see it there. But for us directly, it's not a big impact. Yes, we've have about a dozen studios now, and we are -- as I think I mentioned before, in process of renegotiating some of those payments. The vast majority that have already been paid out. And some of those studios are obviously not performing and not going to hit their earnouts either. And so the projected earn-out payments are not terribly significant. We hope as we restructure them in a way that there's more alignment for the new world and the new expectations that they succeed and we succeed along the way. So they're very much going to be aligned with our success going forward. Yes, Wurl. We're excited to own Wurl. Obviously, it's a very big category. If you've been looking at some releases of companies that are involved in the CTV category seems to be the one place that there's some green shoots and some growth. So we're excited to be entering the category and assessing our best strategies there. Wurl in and of itself in terms of revenue still very -- relatively small but growthful. It's in the $30 million, $40 million, $50 million range in terms of where it's going to grow to in the near term. So not meaningful from our revenue standpoint but it is very strategic, given the inventory that they operate with, given all the partners that use them for the distribution of content. We think it's an interesting way to enter the category instead of us trying to do it from a standing start. And they've got a team of people that are thinking about it every single day. And as Adam mentioned earlier, we're very much partnered up with them on the technology side, using our ad tech technology and their experience and expertise in the CTV category to figure out what our best plays are. But that's going to be a longer-term play for us. It is a big category. We want to figure out how to get it right. It's very dynamic. A lot of players in the space. And Wurl is going up and groups coming together. So it's something we're very focused on and excited about, but still pretty early. Hey no Martin, we report on a net revenue basis to start with. So we do take out the vagaries of having a gross to net in our net revenue. So below the line there, though, it's really the data center costs, which we talked about before, and we have our contract in place and that we have a very good handle on to know what that cost will be. Our team is in place. Yes, we were trying to add awesome talent that's available to us now. But we're not talking about dozens and dozens of people at a time. So I wouldn't see any real significant increase there. Our new initiatives, we are spending against already. So it is in the P&L and part of our operating expenses today. Now if one of them catches fire, do we increase dramatically there potentially. But as Adam said, we've always been very cash flow-focused and return focused. We'll do the right thing there. And by the way, likewise, on the app portfolio, and we've been targeting to get our margins up. But if there is a game that we see in the past, we've done that with Project Makeover and others. But there's a game that we see that has a great return on ad spend, we will spend there to and possibly bring down margins on a quarterly basis as we scale our game. But on the software side, we have a high degree of confidence and visibility into that. Now mid-60s margin structure, including new initiatives. And if our core technology ramps up, there's a significant amount of flow-through per incremental dollar to the bottom line given the fact that our infrastructure is basically fixed at this point as well as our team has paid for as well. Yes, there was one that actually a very, very small asset that we sold back to the founders. They were trying to develop a new game that wasn't going to come to fruition so that they wanted to own the entity going forward. So it's a very, very small asset. Yes, David, thanks for the question. Yes. So on the leverage side, we feel very comfortable with where we sit today. We're at just over 2x net leverage, which is very reasonable. We have 4Bs in terms of the rating. So we feel comfortable there as well. Of course, interest rates have gone up significantly and something that we watch. We did hedge out for the year, or some of the interest -- actually more than half of the interest to fixed for the year. Our duration also is fairly strong. So we have maturities coming in '25 and '28, but we can live with our term loans. There's no maintenance covenants or anything like that on it as well. So it does provide us quite a bit of flexibility. So we're very, very comfortable with the current leverage levels, and we still generate after interest cost, significant amount of free cash flow. As we described before, we have a relatively modest tax rate, given a bunch of deductions. We have very little CapEx to us in there, just a little bit of lease expense. We are able to flow through a very strong percentage even with the amount of leverage we're carrying today."

Joining me today to discuss our results are: our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi; and our President and Chief Financial Officer, Herald Chen. Please note our SEC filings, earnings release and shareholder letter discussing our second quarter performance, are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements regarding future events, expectations regarding the market, the future financial performance of the company, our strategic review of our apps portfolio and our proposal to combine with Unity. These statements are based on our current market assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them, except as required by law. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our press release regarding our proposed combination with Unity and in our Form 10-Q for the second quarter, which we expect to file later this week. This call does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 as amended. This call includes information related to a proposal that we have made for a business combination transaction with Unity Software. In furtherance of this proposal and subject to future developments, we and if a negotiated transaction is agreed to Unity may file 1 or more registration statements, proxy statements, tender offer statements or other documents with the SEC. We urge investors and security holders to read such registration statements, proxy statements, tender offer statements or other documents we or unit to file with the SEC because they will contain important information about the proposed combination. We will also be discussing our non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter available on our Investor Relations site. Please be sure to review the GAAP measures and the reconciliations as the non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our IR website shortly. I'm going to turn it over to Adam to discuss some highlights for the second quarter, and Herald will provide more context on our financial performance and our 2022 outlook. Then we'll open up for Q&A. With that, Adam, please go ahead.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Ryan. Thank you all for joining us today. With our proposal this week, we were really hoping to spice things up at this earnings call. We'll come back to that in a bit. But now I want to start by saying that we are pleased with our performance during the second quarter. We delivered strong year-over-year growth led by our Software Platform business, which grew over 100% over the same period last year. Notably, we surpassed 500 Software Platform enterprise clients and our revenue from those clients and net dollar-based revenue retention also improved year-over-year. We're successfully driving adoption by onboarding new clients and deepening our relationships with the existing ones. I also want to acknowledge the challenging period for the mobile app ecosystem, which was facing a few headwinds going into the quarter and which were compounded by the weaker macro economy. We appreciate the near-term may be challenging so we are hyper focused on the one thing we can control best, continuing to improve our strong software platform technologies. I'm very proud of our team and all of our accomplishments. Let me highlight three of them. First, we successfully completed the shutdown of MoPub. Now that MoPub is fully integrated into MAX and their developers have moved over. We have been focused on strengthening our relationship with all the new partners in the quarter. MAX is on track to hit our goal of a $10 billion a year run rate of media transacted through our platform by the end of the year. MAX is the strongest platform for mobile in-app bidding. Next, we ramped our AppLovin Exchange continuing the migration of MoPub demand partners to our platform. Just as with the publisher integration of MoPub and the MAX, we are rebuilding 10 years of MoPub efforts in a very short amount of time. We want to facilitate success for these DSPs as they migrate and to give back to the publishers that use MAX in a tough economic time. So we reduced our take rate on AppLovin Exchange by nearly half. While we maintain flexibility on the economics of ALX long-term, in the short-term, we felt that this was the right thing to do for our marketplace. Additionally, we successfully integrated World and are already using AppLovin ad tech to start testing mobile gaming advertising campaigns on CTV. While this is still in the early stages of testing, the results are promising. And we're excited for World to bring a true performance-driven approach to advertising for the television market. This past quarter, we updated our strategic and financial approach to our apps business to focus on segment profitability and long-term cash flow growth. We have better aligned our level of investment across the portfolio to both current market conditions and future opportunities. For some studios, our plan may be to sell, close or restructure to maximize value. To increase margins, the most notable change in our approach was a reduction in user acquisition spend for our portfolio of apps as we increased our own desired return goals. The effect of this is that it reduces revenue, which is reflected in our guidance, but will lead to higher margins, much more in line with industry peers. We believe we're mostly through this period of readjustment of revenues and margins and the business will now be in a stable place, able to produce consistent cash flow. With that, let me turn it over to Herald to provide color on our numbers and outlook.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us today. We know you may not have had time to review our shareholder letter just yet, so I'll quickly hit some of the key points. As you already know, we are operating in a more challenging environment, notwithstanding though, given the focus and execution of our AppLovin teams around the globe, we are able to continue to grow our top line year-over-year to $776 million, which is a 16% increase led by our Software Platform business. That growth, plus improvements in cash flow from our apps business resulted in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 47% to $270 million. That equates to a 35% margin, which is the highest normalized EBITDA margin we posted since being public. We also introduced segment reporting this quarter, which allows us to provide you more information regarding the progress of our businesses. Starting with the Software Platform segment, we had $318 million of revenue, which was up 118% year-over-year. We continue to deliver highly performance solutions to our most important customers as evidenced by our record 503 enterprise customers with an increase in net dollar-based revenue retention of 204% on an LTM basis. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, all of our software solutions had some growth, except for ALX, which in the aggregate led to a quarterly decline of minus 3%. The ALX decline was due to a migration of DSP demand from Twitter's platform in Q1 to our ALX platform in Q2, which takes some time to ramp. And as Adam mentioned, we proactively reduced the take rate from DSPs to get pass more dollars along to our publishers. Importantly, from a cash flow standpoint, our Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 114% year-over-year to $197 million, representing a margin of 62%. While certainly a strong margin overall, in particular relative to our peers, during the quarter, we incurred step function increases and several costs. First, we have technology infrastructure costs that we discussed before, including additional data center capacity to support new publishers and demand partners onboarded from MoPub acquisition. And headcount costs, we're now including the team from World, our recently acquired Connected TV platform. For the second half of 2012, importantly, we do not foresee meaningful increases in the Software Platform cost. Therefore, we expect our software platform adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 65% and 70% for the year, consistent with our previous range. Regarding software revenue performance for the year, we have confidence we will deliver against our guidance. In the second and third quarter summer months are slower -- a slower part of the year for mobile gaming. But importantly, for our business, the primary driver of our software platform business growth is App Discovery, which is, of course, powered by AXON. The ability for us to more than double revenue over the past year and more than quintuple revenue over the past two years is largely driven by the continuous improvements in AXON. As we find improvements to our technology, we will realize meaningful increases in software revenue, which will flow through at very high margins. We do expect more of these improvements to occur over time, which supports our outlook for this year and beyond. Turning to the app side. As Adam described, our new approach to managing the portfolio is to focus on optimizing the business for financial return. Our efforts and progress are already evident in our second quarter numbers. Our apps adjusted EBITDA increased from $41 million in Q1 to $73 million. Margins expanded from 8% to 16%. Our bigger-than-expected reduction in spend, in particular in user acquisition impacts the top line in the near term, and therefore, we meaningfully reduced our apps revenue guidance by $300 million for the year. By 2023, our goal is to position the apps portfolio to have a healthy business model where we can grow the top line and earn a solid margin. Closing out on guidance, we did not make any other changes to guidance, including holding the midpoint of '22 EBITDA at $1.2 billion. We can do so given our high-margin Software Platform business and our ability to drive higher margins now in our apps portfolio. Overall, we remain highly confident in the stand-alone long-term value creation potential for our business given our top line prospects and cash generation potential. To that end, we were able to buy back approximately $340 million of our stock under our $750 million buyback program at an average price of $38 per share. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to turn it back to Adam to address the unique partnership proposal we made this week to the Unity Board.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Herald. We'll be happy to answer as much as we can on the call, but I wanted to address some of the key points now. First, why now? Over the last decade, we've been an innovative company focused on building marketing and monetization solutions for app developers. At the same time, we've always had a lot of admiration for what Unity has built with their create and operate businesses. Our goals have always been very similar, helping grow the app economy by giving tools to creators to help them turn their ideas into growing businesses. In the past, internally, we've discussed the strategic rationale to bring the two companies together, but at the time, it didn't make sense for a few reasons. Up until a couple of years ago, our ad tech business was very similar to Unity operate. We were both successful in growing ad networks. But in the last two years, we launched our machine learning engine, AXON, which powers our ad network and helped it grow by over 500% since. We integrated MoPub into MAX creating the best in-app monetization platform for developers. And we added Adjust giving us one of the leading mobile attribution and analytics companies. In particular, because of the strength of AXON, we now see a path to unlocking very meaningful synergies by bringing the two companies together. When Unity announced their ironSource deal, we started analyzing these synergies, and we were excited by the possibilities as they could be over $700 million in just three years. We also weren't sure that Unity would be open to improving their technologies through a merger. Their ironSource bid made it clear that they now see the potential of a full stack solution, and given the synergies we assessed, we felt it necessary to put a thoughtful proposal out there of what our combined companies would look like. To be clear, we are confident in our standalone prospects. However, the combined business offers additional scale, data and reach, which if constructed correctly, would be accretive to the market and to all of our shareholders. So how did we arrive at over $700 million of synergies? Simple, it\u2019s based on the numbers and gains we see from our marketing and monetization solutions. In Q1 2021, our first full quarter with AXON, our Software revenue was $88 million. At the time, Unity operate reported $146 million revenue. This past quarter, our Software business reported $318 million of revenue compared to Unity operate reporting $158 million. The fast growth of our Software business allows us to apply the trend and get us really excited about what we could unlock together. AXON is extremely good at predicting which apps users will engage with MAX, but it can always be improved. We have two paths to this continued improvement: one, as we've touched on, our code improvements to lower error rates in our predictions; another and just as important is more access to data, which strengthens our algorithms. With the reach of Unity create, combined with the reach of our marketing and monetization solutions, the data sets of the two companies would be even more compelling. That incremental data should give us the potential to drive material lifts in our combined businesses. In 2023, separately, our Software business plus Unity's operate business would be projected to be over $2.5 billion in revenue. We believe just next year, the incremental data flowing into AXON would create material gains and it only takes 20% improvement to the accuracy of our algorithms to generate $500 million more revenue with nearly 100% flow-through. And what does this mean for the industry as a whole? This $500 million is net revenue. So if you gross it up to what advertisers would spend in round, you get $2 billion extra of performance spending in the combined platform just from synergies. Now remember, we sized the advertising market in mobile games for you at $25 billion in a prior shareholder letter. So the synergies alone would unlock 8% growth in the whole market. This would be a catalyst for growth in our market for years to come. Why did we make the proposal we did? Our proposal was constructed to best position the combined company to drive strong returns for AppLovin and Unity shareholders. We know the Unity Board would need to find our proposal superior to their current option on the table, and we believe we've done just that. While ironSource is a great business, the scale we operate at is just much greater. We believe our proposal offers both superior terms and a stronger partner in technology, scale, cash flow and strategic position. Importantly, we have AXON proven to be super impactful and the efficiencies that could unlock our immense. From a cash flow standpoint, our business alone will generate over $1 billion of EBITDA this year whereas our current combined plan contemplates reaching that in 2025. From a pure price standpoint, our proposal is at one-half the EBITDA multiple versus their existing deal. We strongly believe this is also good for AppLovin shareholders. We're very confident we can quickly unlock synergies and the longer-term strategic strength of the business would be very compelling creating the unquestionable leader in a growth category and a Software business with strong growth and cash flow prospects for as long as people will use mobile devices. This would benefit shareholders on both sides making ownership in the joint company really valuable. Now importantly, our personal decision around why I'm willing to take a backseat on the CEO role. My motivations of every step of our business were to build a bigger platform and truly innovate. I've never been motivated by power, equity or needing to be the face of an organization. I've been committed long term to what we've built here because this is my life's work, and I'm incredibly proud of everyone I work with here who continue to contribute to building great things. This combined company could potentially become a $100 billion enterprise, and that gets me really excited. John Ricantello is a strong leader and CEO for Unity, We've known each other for years, and I believe that together with our combined teams, there's a huge opportunity to capitalize on. COO means many things, but in this case, integration will be a key to unlocking the revenue and efficiency gains we would be asking our shareholders to believe in. I would owe it to you all to spend my time ensuring success there. So what's next? We are not going to speculate on the outcome of our proposal, but we feel strongly that we have put forth an offer the Unity's Board, its shareholders and our AppLovin shareholders should find compelling and be as excited about as we are. In the meantime, our team remains focused on the three strategic priorities we outlined in our shareholder letter, and we feel very strongly about our ability to continue to grow our business, whether we're successful on this proposal or not. We continue to see exceptional opportunities driven by improvements in our Software platform, and we are optimizing our business to improve our margin and our cash generation potential. We've been bold since we went public but really, we've been bold since we started this company. I have the passion and drive to lead an exceptional team to building a $100 billion company, and we will do that here with or without this deal. But we're definitely excited that this merger can accelerate both of our paths to that goal. Now happy to take your questions.\nA - Ryan Gee: We'd be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay, it looks like we have a few raise hands. So first, we'll take our first question from Clark Lampen at BTIG.\nClark Lampen: Thanks, guys. Can you hear me okay? Hi, can you hear me, okay. Okay perfect. Thanks, guys. Hey, Adam, I guess, just for starters, I wanted to unpack some of the things that you were talking about with sort of 2Q variances with software, the demand, I guess, migration, the cut in the take rate? Any way you could quantify maybe how much of a headwind that was for the quarter? I think if I heard right, it was down 3%. Could you give us a baseline maybe for the first quarter? And then I guess as we step back maybe from Unity deal, you talked about being open to exploring other avenues of growth or sort of scaling the business maybe towards that $100 billion long-term target. Would you think about, I guess, sort of avenues outside of the ad space similar to this deal? Or could you elaborate, I guess, just on big picture strategic priorities, if you could. Thanks a lot.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Clark. I'm going to reverse the answers. Second one, strategic opportunities in the future to expand our TAM and really our market potential. That really aligns with the new initiatives that we've talked about in the past. We're excited about our current market and our leadership position in it, but to expand to the scale that we aspire to get to, we've got to both expand our reach and the monetization potential for the developers that we have great relationships with. One of those new initiatives, CTV expands reach. It's all about tapping into a new audience on a fast-growing platform, and we're now live with the product there. It's just really early stage. But as I touched on in the script, we're seeing positive results already. And then we're also talking about and we released an announcement around Array. Array is now a marketing platform for carriers and OEMs to give them a life cycle native marketing solution to take -- to give them the capacity to deliver better advertising to their customers. We were sharing revenue with those carriers and OEMs and we think that can create a big expansion of reach as well. Then we talked about in the past, NFTs. We're still working on NFTs and blockchain as a new initiative. And really, the idea there is to get into payments. It's to allow our developers to create the transfer of ownership of a digital good to their customers and the transfer of ownership to be a transaction that would flow through our payment mechanism, our own blockchain. If we can execute on these new initiatives, we will be executing and expanding the TAM and giving ourselves a runway for many, many years of growth. Now that said, we have a lot of confidence in our current business. For multiple quarters now, we've had a lot of sequential growth in that business, and that came from AXON. The efficiencies we unlock by improving that technology made our ability to drive better results for advertisers. That's carried forward. The more improvements we make on AXON going forward, the bigger we're going to be able to expand the dollars of flow through our platform, and the bigger we'll be able to create an influence on TAM expansion in the market that we're in today. That creates upside in this business and the core opportunity we have going forward as well. I think, Clark, your other question was around MoPub DSPs. We did bring the MoPub DSPs. We're in the process of transitioning MoPub DSPs over to ALX at the moment. And that\u2019s an ongoing cases. Again, the focus was around publisher migration. Q2 and ongoing will be around getting DSPs onto our platform and ramp. We did make a short-term decision to cut take rate, as I touched on, by a little bit under half. And that was driven by two reasons. One, we want the DSPs to be successful and ramp on our platform. But more importantly we want to flow more dollars due to our publishers at a time when, frankly, because brand dollars are less in the economy and less than the eco stsytem, publisher yield has gone down, so we wanted to offset that by reinvesting back in our own MAX ecosystem. We don't talk about the scale of the DSP business really, but you get back into it in a way by understanding the short-term impact with what we sized MoPub originally, a couple of $100 million business that's now transitional coming over, would then be, let's call it, in a migration period, down a little bit and then have that and then divide by four to get to a quarterly impact. So call it somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thanks, Clark, for the question. We'll go next to Matt Cost with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Cost: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll piggyback on Clark's question about the ALX MoPub migration. So I just want to understand. So the publisher bonuses -- and please correct me if I'm wrong about this, the publisher bonuses last quarter were to get people to transition onto the combined MAX and MoPub platform that publishers have had inventory for sale. So now you're working to get DSPs that were previously bidding into that inventory to move over to MAX. I guess, if that's correct, what is holding them back from transitioning? I mean, if they were already bidding into that inventory what are they looking for in order to move over to the new platform? And have you noticed or observed that cutting the take rate has been enough to get them to start through that process. And then I have one follow-up.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Good question, Matt. So look, the publisher bonuses went to publishers, we don't yield dollars off the publishers. But once we get the supply that creates strength of the platform. That's given us the largest reach in mobile for that MAX audience platform. And then the DSPs will follow. And so we do have over 90% migrated now. But these DSPs, one have to go through the technical effort of reconnecting the pipes to a new exchange MoPub over to MAX. Secondarily, their models have to learn on new inventory. Data, let's call it, over the last 10 years, most of these DSPs were plugged into MoPub five-plus years. So they had tons of learning on the MoPub exchange that now has to port over to the MAX exchange for them to get their spend through the platform to increase the levels it was at. We're well on that way because MAX is a bigger platform but we paired that with just cutting the take rate. So that's just a short-term cut to the potential revenue. We're not bound to keep the dollars that we're pushing to publishers from the DSPs at the level that we decided to put it at. But our goal with MAX is to ensure that publishers have a consistent and strong business. And as we're looking at the macro trends that we're seeing, brand CPMs through the MAX platform have decayed in the entire digital landscape. And with that, publisher yield has gone down. So we felt like it was our responsibility to flow more dollars to the publisher, which helps them maintain a good standard at baseline in their business. And then as the economy improves and dollars flow back into the ecosystem, we can make whatever judgments we need to on the economics of these different revenue streams in our business.\nMatt Cost: Great. Thank you. And then just on the guidance for the software platform, is there a market growth assumption underlying that? And has that changed? Or how has that changed year-to-date?\nHerald Chen: Obviously, we're operating in a tougher overall environment. But as we said, we do control mostly our own destiny to our own technology. If we're able to improve our AXON engine, which has driven obviously extraordinary growth over the past year and actually now a few years. We think that's the key driver. So look, the summer months are slower. Third quarter will be probably similar to the second quarter, but we do see acceleration in the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but more importantly, due to our own efforts on our technology platforms.\nMatt Cost: Great. Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Okay, great. Thanks, Matt, for the question. We'll go next to Martin Yang at Oppenheimer. Please make sure you unmute your device first, Martin.\nMartin Yang: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Adam, can you address your strategic rationale for Unity's great side of the business, if you were in a role of the CEO, how would you think about creates synergy with the rest of the business with AppLovin's and its longer-term future?\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Martin. And obviously, we're really early stages here. We made a proposal. We'll be waiting for a response. And so we're not too deep into this type of analysis. But I will say just conceptually because I've known the Unity business the whole time we've been building this business. We have a lot of respect for the Create business. Frankly, it's one of the most complicated and impressive technologies in the technological world today. And it enables creators of all kinds to bring their content online in a 3D real-time manner. And the value of that to us and why we were excited about making this proposal is that we've built this complex and very powerful machine learning technology, AXON, and it does better, if it has more data. Create is the underlying technology in over -- in the majority of mobile games. So if you think about that, is the contextual data that Unity has access to is very compelling. We also reach a lot of the mobile games in the ecosystem through our technologies on MAX and AppDiscovery, but that combination could be very compelling. And that's why Create is important to us and why we see this path of being able to unlock a lot of synergies by the complementary nature of these two complicated technologies, which could unlock a lot.\nHerald Chen: I'd just add to that. Again, we're very early in that discussion. So far, it's been a one-way discussion. Create is definitely a different business model than how we've operated our business. But the beauty of the transactions Adam said, is the synergies we can get using our AXON technology with our Operate business, where we'd have tremendous free cash flow generation. And on the Create side, where they've invested very, very heavily in the business. It is a market leader. It is very, very difficult for anybody to chase them down now. And they are on the precipice of migrating over to being cash flow positive on that business. So our view in the medium and long term, that, that's a very, very unique software asset that's high growth and ultimately will also be contributing to free cash flow, which we're excited about.\nMartin Yang: Thank you. I have a follow-up with Herald. Can you maybe confirm that your $2 billion software platform target for '23 is still intact?\nHerald Chen: That's still our target. Obviously, with the headwinds of macro and the industry and some changes in privacy that becomes a higher target. But given our strategic position today, some of the new investments we've been making, acquisitions we've made, that remains our target -- internal target.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. I'll add to that. I think the important piece that we want our investors to understand about our business is we do control our own growth, and that's really truly improvements to the AXON technology. And you've seen that in the last four quarters where we had these sequential step-ups. Each one of those were enhancements to the technology to make it more accurate. This is a predictive technology, and the goal is to predict which ops users can to download and engage with. Every predictive technology that's built on top of a lot of data is going to have an error rate, and we have an error rate. Every time we can reduce that error rate, the accuracy of those predictions go up and the business will see a step function gain in revenue. So what we get excited about and why our teams work so hard is to look for those lifts. When we find one, it will increase the business and it won't be a slow increase. It will be a step function. So given time, we're going to find more of those lifts, more of these accuracy enhancements. And that will give us a lot of confidence in bigger numbers in this business given the scale that we're operating at today.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Martin, for the question. We'll go next to David Pang at Stifel. David, go ahead.\nDavid Pang: Great. Thanks. Can you hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Great, David.\nDavid Pang: So thanks for the question. Can you talk about the implications of Google joining MAX as a bidder? And as a follow-up, can you talk about just your thoughts on capital allocation in the midst of the Unity merger proposal?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, I'll talk to the first one, and Herald will talk about the second one. So on Google bidding, obviously, we announced that we're one of three mediation platforms they're externally bidding into for the first time ever. This is truly exciting for us. When we built MAX, our intent with it was to create an open, transparent and fair platform for a real-time auction. But a lot of the ad technologies in the industry weren't there yet. Now we've got a good amount of the market already bidding, but Google is the biggest company, and they were the big one to go tip into bidding to really make this initial goal that we have for the platform a reality, where we one day envision the entire market real-time bidding on our exchange and not being the best way to create efficiency for all constituents in the market, the publisher, the advertiser and the consumer. And so Google taking this step, we think, is giant. And they're still in the midst of testing. We're in a beta period with them on the platform. But as it ramps, of course, and we've disclosed our economics on MAX, our 5% of the dollars that flow through our ecosystem from a bidder, we take. So today, we're not generating any dollars or any material dollars, I should say, from Google into our platform. And the day that they can scale bidding, it will become a material revenue stream for our business, which we're excited about.\nHerald Chen: Yes, then with regard to capital allocation strategy, I think we remain the same as we've always been. We're focused on how do we create the best long-term shareholder value for all of our shareholders. So on a stand-alone basis, we've obviously been doing that through the acquisitions, through investing in our team and our development projects. We do believe specifically in the case of Unity, we really have a partnership with them, and that's what we offered essentially our combination is fairly equal, a little different on voting, a little different economics. But essentially as a partnership with them to go attack the market that we know extremely well and do it well together. They do have an amazing engine that's basically the operating system for the mobile gaming industry, where a large portion of it. That's also applicable outside the gaming industry, which is very interesting. That is a different business model that I just mentioned from the one that we've been pursuing with cash flow focused. On the other side, their operate business, combined with ours, it will be a very, very powerful business, and we're excited to go put our capital behind that. So we'd rather reserve our balance sheet cash, leverage capacity for investing in that combined business. Or as I said, on the stand-alone business as we've been doing in the past, we've been reinvesting when we find, if you will, the no-brainer acquisitions to do. We're certainly leaning in to go do those things.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thanks, David for the question. We'll go next to Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen, please go ahead.\nStephen Ju: Thank you. Can you hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes.\nStephen Ju: Alright, great. Hi, Adam and Herald. So I wanted to dig in a little bit on the inputs to the synergy calculation you lay it out earlier. So you talked about potentially a 20% lift to accuracy to generate an incremental $500 in net revenue. So -- but from the outside looking in, without an engineering or a data science background, it's hard for us and investors to kind of conceptualize how easy or difficult it will be to drive that accuracy lift. So can you talk about, from a practical perspective, what you need to do? So day zero, the merger has been consummated and you're sitting in the room with John. What are you doing first? And also, should we be thinking about potentially a materially better than 20% or 50% or even 100% lift to accuracy and what the potential could be? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, this is what gets us really, frankly, most excited about the opportunity. As you all know, the trajectory that our advertising business was on and the scale that it was at was so materially different than what AXON enabled us to get to over a very, very short time. Now I really like to unpack a little bit of what is AXON. So underlying our entire platform is a big data platform. This is what we built over the last decade. We ingest a ton of data from all sorts of data sources. And this comes into our platform and the AXON is the modeling on top. It's the math that says, I have a bunch of contextual data. I have engagement data on devices, how do I take that data and predict, which apps are users going to engage with so that I can show them a very relevant advertisement. That math is extremely complex. And the data platform, that underlying infrastructure and all the tools and reporting and everything that we've built over the last decade on top of it is also extremely complex. Then you've got Unity Operate. That's already a scaled advertising business. We know well. Obviously, we're in the market with their customers and MAX. But if you take those two businesses and allow them to tap into that same underlying data platform and allow them to tap into the same math and the same algorithms the unlock could potentially be huge. It's more scale, more customer reach, more data, all coming into the same place. It's proven to be very, very successful for us. And this is what we look for when we look for synergies and deals is where can we apply our machine learning and data technology expertise to be able to unlock more. So to your point of 20%, obviously, we don't know if it's going to be 20% or 50% or 100%. For us, it was over 500% in 7 quarters. So it had a huge impact. We put out there what we think is a conservative number because we know the power of our own technologies.\nHerald Chen: And maybe just taking it from two high-level perspectives. One, obviously, on their current transaction, they're discussing $300 million. We're obviously a much larger partner for them, a lot bigger business and a lot more overlap. So you could just think about the baseline at $300 million, probably it wasn't clear whether that's cost or revenue synergies. But talking about the cost side for a moment, just top down. Adam mentioned having a combined operate in our software platform business over $2.5 billion of revenue that would probably have a cost base of $1 billion to $1.5 billion of costs. And so apply any reasonable percentage of that, there's an opportunity to really get some efficiencies, let alone, obviously, all the normal back office corporate functions and two public companies considering coming together. So we do think the ability to achieve $700 million EBITDA synergy, a lot of work to be done. But given the lift we have on the revenue side and then on the cost side, we think that's achievable.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thanks, Stephen. We'll go next to Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Ralph, please go ahead.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First one just more short-term in nature on the take rate item. Just curious on the duration of that, kind of, how you're thinking about that? And are you seeing the sort of intended sort of benefits that you were looking for? And then I have a follow-up for Herald.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, like ultimately, this is us reinvesting into our own ecosystem, and we see it on a necessity right now because the brand dollars are really dried up in these digital markets today, while we've got the supply chain and macro issues. As that eases up as we go forward, we have a decision to make, keep the take rate where it is or expand it. That's something that's just a manual toggle in our system. What's more important for us is ensuring that the publishers on our system have a thriving business. So when we get there, we'll make the decision. But as the economy improves and as more dollars go back into the system, this part of our business, frankly, isn't the biggest driver of growth in our business. Our entire system is automated around return on ad spend goals for advertisers. So as you think about our AXON platform, again, advertisers plug in the goals and they want us to go achieve those goals. We have very little churn on our platform. We've got over 200% net dollar retention. So these advertisers are still spending, but the problem is that their ability to generate revenue on the other side of those dollars spent decreases in a bad economy because they have less brand dollars flowing it. So in a way we're offsetting that. And as the brand dollars come back into the ecosystem, our systems for the much bigger part of our business AppDiscovery automatically will increase bids, will increase yield to the advertiser and will increase scale of our platform. So we end up with two benefits when the economy turns the other way. And that's hopefully not going to take too much longer here.\nRalph Schackart: Great. And then, Herald, comment that on the Unity offer, it had been primarily sort of a one-way conversation. Sort of any color you could add to that? Are you in dialogue at all? Or anything you're comfortable sharing will be appreciated.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Ralph. No, we put in our proposal, and we're waiting to hear back.\nRalph Schackart: Okay. Thank you.\nRyan Gee: Thanks, Ralph, for the question. We'll go next to Youssef Squali at Truist Securities. Go ahead, Youssef.\nYoussef Squali: Excellent. Can you hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes.\nYoussef Squali: All right. So two quick ones for me. Herald, you said earlier something about your expectation that in 2023, you expect to grow the Apps business, top line and stabilized margins. Can you maybe just under the assumption that you still own that business by then, what gives you confidence in that considering the most recent quarter performance in the last couple of quarters? And then I guess on the Unity proposed offer. I guess at a high level, philosophically, how are you guys looking at voting control? And how important is that to you notice that you have that in there, 51-49? How important is that to consuming the transaction?\nHerald Chen: Yes, happy to take both of those, maybe ever worse. On the Unity voting structure, look, the reality is we want to be a partner of theirs. We think it's a very friendly non-binding, unsolicited offer. So we wanted to make sure they understood that. The reality is no one would really have a controlling stake in the combined business. And so we would have a diversified shareholder base, highly liquid and no one would really be in that control seat was really our goal there. And then the first question was -- remind me?\nYoussef Squali: Was it around the apps business?\nHerald Chen: Yes, yes. On the apps business side, look, we've had a change of leadership there. We have a completely different lens of how we're managing the portfolio. Adam and I are now digging quite deeply at each of the applications and studios themselves. And so -- and in some ways, we get to cherry pick what are we going to be left with coming into \u201823 and that we want to be a healthy business. Of course, if the market improves and someone could come in and pay us a very attractive price for that, as we said, it's non-strategic. And if that's the right financial return, we'll do that. Otherwise, we want to make sure we have a business that is healthy, that is growing and has industry-type margins, which is we think 15%, 20% at least on an EBITDA basis.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. I think the other point to add on the growth point is really like, we're not talking about exceptional growth, just industry growth. And when you think about the period that we are now and the period that we were for the last couple of years, there was a lot of overconsumption of games during COVID. People were spending dollars more than they typically would in games. People were consuming more content because frankly, they can't go anywhere. Now we're in a period of under consumption because people are just past COVID, everyone's traveling, suns out, and people are having fun in the site. We'll eventually get back to normal traffic patterns and mobile gaming is still the most accessible and most affordable form of entertainment. We started this business in 2012. So we've been on the front lines of seeing all the traffic patterns, all the trends in both the COVID period and today's period or anomalies. Once we get back to normal traffic patterns, we fully expect this to be a growth category. And our apps business now that we've had a couple of quarters where we've minimized, we've taken down user acquisition spend based on much more realistic ROA goals to what industry norms are. We're seeing revenues stabilize and then now we expect that business to just be a standard mobile gaming business, which will grow with the ecosystem.\nYoussef Squali: And just very, very quickly, was there -- back on the Unity proposed transaction. Did you guys have any discussions with them before the IAS deal was announced?\nAdam Foroughi: No. I mean, look, I can answer that without answering it too directly, because we've known Unity for a long time. I've known JR for years have a lot of respect for what he and the team have built over Unity with Create and Operate. And I hope they have mutual respect for what we've built over here. So in a way, like I can't answer that too clearly because over the past many years, we've had discussions well in the past. But what we're looking at today was a bid that we made really unsolicited. It was -- it can't -- we were really busy in Q1 with MoPub, right? And then we've seen a lot of growth in our own business. We're putting the pieces together. And of course, over the years, we'd assess the Unity business and been very really impressed with what they put together. And over the last couple of years, as we put our technology stack together we saw a lot of complementary pieces, but we didn't stop to think about the synergy math until they announce that ironSource deal, and we started doing the analysis. And then we just saw a need to put this bid out there because the math was so compelling to us that we felt putting a very thoughtful offer out there would be appropriate for both parties, companies, teams and shareholders.\nYoussef Squali: Got it. Thank you. Thank you, both.\nRyan Gee: Thank you, Youssef, for the question. We'll go next to Tim Nollen at Macquarie. Go ahead, Tim.\nTim Nollen: Thanks a lot. Hi, Adam. Hi, Herald. A couple of things. I want to follow-up on the last point, which was also a previous question. And I'm just wondering how much does the effort to sell the gaming app business factor into any decision that Unity might make? It sounds from previous comments like it might be something that would be very useful to them, to the combined company. But at the same time, you're going to the process of selling it. So I just wonder like how that would factor into any decision that Unity would make to actually go ahead with you?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Let's answer that one first. So look, like we can't address what other people's decisions would be on parts of our business. But we decided last quarter, it wasn't strategically critical to our Software business as our Software business has become so large scale. If we were able to put the two companies together, that Software business would be incredibly large scale. And truly, the parts, the components of that, that would be in focus would be AXON and Adjust and MAX and Create and Operate. These are Software businesses at their core. They don't need the mobile gaming side. And so we would still operate the business as a good business just like we would do independently. But I don't think the thought process around games changes materially in any way when the combined business would be one of the world's largest, fastest-growing, most cash flow-generative Software businesses.\nTim Nollen: Yes. Okay, I get it. Secondly, and separately, you mentioned privacy as an issue that's kind of weighing on things right now. You haven't really talked about privacy concerns being an issue before. I think like quarter or two or three ago, we were all worried about IDFA and what impact that would have on the business and it had little to none, I think. Are you just talking more on the game app side if that's playing down? Or can you just talk a bit more about what you mean by the privacy implications?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. To unpack that, it really has to do with privacy constricting growth opportunities in the whole sector. And when you take the IDFA away, you lower the capacity for mobile gaming companies to go target effectively on all channels. We're a contextual channel at its core so that it didn't have as much direct impact on our business. But we're now seeing the gaming category slowdown in growth. And of course, there's macro trends. But more specific to the gaming category is the IDFA was taken away. So we're four or five quarters in to advertisers, mobile gaming companies not being able to spend all of their money as efficiently as they used to be able to spend. And that eventually has effects on growth. And so we think that's one of the inputs into the fact that we're seeing lower game consumption today. We do think the bigger one is just this hangover post this COVID over consumption period that will reverse out that this privacy one is an issue. And frankly, it's one of the reasons why we were really compelled to make this bid for this merge with Unity, because the synergy math is so impactful on the ecosystem itself to be able to spend more dollars. If together, we were able to unlock these synergies and mobile gaming advertisers could spend billions of dollars more a year in a performance manner. Together, we'd actually be able to be a catalyst for growth in the ecosystem. Of course, on our own, we've been doing that with AXON as our business has grown really quickly and gotten to large scale. We're causing that TAM expansion too, to offset some of these losses from IDFA as shares come to our platform, but the ecosystem just needs more of that.\nTim Nollen: Okay, thanks.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Thanks, Tim, for the question. We'll take our last question from Franco Granda with D.A. Davidson. Franco, please go ahead.\nFranco Granda: Hi, thanks for [Technical Difficulty]\nAdam Foroughi: Hey we lost you Franco.\nFranco Granda: Can you hear me now?\nAdam Foroughi: Now you bet.\nFranco Granda: Okay. Awesome. Thanks for taking my question heer. Your software business is clearly doing very well. So well, in fact, that you're able to pass on some of the potential revenue to your customers and keep your outlook unchanged. And this is during a moment where the self attributing networks are seeing big headwinds. So can you speak to what is driving the performance of AppDiscovery? Is it simply improvements in recommendations? Or what are your thoughts there? And then secondly, Adam, you talked about the introduction of Array during the quarter. What potential customers will you be focusing on first? And what is that active outreach to clients due to your margins?\nAdam Foroughi: Okay. So maybe I'll answer the first one, and, Herald, will you take the second one. So on the first, really, our growth has come from a couple of things. And one, traditionally, we've always been a contextual data platform. We've never known the user. In fact, we don't need to know the users name, the user's background, the demographics of the user. These are not things that matter for our models. What we care about is mobile game engagement data off of the device. And so our models have always been built around that. Now we took this baseline of data, which definitely was inferior to a lot of the bigger platforms that have direct relationships with the consumer in an era of IDFA and prior to all these privacy changes much more personalized advertising to the person. And so now the advertising has shifted much more to the device. Then we paired our data with AXON. The math in our system just got better. And that system is really, really complicated. But when we put it together, we put our data platform and AXON together the right way. It made our system just much more accurate and getting more accurate drivers, more value to advertisers so they can put more dollars in. That's what's reflected in that net dollar revenue retention that we put up over 200% every one of the last five quarters. And really that's why we're thriving in this ecosystem today. And we expect that to carry forward. These are not advantages that we have that somehow are going to disappear. This is just what our business is built on because this is the only access to data that we've ever had since we started the company.\nHerald Chen: Yes, with your question regarding Array, we're super excited about it, but it's still very early. We've got a really good team, still a small nimble team then doing an AppLovin style, where we can move very, very quickly, build great product. It does leverage our existing ad tech capabilities, of course. And so I think you asked about the customer base, we'll go after the same OEMs and providers that are out there. There's only a certain number of those there. But we've already started really good dialogues with several key ones. We're helping them build product road map. They're helping us build hours. And so we hope it to be something more meaningful in terms of getting started from a revenue standpoint really in \u201823 and scaling up to something more meaningful '24, \u201825.\nFranco Granda: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nRyan Gee: Okay. It looks like that's all the questions we have for today. I'd like to turn it back to Adam or Herald for any closing remarks before we conclude the conference call.\nAdam Foroughi: Look, thanks, everyone, taking the time. I know it is an interesting period in our industry. We are excited about the stand-alone prospects about our business. We think we've built a stack -- a full-stack solution. That's super interesting. If we think we can integrate that as a partner into Unity, that would be a very interesting place to be as well a different path, but could be also very accretive to both sides of the shareholders. We did need to put a superior proposal in according to their contract, which we think our proposal is just that, in so many ways, strategically scale and then also just in terms of absolute price. So we'll keep everybody informed to the extent we can on that process. But in the meantime, we're certainly all heads down focused on our own business. So thanks for the time.\nRyan Gee: Thanks, everyone. That's it.\nHerald Chen: Thank you.",

            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Thank you all for joining us today. With our proposal this week, we were really hoping to spice things up at this earnings call. We'll come back to that in a bit. But now I want to start by saying that we are pleased with our performance during the second quarter. We delivered strong year-over-year growth led by our Software Platform business, which grew over 100% over the same period last year. Notably, we surpassed 500 Software Platform enterprise clients and our revenue from those clients and net dollar-based revenue retention also improved year-over-year. We're successfully driving adoption by onboarding new clients and deepening our relationships with the existing ones. I also want to acknowledge the challenging period for the mobile app ecosystem, which was facing a few headwinds going into the quarter and which were compounded by the weaker macro economy. We appreciate the near-term may be challenging so we are hyper focused on the one thing we can control best, continuing to improve our strong software platform technologies. I'm very proud of our team and all of our accomplishments. Let me highlight three of them. First, we successfully completed the shutdown of MoPub. Now that MoPub is fully integrated into MAX and their developers have moved over. We have been focused on strengthening our relationship with all the new partners in the quarter. MAX is on track to hit our goal of a $10 billion a year run rate of media transacted through our platform by the end of the year. MAX is the strongest platform for mobile in-app bidding. Next, we ramped our AppLovin Exchange continuing the migration of MoPub demand partners to our platform. Just as with the publisher integration of MoPub and the MAX, we are rebuilding 10 years of MoPub efforts in a very short amount of time. We want to facilitate success for these DSPs as they migrate and to give back to the publishers that use MAX in a tough economic time. So we reduced our take rate on AppLovin Exchange by nearly half. While we maintain flexibility on the economics of ALX long-term, in the short-term, we felt that this was the right thing to do for our marketplace. Additionally, we successfully integrated World and are already using AppLovin ad tech to start testing mobile gaming advertising campaigns on CTV. While this is still in the early stages of testing, the results are promising. And we're excited for World to bring a true performance-driven approach to advertising for the television market. This past quarter, we updated our strategic and financial approach to our apps business to focus on segment profitability and long-term cash flow growth. We have better aligned our level of investment across the portfolio to both current market conditions and future opportunities. For some studios, our plan may be to sell, close or restructure to maximize value. To increase margins, the most notable change in our approach was a reduction in user acquisition spend for our portfolio of apps as we increased our own desired return goals. The effect of this is that it reduces revenue, which is reflected in our guidance, but will lead to higher margins, much more in line with industry peers. We believe we're mostly through this period of readjustment of revenues and margins and the business will now be in a stable place, able to produce consistent cash flow. With that, let me turn it over to Herald to provide color on our numbers and outlook. Thanks, Herald. We'll be happy to answer as much as we can on the call, but I wanted to address some of the key points now. First, why now? Over the last decade, we've been an innovative company focused on building marketing and monetization solutions for app developers. At the same time, we've always had a lot of admiration for what Unity has built with their create and operate businesses. Our goals have always been very similar, helping grow the app economy by giving tools to creators to help them turn their ideas into growing businesses. In the past, internally, we've discussed the strategic rationale to bring the two companies together, but at the time, it didn't make sense for a few reasons. Up until a couple of years ago, our ad tech business was very similar to Unity operate. We were both successful in growing ad networks. But in the last two years, we launched our machine learning engine, AXON, which powers our ad network and helped it grow by over 500% since. We integrated MoPub into MAX creating the best in-app monetization platform for developers. And we added Adjust giving us one of the leading mobile attribution and analytics companies. In particular, because of the strength of AXON, we now see a path to unlocking very meaningful synergies by bringing the two companies together. When Unity announced their ironSource deal, we started analyzing these synergies, and we were excited by the possibilities as they could be over $700 million in just three years. We also weren't sure that Unity would be open to improving their technologies through a merger. Their ironSource bid made it clear that they now see the potential of a full stack solution, and given the synergies we assessed, we felt it necessary to put a thoughtful proposal out there of what our combined companies would look like. To be clear, we are confident in our standalone prospects. However, the combined business offers additional scale, data and reach, which if constructed correctly, would be accretive to the market and to all of our shareholders. So how did we arrive at over $700 million of synergies? Simple, it\u2019s based on the numbers and gains we see from our marketing and monetization solutions. In Q1 2021, our first full quarter with AXON, our Software revenue was $88 million. At the time, Unity operate reported $146 million revenue. This past quarter, our Software business reported $318 million of revenue compared to Unity operate reporting $158 million. The fast growth of our Software business allows us to apply the trend and get us really excited about what we could unlock together. AXON is extremely good at predicting which apps users will engage with MAX, but it can always be improved. We have two paths to this continued improvement: one, as we've touched on, our code improvements to lower error rates in our predictions; another and just as important is more access to data, which strengthens our algorithms. With the reach of Unity create, combined with the reach of our marketing and monetization solutions, the data sets of the two companies would be even more compelling. That incremental data should give us the potential to drive material lifts in our combined businesses. In 2023, separately, our Software business plus Unity's operate business would be projected to be over $2.5 billion in revenue. We believe just next year, the incremental data flowing into AXON would create material gains and it only takes 20% improvement to the accuracy of our algorithms to generate $500 million more revenue with nearly 100% flow-through. And what does this mean for the industry as a whole? This $500 million is net revenue. So if you gross it up to what advertisers would spend in round, you get $2 billion extra of performance spending in the combined platform just from synergies. Now remember, we sized the advertising market in mobile games for you at $25 billion in a prior shareholder letter. So the synergies alone would unlock 8% growth in the whole market. This would be a catalyst for growth in our market for years to come. Why did we make the proposal we did? Our proposal was constructed to best position the combined company to drive strong returns for AppLovin and Unity shareholders. We know the Unity Board would need to find our proposal superior to their current option on the table, and we believe we've done just that. While ironSource is a great business, the scale we operate at is just much greater. We believe our proposal offers both superior terms and a stronger partner in technology, scale, cash flow and strategic position. Importantly, we have AXON proven to be super impactful and the efficiencies that could unlock our immense. From a cash flow standpoint, our business alone will generate over $1 billion of EBITDA this year whereas our current combined plan contemplates reaching that in 2025. From a pure price standpoint, our proposal is at one-half the EBITDA multiple versus their existing deal. We strongly believe this is also good for AppLovin shareholders. We're very confident we can quickly unlock synergies and the longer-term strategic strength of the business would be very compelling creating the unquestionable leader in a growth category and a Software business with strong growth and cash flow prospects for as long as people will use mobile devices. This would benefit shareholders on both sides making ownership in the joint company really valuable. Now importantly, our personal decision around why I'm willing to take a backseat on the CEO role. My motivations of every step of our business were to build a bigger platform and truly innovate. I've never been motivated by power, equity or needing to be the face of an organization. I've been committed long term to what we've built here because this is my life's work, and I'm incredibly proud of everyone I work with here who continue to contribute to building great things. This combined company could potentially become a $100 billion enterprise, and that gets me really excited. John Ricantello is a strong leader and CEO for Unity, We've known each other for years, and I believe that together with our combined teams, there's a huge opportunity to capitalize on. COO means many things, but in this case, integration will be a key to unlocking the revenue and efficiency gains we would be asking our shareholders to believe in. I would owe it to you all to spend my time ensuring success there. So what's next? We are not going to speculate on the outcome of our proposal, but we feel strongly that we have put forth an offer the Unity's Board, its shareholders and our AppLovin shareholders should find compelling and be as excited about as we are. In the meantime, our team remains focused on the three strategic priorities we outlined in our shareholder letter, and we feel very strongly about our ability to continue to grow our business, whether we're successful on this proposal or not. We continue to see exceptional opportunities driven by improvements in our Software platform, and we are optimizing our business to improve our margin and our cash generation potential. We've been bold since we went public but really, we've been bold since we started this company. I have the passion and drive to lead an exceptional team to building a $100 billion company, and we will do that here with or without this deal. But we're definitely excited that this merger can accelerate both of our paths to that goal. Now happy to take your questions. Thanks, Clark. I'm going to reverse the answers. Second one, strategic opportunities in the future to expand our TAM and really our market potential. That really aligns with the new initiatives that we've talked about in the past. We're excited about our current market and our leadership position in it, but to expand to the scale that we aspire to get to, we've got to both expand our reach and the monetization potential for the developers that we have great relationships with. One of those new initiatives, CTV expands reach. It's all about tapping into a new audience on a fast-growing platform, and we're now live with the product there. It's just really early stage. But as I touched on in the script, we're seeing positive results already. And then we're also talking about and we released an announcement around Array. Array is now a marketing platform for carriers and OEMs to give them a life cycle native marketing solution to take -- to give them the capacity to deliver better advertising to their customers. We were sharing revenue with those carriers and OEMs and we think that can create a big expansion of reach as well. Then we talked about in the past, NFTs. We're still working on NFTs and blockchain as a new initiative. And really, the idea there is to get into payments. It's to allow our developers to create the transfer of ownership of a digital good to their customers and the transfer of ownership to be a transaction that would flow through our payment mechanism, our own blockchain. If we can execute on these new initiatives, we will be executing and expanding the TAM and giving ourselves a runway for many, many years of growth. Now that said, we have a lot of confidence in our current business. For multiple quarters now, we've had a lot of sequential growth in that business, and that came from AXON. The efficiencies we unlock by improving that technology made our ability to drive better results for advertisers. That's carried forward. The more improvements we make on AXON going forward, the bigger we're going to be able to expand the dollars of flow through our platform, and the bigger we'll be able to create an influence on TAM expansion in the market that we're in today. That creates upside in this business and the core opportunity we have going forward as well. I think, Clark, your other question was around MoPub DSPs. We did bring the MoPub DSPs. We're in the process of transitioning MoPub DSPs over to ALX at the moment. And that\u2019s an ongoing cases. Again, the focus was around publisher migration. Q2 and ongoing will be around getting DSPs onto our platform and ramp. We did make a short-term decision to cut take rate, as I touched on, by a little bit under half. And that was driven by two reasons. One, we want the DSPs to be successful and ramp on our platform. But more importantly we want to flow more dollars due to our publishers at a time when, frankly, because brand dollars are less in the economy and less than the eco stsytem, publisher yield has gone down, so we wanted to offset that by reinvesting back in our own MAX ecosystem. We don't talk about the scale of the DSP business really, but you get back into it in a way by understanding the short-term impact with what we sized MoPub originally, a couple of $100 million business that's now transitional coming over, would then be, let's call it, in a migration period, down a little bit and then have that and then divide by four to get to a quarterly impact. So call it somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million. Yes. Good question, Matt. So look, the publisher bonuses went to publishers, we don't yield dollars off the publishers. But once we get the supply that creates strength of the platform. That's given us the largest reach in mobile for that MAX audience platform. And then the DSPs will follow. And so we do have over 90% migrated now. But these DSPs, one have to go through the technical effort of reconnecting the pipes to a new exchange MoPub over to MAX. Secondarily, their models have to learn on new inventory. Data, let's call it, over the last 10 years, most of these DSPs were plugged into MoPub five-plus years. So they had tons of learning on the MoPub exchange that now has to port over to the MAX exchange for them to get their spend through the platform to increase the levels it was at. We're well on that way because MAX is a bigger platform but we paired that with just cutting the take rate. So that's just a short-term cut to the potential revenue. We're not bound to keep the dollars that we're pushing to publishers from the DSPs at the level that we decided to put it at. But our goal with MAX is to ensure that publishers have a consistent and strong business. And as we're looking at the macro trends that we're seeing, brand CPMs through the MAX platform have decayed in the entire digital landscape. And with that, publisher yield has gone down. So we felt like it was our responsibility to flow more dollars to the publisher, which helps them maintain a good standard at baseline in their business. And then as the economy improves and dollars flow back into the ecosystem, we can make whatever judgments we need to on the economics of these different revenue streams in our business. Thanks, Martin. And obviously, we're really early stages here. We made a proposal. We'll be waiting for a response. And so we're not too deep into this type of analysis. But I will say just conceptually because I've known the Unity business the whole time we've been building this business. We have a lot of respect for the Create business. Frankly, it's one of the most complicated and impressive technologies in the technological world today. And it enables creators of all kinds to bring their content online in a 3D real-time manner. And the value of that to us and why we were excited about making this proposal is that we've built this complex and very powerful machine learning technology, AXON, and it does better, if it has more data. Create is the underlying technology in over -- in the majority of mobile games. So if you think about that, is the contextual data that Unity has access to is very compelling. We also reach a lot of the mobile games in the ecosystem through our technologies on MAX and AppDiscovery, but that combination could be very compelling. And that's why Create is important to us and why we see this path of being able to unlock a lot of synergies by the complementary nature of these two complicated technologies, which could unlock a lot. Yes. I'll add to that. I think the important piece that we want our investors to understand about our business is we do control our own growth, and that's really truly improvements to the AXON technology. And you've seen that in the last four quarters where we had these sequential step-ups. Each one of those were enhancements to the technology to make it more accurate. This is a predictive technology, and the goal is to predict which ops users can to download and engage with. Every predictive technology that's built on top of a lot of data is going to have an error rate, and we have an error rate. Every time we can reduce that error rate, the accuracy of those predictions go up and the business will see a step function gain in revenue. So what we get excited about and why our teams work so hard is to look for those lifts. When we find one, it will increase the business and it won't be a slow increase. It will be a step function. So given time, we're going to find more of those lifts, more of these accuracy enhancements. And that will give us a lot of confidence in bigger numbers in this business given the scale that we're operating at today. Yes. Great, David. Yes, I'll talk to the first one, and Herald will talk about the second one. So on Google bidding, obviously, we announced that we're one of three mediation platforms they're externally bidding into for the first time ever. This is truly exciting for us. When we built MAX, our intent with it was to create an open, transparent and fair platform for a real-time auction. But a lot of the ad technologies in the industry weren't there yet. Now we've got a good amount of the market already bidding, but Google is the biggest company, and they were the big one to go tip into bidding to really make this initial goal that we have for the platform a reality, where we one day envision the entire market real-time bidding on our exchange and not being the best way to create efficiency for all constituents in the market, the publisher, the advertiser and the consumer. And so Google taking this step, we think, is giant. And they're still in the midst of testing. We're in a beta period with them on the platform. But as it ramps, of course, and we've disclosed our economics on MAX, our 5% of the dollars that flow through our ecosystem from a bidder, we take. So today, we're not generating any dollars or any material dollars, I should say, from Google into our platform. And the day that they can scale bidding, it will become a material revenue stream for our business, which we're excited about. Yes. Yes. I mean, look, this is what gets us really, frankly, most excited about the opportunity. As you all know, the trajectory that our advertising business was on and the scale that it was at was so materially different than what AXON enabled us to get to over a very, very short time. Now I really like to unpack a little bit of what is AXON. So underlying our entire platform is a big data platform. This is what we built over the last decade. We ingest a ton of data from all sorts of data sources. And this comes into our platform and the AXON is the modeling on top. It's the math that says, I have a bunch of contextual data. I have engagement data on devices, how do I take that data and predict, which apps are users going to engage with so that I can show them a very relevant advertisement. That math is extremely complex. And the data platform, that underlying infrastructure and all the tools and reporting and everything that we've built over the last decade on top of it is also extremely complex. Then you've got Unity Operate. That's already a scaled advertising business. We know well. Obviously, we're in the market with their customers and MAX. But if you take those two businesses and allow them to tap into that same underlying data platform and allow them to tap into the same math and the same algorithms the unlock could potentially be huge. It's more scale, more customer reach, more data, all coming into the same place. It's proven to be very, very successful for us. And this is what we look for when we look for synergies and deals is where can we apply our machine learning and data technology expertise to be able to unlock more. So to your point of 20%, obviously, we don't know if it's going to be 20% or 50% or 100%. For us, it was over 500% in 7 quarters. So it had a huge impact. We put out there what we think is a conservative number because we know the power of our own technologies. Yes. I mean, look, like ultimately, this is us reinvesting into our own ecosystem, and we see it on a necessity right now because the brand dollars are really dried up in these digital markets today, while we've got the supply chain and macro issues. As that eases up as we go forward, we have a decision to make, keep the take rate where it is or expand it. That's something that's just a manual toggle in our system. What's more important for us is ensuring that the publishers on our system have a thriving business. So when we get there, we'll make the decision. But as the economy improves and as more dollars go back into the system, this part of our business, frankly, isn't the biggest driver of growth in our business. Our entire system is automated around return on ad spend goals for advertisers. So as you think about our AXON platform, again, advertisers plug in the goals and they want us to go achieve those goals. We have very little churn on our platform. We've got over 200% net dollar retention. So these advertisers are still spending, but the problem is that their ability to generate revenue on the other side of those dollars spent decreases in a bad economy because they have less brand dollars flowing it. So in a way we're offsetting that. And as the brand dollars come back into the ecosystem, our systems for the much bigger part of our business AppDiscovery automatically will increase bids, will increase yield to the advertiser and will increase scale of our platform. So we end up with two benefits when the economy turns the other way. And that's hopefully not going to take too much longer here. Yes. Yes. I think the other point to add on the growth point is really like, we're not talking about exceptional growth, just industry growth. And when you think about the period that we are now and the period that we were for the last couple of years, there was a lot of overconsumption of games during COVID. People were spending dollars more than they typically would in games. People were consuming more content because frankly, they can't go anywhere. Now we're in a period of under consumption because people are just past COVID, everyone's traveling, suns out, and people are having fun in the site. We'll eventually get back to normal traffic patterns and mobile gaming is still the most accessible and most affordable form of entertainment. We started this business in 2012. So we've been on the front lines of seeing all the traffic patterns, all the trends in both the COVID period and today's period or anomalies. Once we get back to normal traffic patterns, we fully expect this to be a growth category. And our apps business now that we've had a couple of quarters where we've minimized, we've taken down user acquisition spend based on much more realistic ROA goals to what industry norms are. We're seeing revenues stabilize and then now we expect that business to just be a standard mobile gaming business, which will grow with the ecosystem. No. I mean, look, I can answer that without answering it too directly, because we've known Unity for a long time. I've known JR for years have a lot of respect for what he and the team have built over Unity with Create and Operate. And I hope they have mutual respect for what we've built over here. So in a way, like I can't answer that too clearly because over the past many years, we've had discussions well in the past. But what we're looking at today was a bid that we made really unsolicited. It was -- it can't -- we were really busy in Q1 with MoPub, right? And then we've seen a lot of growth in our own business. We're putting the pieces together. And of course, over the years, we'd assess the Unity business and been very really impressed with what they put together. And over the last couple of years, as we put our technology stack together we saw a lot of complementary pieces, but we didn't stop to think about the synergy math until they announce that ironSource deal, and we started doing the analysis. And then we just saw a need to put this bid out there because the math was so compelling to us that we felt putting a very thoughtful offer out there would be appropriate for both parties, companies, teams and shareholders. Yes. Let's answer that one first. So look, like we can't address what other people's decisions would be on parts of our business. But we decided last quarter, it wasn't strategically critical to our Software business as our Software business has become so large scale. If we were able to put the two companies together, that Software business would be incredibly large scale. And truly, the parts, the components of that, that would be in focus would be AXON and Adjust and MAX and Create and Operate. These are Software businesses at their core. They don't need the mobile gaming side. And so we would still operate the business as a good business just like we would do independently. But I don't think the thought process around games changes materially in any way when the combined business would be one of the world's largest, fastest-growing, most cash flow-generative Software businesses. Yes. To unpack that, it really has to do with privacy constricting growth opportunities in the whole sector. And when you take the IDFA away, you lower the capacity for mobile gaming companies to go target effectively on all channels. We're a contextual channel at its core so that it didn't have as much direct impact on our business. But we're now seeing the gaming category slowdown in growth. And of course, there's macro trends. But more specific to the gaming category is the IDFA was taken away. So we're four or five quarters in to advertisers, mobile gaming companies not being able to spend all of their money as efficiently as they used to be able to spend. And that eventually has effects on growth. And so we think that's one of the inputs into the fact that we're seeing lower game consumption today. We do think the bigger one is just this hangover post this COVID over consumption period that will reverse out that this privacy one is an issue. And frankly, it's one of the reasons why we were really compelled to make this bid for this merge with Unity, because the synergy math is so impactful on the ecosystem itself to be able to spend more dollars. If together, we were able to unlock these synergies and mobile gaming advertisers could spend billions of dollars more a year in a performance manner. Together, we'd actually be able to be a catalyst for growth in the ecosystem. Of course, on our own, we've been doing that with AXON as our business has grown really quickly and gotten to large scale. We're causing that TAM expansion too, to offset some of these losses from IDFA as shares come to our platform, but the ecosystem just needs more of that. Hey we lost you Franco. Now you bet. Okay. So maybe I'll answer the first one, and, Herald, will you take the second one. So on the first, really, our growth has come from a couple of things. And one, traditionally, we've always been a contextual data platform. We've never known the user. In fact, we don't need to know the users name, the user's background, the demographics of the user. These are not things that matter for our models. What we care about is mobile game engagement data off of the device. And so our models have always been built around that. Now we took this baseline of data, which definitely was inferior to a lot of the bigger platforms that have direct relationships with the consumer in an era of IDFA and prior to all these privacy changes much more personalized advertising to the person. And so now the advertising has shifted much more to the device. Then we paired our data with AXON. The math in our system just got better. And that system is really, really complicated. But when we put it together, we put our data platform and AXON together the right way. It made our system just much more accurate and getting more accurate drivers, more value to advertisers so they can put more dollars in. That's what's reflected in that net dollar revenue retention that we put up over 200% every one of the last five quarters. And really that's why we're thriving in this ecosystem today. And we expect that to carry forward. These are not advantages that we have that somehow are going to disappear. This is just what our business is built on because this is the only access to data that we've ever had since we started the company. Look, thanks, everyone, taking the time. I know it is an interesting period in our industry. We are excited about the stand-alone prospects about our business. We think we've built a stack -- a full-stack solution. That's super interesting. If we think we can integrate that as a partner into Unity, that would be a very interesting place to be as well a different path, but could be also very accretive to both sides of the shareholders. We did need to put a superior proposal in according to their contract, which we think our proposal is just that, in so many ways, strategically scale and then also just in terms of absolute price. So we'll keep everybody informed to the extent we can on that process. But in the meantime, we're certainly all heads down focused on our own business. So thanks for the time."

            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us today. We know you may not have had time to review our shareholder letter just yet, so I'll quickly hit some of the key points. As you already know, we are operating in a more challenging environment, notwithstanding though, given the focus and execution of our AppLovin teams around the globe, we are able to continue to grow our top line year-over-year to $776 million, which is a 16% increase led by our Software Platform business. That growth, plus improvements in cash flow from our apps business resulted in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 47% to $270 million. That equates to a 35% margin, which is the highest normalized EBITDA margin we posted since being public. We also introduced segment reporting this quarter, which allows us to provide you more information regarding the progress of our businesses. Starting with the Software Platform segment, we had $318 million of revenue, which was up 118% year-over-year. We continue to deliver highly performance solutions to our most important customers as evidenced by our record 503 enterprise customers with an increase in net dollar-based revenue retention of 204% on an LTM basis. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, all of our software solutions had some growth, except for ALX, which in the aggregate led to a quarterly decline of minus 3%. The ALX decline was due to a migration of DSP demand from Twitter's platform in Q1 to our ALX platform in Q2, which takes some time to ramp. And as Adam mentioned, we proactively reduced the take rate from DSPs to get pass more dollars along to our publishers. Importantly, from a cash flow standpoint, our Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 114% year-over-year to $197 million, representing a margin of 62%. While certainly a strong margin overall, in particular relative to our peers, during the quarter, we incurred step function increases and several costs. First, we have technology infrastructure costs that we discussed before, including additional data center capacity to support new publishers and demand partners onboarded from MoPub acquisition. And headcount costs, we're now including the team from World, our recently acquired Connected TV platform. For the second half of 2012, importantly, we do not foresee meaningful increases in the Software Platform cost. Therefore, we expect our software platform adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 65% and 70% for the year, consistent with our previous range. Regarding software revenue performance for the year, we have confidence we will deliver against our guidance. In the second and third quarter summer months are slower -- a slower part of the year for mobile gaming. But importantly, for our business, the primary driver of our software platform business growth is App Discovery, which is, of course, powered by AXON. The ability for us to more than double revenue over the past year and more than quintuple revenue over the past two years is largely driven by the continuous improvements in AXON. As we find improvements to our technology, we will realize meaningful increases in software revenue, which will flow through at very high margins. We do expect more of these improvements to occur over time, which supports our outlook for this year and beyond. Turning to the app side. As Adam described, our new approach to managing the portfolio is to focus on optimizing the business for financial return. Our efforts and progress are already evident in our second quarter numbers. Our apps adjusted EBITDA increased from $41 million in Q1 to $73 million. Margins expanded from 8% to 16%. Our bigger-than-expected reduction in spend, in particular in user acquisition impacts the top line in the near term, and therefore, we meaningfully reduced our apps revenue guidance by $300 million for the year. By 2023, our goal is to position the apps portfolio to have a healthy business model where we can grow the top line and earn a solid margin. Closing out on guidance, we did not make any other changes to guidance, including holding the midpoint of '22 EBITDA at $1.2 billion. We can do so given our high-margin Software Platform business and our ability to drive higher margins now in our apps portfolio. Overall, we remain highly confident in the stand-alone long-term value creation potential for our business given our top line prospects and cash generation potential. To that end, we were able to buy back approximately $340 million of our stock under our $750 million buyback program at an average price of $38 per share. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to turn it back to Adam to address the unique partnership proposal we made this week to the Unity Board. Obviously, we're operating in a tougher overall environment. But as we said, we do control mostly our own destiny to our own technology. If we're able to improve our AXON engine, which has driven obviously extraordinary growth over the past year and actually now a few years. We think that's the key driver. So look, the summer months are slower. Third quarter will be probably similar to the second quarter, but we do see acceleration in the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but more importantly, due to our own efforts on our technology platforms. I'd just add to that. Again, we're very early in that discussion. So far, it's been a one-way discussion. Create is definitely a different business model than how we've operated our business. But the beauty of the transactions Adam said, is the synergies we can get using our AXON technology with our Operate business, where we'd have tremendous free cash flow generation. And on the Create side, where they've invested very, very heavily in the business. It is a market leader. It is very, very difficult for anybody to chase them down now. And they are on the precipice of migrating over to being cash flow positive on that business. So our view in the medium and long term, that, that's a very, very unique software asset that's high growth and ultimately will also be contributing to free cash flow, which we're excited about. That's still our target. Obviously, with the headwinds of macro and the industry and some changes in privacy that becomes a higher target. But given our strategic position today, some of the new investments we've been making, acquisitions we've made, that remains our target -- internal target. Yes, then with regard to capital allocation strategy, I think we remain the same as we've always been. We're focused on how do we create the best long-term shareholder value for all of our shareholders. So on a stand-alone basis, we've obviously been doing that through the acquisitions, through investing in our team and our development projects. We do believe specifically in the case of Unity, we really have a partnership with them, and that's what we offered essentially our combination is fairly equal, a little different on voting, a little different economics. But essentially as a partnership with them to go attack the market that we know extremely well and do it well together. They do have an amazing engine that's basically the operating system for the mobile gaming industry, where a large portion of it. That's also applicable outside the gaming industry, which is very interesting. That is a different business model that I just mentioned from the one that we've been pursuing with cash flow focused. On the other side, their operate business, combined with ours, it will be a very, very powerful business, and we're excited to go put our capital behind that. So we'd rather reserve our balance sheet cash, leverage capacity for investing in that combined business. Or as I said, on the stand-alone business as we've been doing in the past, we've been reinvesting when we find, if you will, the no-brainer acquisitions to do. We're certainly leaning in to go do those things. And maybe just taking it from two high-level perspectives. One, obviously, on their current transaction, they're discussing $300 million. We're obviously a much larger partner for them, a lot bigger business and a lot more overlap. So you could just think about the baseline at $300 million, probably it wasn't clear whether that's cost or revenue synergies. But talking about the cost side for a moment, just top down. Adam mentioned having a combined operate in our software platform business over $2.5 billion of revenue that would probably have a cost base of $1 billion to $1.5 billion of costs. And so apply any reasonable percentage of that, there's an opportunity to really get some efficiencies, let alone, obviously, all the normal back office corporate functions and two public companies considering coming together. So we do think the ability to achieve $700 million EBITDA synergy, a lot of work to be done. But given the lift we have on the revenue side and then on the cost side, we think that's achievable. Thanks, Ralph. No, we put in our proposal, and we're waiting to hear back. Yes, happy to take both of those, maybe ever worse. On the Unity voting structure, look, the reality is we want to be a partner of theirs. We think it's a very friendly non-binding, unsolicited offer. So we wanted to make sure they understood that. The reality is no one would really have a controlling stake in the combined business. And so we would have a diversified shareholder base, highly liquid and no one would really be in that control seat was really our goal there. And then the first question was -- remind me? Yes, yes. On the apps business side, look, we've had a change of leadership there. We have a completely different lens of how we're managing the portfolio. Adam and I are now digging quite deeply at each of the applications and studios themselves. And so -- and in some ways, we get to cherry pick what are we going to be left with coming into \u201823 and that we want to be a healthy business. Of course, if the market improves and someone could come in and pay us a very attractive price for that, as we said, it's non-strategic. And if that's the right financial return, we'll do that. Otherwise, we want to make sure we have a business that is healthy, that is growing and has industry-type margins, which is we think 15%, 20% at least on an EBITDA basis. Yes, with your question regarding Array, we're super excited about it, but it's still very early. We've got a really good team, still a small nimble team then doing an AppLovin style, where we can move very, very quickly, build great product. It does leverage our existing ad tech capabilities, of course. And so I think you asked about the customer base, we'll go after the same OEMs and providers that are out there. There's only a certain number of those there. But we've already started really good dialogues with several key ones. We're helping them build product road map. They're helping us build hours. And so we hope it to be something more meaningful in terms of getting started from a revenue standpoint really in \u201823 and scaling up to something more meaningful '24, \u201825. Thank you."

        "content": "Ryan Gee: Good afternoon, everyone. Let\u2019s get stated. Welcome to AppLovin's earnings call for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. I\u2019m Ryan Gee, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance at AppLovin. And joining me today to discuss our results are our Co-Founder, CEO, and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi; and our President, Chief Financial Officer, Herald Chen. Please note our SEC filings, earnings release and shareholder letter discussing our first quarter performance are available at investors.applovin.com. We also posted a short slide presentation that Herald will reference later in this call, if you\u2019d like to follow along. During today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. These statements are based on assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them except as required by law. Actual results may differ materially from those results predicted. Please review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q to be filed shortly after this call for additional information. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter available on our IR website. Please be sure to review the GAAP measures and a reconciliations as non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available shortly. And we will be hosting a Q&A session after our prepared. But first I'd like to turn it over to Adam and Herald. Adam, please go ahead.\nAdam Foroughi: This past quarter we achieved many key milestones for AppLovin. We celebrated our 10 year anniversary in the business or one year anniversary as a public company. And we cleared over 10 billion app installs just covered through our marketing platform. We can celebrate this milestone because of the hard work and value and culture that we have in AppLovin. First, we hire and work with great people from diverse backgrounds. We give them an environment to thrive in, always trying to ensure each person has room to develop their professional and personal skills here more than anywhere else. Second, we are an entrepreneurial and we never sell. We know that in a competitive and challenging market complacency leads to failure. And third, we maintain focus, we aim to do big things. But all of our decisions are tied to our core goals continuing to expand our footprint as a marketing and monetization platform for developers. It was key to the team that we maintain these core principles as we entered a new public chapter for our company. I'm very proud to say we've done just that. [Indiscernible] demonstrated in our first quarter. Further our software platform business will continue to expand by adding new clients and increasing the amounts that existing clients are spending. The strong performance allowed to record EBITDA in Q1 of $276 million. Most software businesses lose money while growing. We're growing quickly and just clear to the $1 billion EBITDA run rate. Next, we successfully completed migrating MoPub into our MAX platform, unifying the two wireless mediation solutions in the mobile app market, we not only had to execute quickly on our side to accomplish this, we also ask publishers to integrate our platform into their app in just 90 days or risk losing their ad revenue. A couple things to call out specifically here. Historically we grew MAX to become the leading solution in the market by offering the best technology, not by paying bonuses. This is exactly how it will run our business going forward, focusing on continuing to deliver the best solution in the market. Given the short window of time to move toward a unified platform, we made the decision to payout $210 million in onetime publisher bonuses. We count into these bonuses as contra revenue. And Herald will give you the accounting details shortly. We see the opportunity to own the largest marketplace in app advertising ecosystem is strategically valuable long term. And therefore this was a decision that was an easy one to make because it helps ensure continuity with the publishers coming over from MOBA. Pushing monetization platform to the big undertaking, and we are proud that over 90% of the most of our publishers moved over to MAX. As a result, we now have a significant share in the market using our solution so much so that the success of our platform will directly influence growth in the total addressable market and success to all major parties in the ecosystem. That's a strong position to be in and a responsibility we will be proud of them. And finally, we acquired Wurl, a leader empowering streaming TV. Together, we will partner to great performance marketing the CTV. It is cleared just how quickly we push forward on items to make the biggest impact to our business when we look back just one year to the IPO and see that software was only 14% of our revenue versus 40% now. At that time, we discussed just how important the first party data that those games provided was to our software platform success. Today our software platform businesses are growing at a significant rate much faster than we expected. While there hasn't been [Indiscernible] leveled off. In fact, our software business in Q1 \u201822 is four times larger than it was in Q1 \u201821. And in Q1, software contributed over 80% of our EBITDA. For the last several quarters, we talked about how the app business is not as strategic as One Plus, with the continued scaling of our software platform, we proven that the two businesses can operate independently from one another. More directly, given the success of our software platform, we will no longer run our game as a cost center. That means we will be exploring how to structure our app business so that it is run more efficiently as its owned standalone business unit. This exploration may result in operational changes and possibly make the seller spin off from the studios. Among them are nearly 20 very [Indiscernible] gaming videos their founders and their team. We will operate the studios with a more profitable spend on user acquisition, which we already started to do in late Q1. Traditionally, we were willing to spend more on new users valuing the scale, audiences\u2019 data as a justification. This was operating it around breakeven while typically gaming companies operate at 20% or higher EBITDA margins, which we will now aim to reach over time. Mobile AppDiscovery discovery and monetization are critical for app developers now more than ever, with MAX we are the marketing leading monetization solution. AppDiscovery is the fastest early user acquisition channel for developers today, with customers paying us for performance were shielded against macroeconomic volatility. We have a powerful machine learning engine that is only 18-month old and will continue to improve. MAX allows us to serve ads to the 700 million daily active users we help monetize. We have been seasoned and navigating in complex ecosystem in a dynamic privacy landscape. With the growth opportunities across our software business and feature initiatives and the highest cash flow of our business generates even today, we're very excited about our future. Now I'll turn it over to Herald Chen to outline the details of Q1 financials and our outlook.\nHerald Chen: Thanks very much. As Adam mentioned, with the growth environment for our software platform, plus a new operating approach for our apps portfolio, we're excited about our near and long term growth prospects and cash flow outlook. Don't you better understand that thesis going forward, we'll be providing greater insights to the economic drivers of our two businesses. And regarding the overall cash generation of our company, for a quick preview what Adam just described in more detail shortly. Our guidance for the software platform business is to generate over $1 billion of revenue in a second through fourth quarter this year. Based on an estimated margin for that business was 70% and a flow through the cash of another estimated 70% that business alone will generate over $0.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow in the next three quarters alone. Now let's get back to the quarter and it\u2019s in the Q1 we make some key decisions and good progress to our goals. I'll highlight a few in detail before we take your questions. The first topic is our overall strong spending in margins. We have strong quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth on both the top and bottom line when adjusting for the $210 million of contra revenue we booked in Q1 which were the bonuses paid to publishers related to the MoPub transaction. Our burst in Q1 was driven by the growth in our software platform revenue more than making up for a modest decline in our app revenue. But let me spend a few minutes on the contra revenue so you can appreciate the growth and margin expansion that we saw in the quarter. First of all, just the accounting of contra revenue. We pay these publisher bonuses to our vendors that are currently or may become future customer of ours. And since GAAP requires offsetting revenue for fees you pay to customers or potential customers, these publisher migration bonuses have $210 million are accounted for as contra revenue. Second, these are non-recurring and a result from the MoPub transaction. Historically, we did not incur these fees in any significant size. But when you shut down one of the largest players in mediation and ask their publishers to move over in 90 days, those publishers incur real revenue loss and cost to migrate. Going forward we deny these publisher bonuses as a significant cost to our normal business and we did not have them before MoPub nor we project anything significant going forward. Because the MoPub related fees are non-recurring, we add it back to adjusted EBITDA and any non MoPub related publisher bonuses as we would see after Q1 we will not be adding back to adjusted EBITDA, so therefore, it is just a onetime occurrence in this quarter, in this past quarter. For reporting purposes, on the revenue side, we cannot add back the contra revenue. But for internal purposes, of course, we combined the two numbers, which adds up to around 38% greater than ourQ4 number. Overall, we continue to return $210 million of contra revenue as part of our $1.05 billion purchase rights for MoPub, the total price for that edition was 1.26 grand. And that's a very attractive price for such a strategic and financially accretive asset. On a cash flow side, Adam mentioned, we had good record of $276 million in EBITDA with a reported margin of 44%. When normalizing revenue for the publisher bonuses, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which you can see in purple here that we think is the normal run rate of the business. And that is a 500 basis point increase over 28% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This margin expansion was entirely driven by the strong growth of our high margin software business. And in fact, the margin was slightly reduced by our assets where the reduction in apps revenue was in large are offset by user acquisition spending, but was still related to our overall margin. As we mentioned in shareholder letter, we currently got to make our software platform business currently runs at a normalized EBITDA margin of 65% to 70%. And our apps business at an estimated EBITDA margin of 5% to 10%. Therefore faster growth of software related apps tries margin expansion. We will be providing more details on this in our Q2 earnings report where we will be providing segmented financials for the first time. Our strong [Indiscernible] for software platform revenue and margin plus operating costs management allows us to raise our EBITDA guidance for this year and we'll talk about further in a minute. Of note at our current operating scale, we're able to translate a significant percentage of our EBITDA to unlevered free cash flow given our low CapEx, working capital requirements and moderate tax rate. We estimate that normalized run rate percentage of adjusted EBITDA translating to unlevered free cash flow to around 65% and 75%. The next slide we want to show you or talk about our software expansion for the quarter. So we\u2019ve heard now a few times from Adam and me we believe that software platform growth is key for our long-term growth and cash flow. So let's take a deeper look at our Q1 software performance. First of all, as noted in purple, you can see all of the onetime contra revenue is taken against our software revenue. But when added to GAAP revenue of $119 million, the total is $329 million for Q1 that represents 33% quarter-over-quarter growth rate on top of strong third quarter growth over our prior three quarters. We saw strong customer adoption across all of our solutions including AppDiscovery, AppLovin Exchange, Adjust and MAX. As we started to pick up revenue from the integrated MoPub customers. Our customers continue to find success with our solutions are growing their business and in turn spending more on us. Of note in Q1, we received approximately $40 million of revenue from both our Twitter and expect the revenue from the acquisition to grow over the course of the year. However, going forward, it will be difficult to discern what revenue comes explicitly from MoPub now that it is fully integrated into MAX. Across the board on software KPIs, we had a very solid performance normalized for the contra revenue impact. We have 258% net dollar based revenue retention in the quarter over prior year showing the resiliency of our customers and continued increase in the use of our software solutions. We also had a solid increase in the number of new customers. Our normalized SPEC count reached 519, an increase over 58 customers, but we still believe that a small percentage of customers available to us in the marketplace. The additions were across the business including from new additions from customers migrating from MoPub as well as for new customers from AppDiscovery and Adjust. On top of the more customers we saw the average revenue increase on average from all of our SPECs reaching normalized $603,000, a steady increase over the past three quarters. Of note, when we are taking the $210 million of contra revenue out of this metrics, we still were able to grow net dollar base retention and the total number of SPECs. For the third topic, we wanted to provide you an update on our guidance where we're increasing our \u201922 adjusted EBITDA target. For \u201922, our operating outlook for the software platform remains the same as previously given. However, we're adjusting our formal guidance by the $210 million in contra revenue to GAAP revenue guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.29 billion. We're continuing to expect $2 billion in software platform revenue in 2023, which will be a 10x increase from 2020 and a 65% increase over the midpoint of a revised software platform guidance in \u201822. We believe we have the market solutions technology and team to reach that goal. Further, given our scalable cost structure, which we articulated earlier, we believe that cash flow from a $2 billion revenue software business would be substantial. Switching to the app side investment, as Adam mentioned, our software platform and immense feature of MAX solution means we are much less reliant on the data from our apps to drive financial performance for our clients. Therefore, we're planning to manage that business to optimize for operating and financial efficiency, with a perspective on how to best drive cash flow from that business over the long term. In the near and medium term, that may include lowering our investment and user acquisition will drive up -- which will drive up margins for lower overall growth. We will also do a review of our app portfolio which could lead to a wide array of transactions or no change at all. Based on this new approach, we're lowering our revenue guidance by $200 million. And now targeting a range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion in revenue from apps in \u201822. The combination of our changes in software and app guidance leads to our revised total guidance of $3.14 billion to $3.44 billion on a GAAP basis. With regard to adjusted EBITDA, given a record performance and strong margins, we're raising adjusted EBITDA guidance to midpoint target of $1.2 billion. This target again represents a 65% increase over the prior year. This is also an increase from our previous guidance of high 20% margin against the total revenue forecast at midpoint for $3.7 billion, which equated to just over $1 billion. Key drivers in the same region EBITDA guidance for the much higher growth for our software platform business, which as I said, has a much higher margin profile. We have lower investment requirements than originally earmarked for new initiatives. And we now have a higher margin expected from our apps business as we optimize it. From an overall margin perspective, this equates with 36% \u201822 adjusted EBITDA margin at midpoint of GAAP revenue guidance, and a 34% of adjusted EBITDA margin when excluding the contra revenue. Therefore, the 34% target is our runway margin to focus on which would be an 800 basis point increase over the prior year. Since we do generate a good amount of cash flow, I wanted to touch briefly on our go for capital allocation perspectives. Previously stated we're not focused on M&A for the apps parts of the business, we will -- and we'll opportunistically look on the software side. Although there too we've assembled many of the key assets we wanted to look at 18-months. Then with regard to the stock buyback side, we do have our $750 million authorized program, and we use just over $45 million thus far. We are planning to use that authorization when appropriate and are open to doing so given the right opportunity. We appreciate the public markets are highly volatile and difficult to predict. In these markets, we believe cash is king and cash flow growth is king and queen. That's exactly where our team is focused. We believe in our strategic position growth and cash generation potential. And we will work hard at quarter after quarter to post the numbers that will earn your trust. Thank you for taking the time to get an update on our business. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Ryan?\nA - Ryan Gee: Yousuf. Please make sure that you do select unmute to ask your question. Go ahead, Yousuf.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. Can you hear me? Beautiful. Thank you. Hey, guys. So just a couple of questions for me, maybe just at a high level. How long do you think this review of the apps business will last? In the meantime, what kind of performance do you expect from it? I think it was down $40 million sequentially. That's one and then to a question we often get from investors is round just this shift in strategy away from the apps historically you guys have positioned yourself as strategically leveraging the apps to as a source of first party data or 1P. So maybe just refresh us, why is that not as important anymore? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Hey, Yousuf. I think the two questions are well tied together. And really what we're focused on with the games business, as it is today, is operated efficiently. We've got 20 or so studios, distributed all over the world, some are run very well, they generate good amount of profitability, some are generating losses. And we're going to go through the portfolio and ensure that every single one of them is held to the standards the same way any independent gaming company would be. And what gives us confidence in that is that our software business is frankly grown so much faster, and so much larger than what we thought when we first went public a year ago, we were talking about $650 million of revenue in software for the entire year this year. And we're now talking about over double that amount, around half that amount in the first quarter is quadrupled in the last four months. And so when we see that scale, what we know is that we have really become a market solution. And we've gotten a lot more software platform enterprise clients to come use our platform, we've gotten a lot more scale with the MAX and MoPub marketplace now. And that gives us the confidence that our games are only a small percentage of that software business. The other data points it's really important to point you out too is for four quarters in a row our games business has been fairly flat in both audience and revenue, whereas our software business has grown immensely. That gives us a lot of confidence in the trajectory of the software business. And we want to focus entirely on running that and achieving a couple of billion that we put out as a goal next year.\nRyan Gee: Next up is Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan : Okay, can you guys hear me now? Great. Hope everyone's well on the team. I want to come back to some of the acquisitions you've done and talk more broadly there. You finished MoPub obviously, there's Connected-TV with world. Where do you see now the collection of assets you have in terms of positioning yourself for compounded growth, different verticals on the advertiser side, potential budget unlock, not only in 2022 but as we look beyond 2022 over the next couple of years. I'd love to get as much color as we can about that. Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Great question. In mobile, we're really confident with our position, we've got the largest marketplace, we've got act on machine learning technology that's only 18-month old, and it's going to continue to improve. That's how these things go. And then we know performance model. So we're not looking to take advice from others, we are looking to give our advertisers results that are measurable and within their financial goals. That unlocked unlimited budget. And so as we think about how to increase our market over time, and create growth factors for many years to come, we really think about finding the consumers that we know how to serve as well with recommended offerings across other access points, and that\u2019s what may be Connected-TV interesting for us, we're all being one of the leading software solutions to bring content online and Connected-TV for a lot of the brands that have content needed distributed through a channel, we advertise in that content will have immense reach, be very valuable under full train. And we think it present a really large performance model on television. And we're going to focus on continuing expanding the software business and putting our machine learning software in as many places as we can go.\nRyan Gee: We'll go to Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Hi, great. Thanks. Can you hear me? Awesome. All right, great. So, Adam, reading between the lines of your shareholder letter seems like now's the time to go after the larger ad market, as opposed to just a spin from the mobile game sector. So with MoPub now in the house, is there any sort of direction or update you can give us in terms of the mix of ad revenue now coming from non-gaming clients and what the relative growth between gaming versus non-gaming is now and where that could be? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: So MoPub and MAX together is on top of 700 million daily active users around the world, and these consumers in large part on our platform, they're playing games, but I can assure you they don't just play games, the only thing they do in their life, so they're very good audience that level of scale to monetize on both games and non-games, we traditionally focus our solutions for the game developer and really built a lot of performance technology there, MoPub products access to the MoPub marketplace. And that's how they monetize their eyeballs. And the marketplace itself is directly access for companies like the Trade Desk, which we announced a partnership with last court to buy into our exchange. So as we continue to integrate, and push forward after this month of transaction, those types of relationships we're going to see more and more monetization potential is very large audience from non-gaming customers to augment the credit and market leading solution, we have at mobile gaming category.\nRyan Gee: Next, we'll go to Clark Lampen at BTIG.\nClark Lampen: Okay, can you guys hear me? Awesome. Maybe I'll follow up on Stevens question there for a moment. Because, Adam, you mentioned the Trade Desk onboarding. In prior quarters, we've seen in the shareholder letter that there's really been a spike in sort of customers coming on platform. So with ALX and MAX now kind of under the AppLovin umbrella for the first full quarter, could you give us a sense of customer response to the unified platform or maybe if it's possible, if there's any sort of backlog or just sort of qualitative read on demand. And then Herald, I think, if I understood this, right, as we look at the \u201922 EBITDA guidance, most of the adjustment years really sort of change a plan around apps and maybe it's asset adjustments. But given what you've talked about with strategy, does this change your sort of willingness to move potentially into new spaces, like, OEM, sort of block chain and NFT's and some of the things you talked about last quarter? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, so as we think about like the integration that we just did, we put together the largest really open marketplace and mobile apps is average of just over 700 million daily active users in one exchange is a very large amount. So we've heard really positive feedback from the customers coming over. They were traditional DSP buying on MoPub, thinking that MoPub was the biggest solution. And by coming into this unified solution, they're getting over two times the amount of scale for their business, that's obviously made the reception really strong. And on the publisher side, it's being able to have that much scale in one software solution does creates a lot more liquidity, our entire objective with MAX was to drive up competition in the marketplace, so that we can increase the amount of money that the publisher earns, and know that on the other hand, that publisher is going to go invest in user acquisition. And that's what you're seeing really fuel our growth, you're seeing the increase in size where we've almost tripled them in the last 12- month. You're seeing that net dollar retention. I mean, I think it was around 265%, just this past quarter. These are the same customers a year ago, spending nearly tripled on our platform today. And that's because the efficiencies that we're bringing to the market is enabling them to do that and grow their businesses faster than the markets growth.\nHerald Chen: And Clark, thanks for the question. The other question you had was around margins and invest in a new initiative. I think last year, we talked about being the highest 20 so margins this year, and there are three big investments we needed to make. One was the infrastructure to grow the software platform as fast as if you are going to particular given MoPub. The second was the investment in new initiatives. And we put bucket aside, not knowing exactly what that would look like. And then the third one was realized new apps with studios, we on boarded to go invest behind that. I think very simply the first one we're still doing it or actually have done that's in place. We're on board due to the vast majority of what we wanted to do on MoPub and because of that infrastructure in place, and now we'll get to continue to grow as MoPub and the software platform that does grow. I think the other big pieces, do you have changes to them. On the new initiatives side, we're pursuing the NFT block chain as well as the OEM strategies, and I'll touch on that in a second. We're still as bullish as we were in the first quarter of out there that we just don't think it takes as much dollars this year is investing behind it to go to achieve that. And then we talked about the app side, which is a very different approach in terms of the investment there. We told you before that the M&A dollars would not be allocated there. And now we're telling you that importantly though we're running at low single digit margins, and they really should be in their 20s margins. And so there's a lot of room for us to improve that from an OpEx standpoint. So we're -- we still remain extremely excited about the new initiatives. We talked about UCTV with world being one OEM another and then the NFT block chain and we would expect in the next couple of 12-month, if not sooner be coming back to you to describe some of the progress we're making on all these fronts.\nRyan Gee: We'll go next to Matt Cost at Morgan Stanley.\nMatt Cost: Hey, everyone, thanks for taking the question. I guess just looking at the ad network revenue in the quarter, very strong, it looks like revenue perspective, I have this right within as an all-time high. So I guess what are the sources of strength in 1Q, particularly while you're going through the transition of MoPub into MAX that you would call out? And within that could you talk to the contribution from MoPub in the quarter? And then just Secondly, kind of more philosophically, I guess, historically, the way that I certainly thought about what made your ad network unique was that you had a flywheel between the data that came from the apps business, and then you said, the algorithms in the ad network. So I guess in the future where the apps could be spun or sold at the very least smaller in scale relative to the scale of the ad network. What differentiates AppLovin\u2019s ad network now, as you sort of drive to the next leg of growth, if it's not just running the same playbook that got you from where you started to where you are? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, great question. And when I look at, it really, it's all interrelated. Again, if you look at our ad business, the inflection point on it was the release of AXON 18 months ago, and the continued expansion of dollars that are invested by our own customers over the last year is coming from the efficiencies in the machine learning, these systems just get better as they get more data. Now, what's interesting about that your data question is that when we started it was the AXON, the only data we had were on games does the entire region we got into games. And when we went public a year ago, our own games made up 35% or 40%, of the software business. And we reported that to you in [Indiscernible]. Now that number continues to shrink. And that's because we've been seeing immense adoption of the technology, we're seeing customers come online, we're serving more ads, we're getting a bigger feedback loop from doing all of those things. And we're seeing the machine learning continue to improve without a necessity for our own games to be feeling the data. And that's what gives us the confidence to go, let's just run both these businesses the most efficiently that'll maximize shareholder value, and allow us to continue to grow the software business to generate actual real margin from the games business at the same time.\nMatt Cost: Thanks, then, just on the ad network side, if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, I think you asked the contribution was from MoPub in the quarter and it was just over $40 million, specifically. And we can -- we know that number, because Twitter was still running that business for us in the quarter, subsequently valued integrated entirely in the MAX, MoPub as everyone knows, was completely shut down March 31 of this year, and so it's fully integrated in our numbers rolling forwards, we won't be able to parse it out, because all the data and the consumer customers are all integrated. But we expect to increase that number quarter-over-quarter, as we've shown ultimately, in our software guide for the year.\nRyan Gee: We go next to David at JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you, just one on MoPub integration. I know it's early. But for the publishers that have migrated over, can you maybe say how much traction you're seeing and pushing these kinds toward in updating? And then how do you think about cross-selling from these new relationships in your AppDiscovery products or anything else you offer? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, the MAX solution itself, really, we built and push the markets and I think and up and partnership with Facebook really were the first two big bidders in the marketplace. And clients are coming over to MAX's yet we're not bidding out of the box, what we have seen is strong performance for the publishers that have come over. And frankly, just because of the scale, we've got some liquidity on the platform. It allows us to get more differentiated demand, and the technology was built much later than the other mediation solutions. And that's why we've had such a strong trajectory to Max before MoPub and why we continue to expect it to be the leading solution in the marketplace.\nRyan Gee: We'll go next to Tim Nollen at Macquarie.\nTim Nollen: Okay, great, thanks. I've got a couple of questions related to the contra revenue because I guess I had thought of the $200 million as number that you've mentioned before as being more of a cost. If it's a contra revenue item just to make sure that is not just MoPub customer revenue that's being shifted over to MAX, but there must be some other revenue in your system that's also being moved over to MAX, just want to make sure I understand that because the $40 million versus the $210 million number, just to make sure I understand what that difference is. And then relatedly, if you've got 90%, I think you said of customers moved over to MAX, does that mean most of this is behind you and the other 10% are going to come? Or what happens to that other 10%? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, thanks, Tim, for the questions. Yes, sorry, this would require clarifications, on the revenue side that we take to our software business, specifically coming out of MoPub customers with the $40 million, the $210 million we are referring to is the fees that we paid to our vendors, or our publishers to move their inventory on the MAX , right. So those are not necessarily customer of ours, but vendors put inventory where we're monetizing their inventory. And the accounting [Indiscernible] given of that, because many of the publishers are our customers as well. But then you have to have a contra revenue against the revenue they contribute to us. And then many of them are publishers who aren't our customers, we want them to be our customers. And therefore accounting system also charges that to contra revenue. So there are two different numbers, two different populations at this point. But we're hopeful that those publishers will become customers on our AppDiscovery platform. And then in terms of the migration, we do have to provide the value of 900% for the publishers now on our platform, by the way, that'll take time for them to fully scale out of the platform. And then the demand side to catch up. I think the remaining 10% are certainly other providers out there, some, one of does, some don't. But we got all the key vendors that we wanted and publisher on our platform feel very good about that exceeded our expectations. So what we'll be able to do.\nTim Nollen: Okay, so if we wanted to get an organic revenue growth number that would be then I guess it was at 835 is that the total minus to 40 that would be your organic growth.\nAdam Foroughi: Exactly. That\u2019s exactly right.\nRyan Gee: We'll go next to David Pang.\nDavid Pang: Great, can you hear me? Right. Thanks. So given the challenges of one of your key competitors, how are you ensuring that AXON won't face a similar challenge and is learning on quote unquote, good data?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, I mean, like machine learning, obviously had an opportunity and sensitivities, and really doesn't require a good data team. And a lot of that just comes down to execution. We're focused on our own execution, not let others around us are doing and really the key with us, though, is have been, we felt like if we got data and got a playground to be able to raise the models, we have the technological capacity and the infrastructure to build very substantial machine learning technologies. We did just that. And you see now for the past few quarters, growth is just really outpaced the market. We're very confident in our own the platform's ability to be stable and continue to lead to growth going forward.\nRyan Gee: We'll go to Franco Granda.\nFranco Granda: Hi, good afternoon, everyone, could you hear me, okay? Perfect. So despite the phasing out of IDFA and 14.5, it appears that probabilistic attribution still very prevalent across the industry. And there are rumors that Tyra 16 might be cracking down on this. And, yes, this is thought that using private relay, similar to Google's plans, Apple would be able to do this in a non-disruptive way. So I guess two questions on this. First, just how big of a task is it for non-compliant ad tech businesses to move away from fingerprinting, then two, if a change like this were to happen, would this be an opportunity for you to gain share in a similar way that when HAC was enacted? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, look, I think they're really like if you go up a level in the marketplace, this privacy changes have continued to come over the last few years. Part of the GDP, I don\u2019t , yes, there was frankly, was the biggest and now what Wurl does in the future, but we can't predict exactly what's going to change in the market. There's a couple of certainties. One is people can play games on their mobile devices that we know for certain, these are needed. We have a very large scale platform 700 million plus daily active users on it. So we're monetizing. And the third is that our technology and team is really nimble, we can move quickly. Whenever these market shifts happen, you always expect to see winners and losers. It's just the way it always shapes out. And why we've been able to succeed so far in the last decade is that we move faster than everyone else. And we pride ourselves on being able to do that. So while these changes can be disruptive to businesses, we look forward to change.\nRyan Gee: We'll take our last question here from Martin Yang at Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: Hey, Ryan, can you hear me? Thank you. So my question is about the first quarter software platform revenues. Even back in MoPub is very strong, seasonally, and also net expansion rate quite extraordinary. Was that a surprise to you?\nAdam Foroughi: I mean, look, when we put out a guidance into next year, 10x of the software business from just four years ago, right for a business at this level of scale, reporting on net revenue, and we've now talked about 65% to 70% EBITDA margin out of this business, to be able to do that you got a lot of confidence in your business. So even though I think we surprised ourselves with how fast this trajectory of growth became, we're not surprised on our ability to execute and continue to grow this business going forward.\nMartin Yang: Let me be more explicit are, do you feel you benefited from some of the hiccups from your competitor in the first quarter?\nHerald Chen: Okay, so the way this markets work is on zero sum. But on the flip side is one competitor ends up decaying in performance. Another one doesn't just increase, because the reality is we effectively we have models that are trying to match up idle without the latter offers, do matchmaking well and rise to the performance of the advertiser who wants to go cheap. We're not really bidding against others, what we're taking or we are getting, we need to make sure that the matchmaking is accurate, and we're driving the value to the other advertisers that are buying on our platform. So the impact from one doesn't impact us. That said the long term we want to make sure and we really do a strong job of this on the MAX platform that every marketing platform on the market is performing well. The better the marketing solutions are in the industry, the bigger the market is going to become the faster that grows more audience discovery, and more consumers will be playing more games, which is going to appeal to our growth and the ecosystem\u2019s growth. And that's why I referenced in my pie chart that we have so much of the market on our ecosystem on the MAX\u2019s platform now that we're really the success of our platform is going to direct the increase in hands on the entire sector.\nRyan Gee: Okay, and there's no more questions in the queue. Like to turn it back to the guys and thank you all for joining us today. Do you guys have any closing remarks you'd like to say?\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks for joining us. We notice a lot in letter and cover. We appreciate people taking the time, taking look into this volatile markets. Thanks so much.\nHerald Chen: Thanks everyone.",

            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "This past quarter we achieved many key milestones for AppLovin. We celebrated our 10 year anniversary in the business or one year anniversary as a public company. And we cleared over 10 billion app installs just covered through our marketing platform. We can celebrate this milestone because of the hard work and value and culture that we have in AppLovin. First, we hire and work with great people from diverse backgrounds. We give them an environment to thrive in, always trying to ensure each person has room to develop their professional and personal skills here more than anywhere else. Second, we are an entrepreneurial and we never sell. We know that in a competitive and challenging market complacency leads to failure. And third, we maintain focus, we aim to do big things. But all of our decisions are tied to our core goals continuing to expand our footprint as a marketing and monetization platform for developers. It was key to the team that we maintain these core principles as we entered a new public chapter for our company. I'm very proud to say we've done just that. [Indiscernible] demonstrated in our first quarter. Further our software platform business will continue to expand by adding new clients and increasing the amounts that existing clients are spending. The strong performance allowed to record EBITDA in Q1 of $276 million. Most software businesses lose money while growing. We're growing quickly and just clear to the $1 billion EBITDA run rate. Next, we successfully completed migrating MoPub into our MAX platform, unifying the two wireless mediation solutions in the mobile app market, we not only had to execute quickly on our side to accomplish this, we also ask publishers to integrate our platform into their app in just 90 days or risk losing their ad revenue. A couple things to call out specifically here. Historically we grew MAX to become the leading solution in the market by offering the best technology, not by paying bonuses. This is exactly how it will run our business going forward, focusing on continuing to deliver the best solution in the market. Given the short window of time to move toward a unified platform, we made the decision to payout $210 million in onetime publisher bonuses. We count into these bonuses as contra revenue. And Herald will give you the accounting details shortly. We see the opportunity to own the largest marketplace in app advertising ecosystem is strategically valuable long term. And therefore this was a decision that was an easy one to make because it helps ensure continuity with the publishers coming over from MOBA. Pushing monetization platform to the big undertaking, and we are proud that over 90% of the most of our publishers moved over to MAX. As a result, we now have a significant share in the market using our solution so much so that the success of our platform will directly influence growth in the total addressable market and success to all major parties in the ecosystem. That's a strong position to be in and a responsibility we will be proud of them. And finally, we acquired Wurl, a leader empowering streaming TV. Together, we will partner to great performance marketing the CTV. It is cleared just how quickly we push forward on items to make the biggest impact to our business when we look back just one year to the IPO and see that software was only 14% of our revenue versus 40% now. At that time, we discussed just how important the first party data that those games provided was to our software platform success. Today our software platform businesses are growing at a significant rate much faster than we expected. While there hasn't been [Indiscernible] leveled off. In fact, our software business in Q1 \u201822 is four times larger than it was in Q1 \u201821. And in Q1, software contributed over 80% of our EBITDA. For the last several quarters, we talked about how the app business is not as strategic as One Plus, with the continued scaling of our software platform, we proven that the two businesses can operate independently from one another. More directly, given the success of our software platform, we will no longer run our game as a cost center. That means we will be exploring how to structure our app business so that it is run more efficiently as its owned standalone business unit. This exploration may result in operational changes and possibly make the seller spin off from the studios. Among them are nearly 20 very [Indiscernible] gaming videos their founders and their team. We will operate the studios with a more profitable spend on user acquisition, which we already started to do in late Q1. Traditionally, we were willing to spend more on new users valuing the scale, audiences\u2019 data as a justification. This was operating it around breakeven while typically gaming companies operate at 20% or higher EBITDA margins, which we will now aim to reach over time. Mobile AppDiscovery discovery and monetization are critical for app developers now more than ever, with MAX we are the marketing leading monetization solution. AppDiscovery is the fastest early user acquisition channel for developers today, with customers paying us for performance were shielded against macroeconomic volatility. We have a powerful machine learning engine that is only 18-month old and will continue to improve. MAX allows us to serve ads to the 700 million daily active users we help monetize. We have been seasoned and navigating in complex ecosystem in a dynamic privacy landscape. With the growth opportunities across our software business and feature initiatives and the highest cash flow of our business generates even today, we're very excited about our future. Now I'll turn it over to Herald Chen to outline the details of Q1 financials and our outlook. Hey, Yousuf. I think the two questions are well tied together. And really what we're focused on with the games business, as it is today, is operated efficiently. We've got 20 or so studios, distributed all over the world, some are run very well, they generate good amount of profitability, some are generating losses. And we're going to go through the portfolio and ensure that every single one of them is held to the standards the same way any independent gaming company would be. And what gives us confidence in that is that our software business is frankly grown so much faster, and so much larger than what we thought when we first went public a year ago, we were talking about $650 million of revenue in software for the entire year this year. And we're now talking about over double that amount, around half that amount in the first quarter is quadrupled in the last four months. And so when we see that scale, what we know is that we have really become a market solution. And we've gotten a lot more software platform enterprise clients to come use our platform, we've gotten a lot more scale with the MAX and MoPub marketplace now. And that gives us the confidence that our games are only a small percentage of that software business. The other data points it's really important to point you out too is for four quarters in a row our games business has been fairly flat in both audience and revenue, whereas our software business has grown immensely. That gives us a lot of confidence in the trajectory of the software business. And we want to focus entirely on running that and achieving a couple of billion that we put out as a goal next year. Great question. In mobile, we're really confident with our position, we've got the largest marketplace, we've got act on machine learning technology that's only 18-month old, and it's going to continue to improve. That's how these things go. And then we know performance model. So we're not looking to take advice from others, we are looking to give our advertisers results that are measurable and within their financial goals. That unlocked unlimited budget. And so as we think about how to increase our market over time, and create growth factors for many years to come, we really think about finding the consumers that we know how to serve as well with recommended offerings across other access points, and that\u2019s what may be Connected-TV interesting for us, we're all being one of the leading software solutions to bring content online and Connected-TV for a lot of the brands that have content needed distributed through a channel, we advertise in that content will have immense reach, be very valuable under full train. And we think it present a really large performance model on television. And we're going to focus on continuing expanding the software business and putting our machine learning software in as many places as we can go. So MoPub and MAX together is on top of 700 million daily active users around the world, and these consumers in large part on our platform, they're playing games, but I can assure you they don't just play games, the only thing they do in their life, so they're very good audience that level of scale to monetize on both games and non-games, we traditionally focus our solutions for the game developer and really built a lot of performance technology there, MoPub products access to the MoPub marketplace. And that's how they monetize their eyeballs. And the marketplace itself is directly access for companies like the Trade Desk, which we announced a partnership with last court to buy into our exchange. So as we continue to integrate, and push forward after this month of transaction, those types of relationships we're going to see more and more monetization potential is very large audience from non-gaming customers to augment the credit and market leading solution, we have at mobile gaming category. Yes, so as we think about like the integration that we just did, we put together the largest really open marketplace and mobile apps is average of just over 700 million daily active users in one exchange is a very large amount. So we've heard really positive feedback from the customers coming over. They were traditional DSP buying on MoPub, thinking that MoPub was the biggest solution.

And that's what you're seeing really fuel our growth, you're seeing the increase in size where we've almost tripled them in the last 12- month. You're seeing that net dollar retention. I mean, I think it was around 265%, just this past quarter. These are the same customers a year ago, spending nearly tripled on our platform today. And that's because the efficiencies that we're bringing to the market is enabling them to do that and grow their businesses faster than the markets growth. Yes, great question.

Yes, I think you asked the contribution was from MoPub in the quarter and it was just over $40 million, specifically. And we can -- we know that number, because Twitter was still running that business for us in the quarter, subsequently valued integrated entirely in the MAX, MoPub as everyone knows, was completely shut down March 31 of this year, and so it's fully integrated in our numbers rolling forwards, we won't be able to parse it out, because all the data and the consumer customers are all integrated. But we expect to increase that number quarter-over-quarter, as we've shown ultimately, in our software guide for the year. Yes, the MAX solution itself, really, we built and push the markets and I think and up and partnership with Facebook really were the first two big bidders in the marketplace. And clients are coming over to MAX's yet we're not bidding out of the box, what we have seen is strong performance for the publishers that have come over. And frankly, just because of the scale, we've got some liquidity on the platform. It allows us to get more differentiated demand, and the technology was built much later than the other mediation solutions. And that's why we've had such a strong trajectory to Max before MoPub and why we continue to expect it to be the leading solution in the marketplace. Yes, thanks, Tim, for the questions. Yes, sorry, this would require clarifications, on the revenue side that we take to our software business, specifically coming out of MoPub customers with the $40 million, the $210 million we are referring to is the fees that we paid to our vendors, or our publishers to move their inventory on the MAX , right.

And then many of them are publishers who aren't our customers, we want them to be our customers. And therefore accounting system also charges that to contra revenue. So there are two different numbers, two different populations at this point. But we're hopeful that those publishers will become customers on our AppDiscovery platform. And then in terms of the migration, we do have to provide the value of 900% for the publishers now on our platform, by the way, that'll take time for them to fully scale out of the platform. And then the demand side to catch up. I think the remaining 10% are certainly other providers out there, some, one of does, some don't. But we got all the key vendors that we wanted and publisher on our platform feel very good about that exceeded our expectations. So what we'll be able to do. Exactly. That\u2019s exactly right. Yes, I mean, like machine learning, obviously had an opportunity and sensitivities, and really doesn't require a good data team. And a lot of that just comes down to execution. We're focused on our own execution, not let others around us are doing and really the key with us, though, is have been, we felt like if we got data and got a playground to be able to raise the models, we have the technological capacity and the infrastructure to build very substantial machine learning technologies. We did just that. And you see now for the past few quarters, growth is just really outpaced the market. We're very confident in our own the platform's ability to be stable and continue to lead to growth going forward. Yes, look, I think they're really like if you go up a level in the marketplace, this privacy changes have continued to come over the last few years. Part of the GDP, I don\u2019t , yes, there was frankly, was the biggest and now what Wurl does in the future, but we can't predict exactly what's going to change in the market. There's a couple of certainties. One is people can play games on their mobile devices that we know for certain, these are needed. We have a very large scale platform 700 million plus daily active users on it. So we're monetizing. And the third is that our technology and team is really nimble, we can move quickly. Whenever these market shifts happen, you always expect to see winners and losers. It's just the way it always shapes out. And why we've been able to succeed so far in the last decade is that we move faster than everyone else. And we pride ourselves on being able to do that. So while these changes can be disruptive to businesses, we look forward to change. I mean, look, when we put out a guidance into next year, 10x of the software business from just four years ago, right for a business at this level of scale, reporting on net revenue, and we've now talked about 65% to 70% EBITDA margin out of this business, to be able to do that you got a lot of confidence in your business. So even though I think we surprised ourselves with how fast this trajectory of growth became, we're not surprised on our ability to execute and continue to grow this business going forward. Thanks for joining us. We notice a lot in letter and cover. We appreciate people taking the time, taking look into this volatile markets. Thanks so much."

            "content": "Thanks very much. As Adam mentioned, with the growth environment for our software platform, plus a new operating approach for our apps portfolio, we're excited about our near and long term growth prospects and cash flow outlook. Don't you better understand that thesis going forward, we'll be providing greater insights to the economic drivers of our two businesses. And regarding the overall cash generation of our company, for a quick preview what Adam just described in more detail shortly. Our guidance for the software platform business is to generate over $1 billion of revenue in a second through fourth quarter this year. Based on an estimated margin for that business was 70% and a flow through the cash of another estimated 70% that business alone will generate over $0.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow in the next three quarters alone. Now let's get back to the quarter and it\u2019s in the Q1 we make some key decisions and good progress to our goals. I'll highlight a few in detail before we take your questions. The first topic is our overall strong spending in margins. We have strong quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth on both the top and bottom line when adjusting for the $210 million of contra revenue we booked in Q1 which were the bonuses paid to publishers related to the MoPub transaction. Our burst in Q1 was driven by the growth in our software platform revenue more than making up for a modest decline in our app revenue. But let me spend a few minutes on the contra revenue so you can appreciate the growth and margin expansion that we saw in the quarter. First of all, just the accounting of contra revenue. We pay these publisher bonuses to our vendors that are currently or may become future customer of ours. And since GAAP requires offsetting revenue for fees you pay to customers or potential customers, these publisher migration bonuses have $210 million are accounted for as contra revenue. Second, these are non-recurring and a result from the MoPub transaction. Historically, we did not incur these fees in any significant size. But when you shut down one of the largest players in mediation and ask their publishers to move over in 90 days, those publishers incur real revenue loss and cost to migrate. Going forward we deny these publisher bonuses as a significant cost to our normal business and we did not have them before MoPub nor we project anything significant going forward. Because the MoPub related fees are non-recurring, we add it back to adjusted EBITDA and any non MoPub related publisher bonuses as we would see after Q1 we will not be adding back to adjusted EBITDA, so therefore, it is just a onetime occurrence in this quarter, in this past quarter. For reporting purposes, on the revenue side, we cannot add back the contra revenue. But for internal purposes, of course, we combined the two numbers, which adds up to around 38% greater than ourQ4 number. Overall, we continue to return $210 million of contra revenue as part of our $1.05 billion purchase rights for MoPub, the total price for that edition was 1.26 grand. And that's a very attractive price for such a strategic and financially accretive asset. On a cash flow side, Adam mentioned, we had good record of $276 million in EBITDA with a reported margin of 44%. When normalizing revenue for the publisher bonuses, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which you can see in purple here that we think is the normal run rate of the business. And that is a 500 basis point increase over 28% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This margin expansion was entirely driven by the strong growth of our high margin software business. And in fact, the margin was slightly reduced by our assets where the reduction in apps revenue was in large are offset by user acquisition spending, but was still related to our overall margin. As we mentioned in shareholder letter, we currently got to make our software platform business currently runs at a normalized EBITDA margin of 65% to 70%. And our apps business at an estimated EBITDA margin of 5% to 10%. Therefore faster growth of software related apps tries margin expansion. We will be providing more details on this in our Q2 earnings report where we will be providing segmented financials for the first time. Our strong [Indiscernible] for software platform revenue and margin plus operating costs management allows us to raise our EBITDA guidance for this year and we'll talk about further in a minute. Of note at our current operating scale, we're able to translate a significant percentage of our EBITDA to unlevered free cash flow given our low CapEx, working capital requirements and moderate tax rate. We estimate that normalized run rate percentage of adjusted EBITDA translating to unlevered free cash flow to around 65% and 75%. The next slide we want to show you or talk about our software expansion for the quarter. So we\u2019ve heard now a few times from Adam and me we believe that software platform growth is key for our long-term growth and cash flow. So let's take a deeper look at our Q1 software performance. First of all, as noted in purple, you can see all of the onetime contra revenue is taken against our software revenue. But when added to GAAP revenue of $119 million, the total is $329 million for Q1 that represents 33% quarter-over-quarter growth rate on top of strong third quarter growth over our prior three quarters. We saw strong customer adoption across all of our solutions including AppDiscovery, AppLovin Exchange, Adjust and MAX. As we started to pick up revenue from the integrated MoPub customers. Our customers continue to find success with our solutions are growing their business and in turn spending more on us. Of note in Q1, we received approximately $40 million of revenue from both our Twitter and expect the revenue from the acquisition to grow over the course of the year. However, going forward, it will be difficult to discern what revenue comes explicitly from MoPub now that it is fully integrated into MAX. Across the board on software KPIs, we had a very solid performance normalized for the contra revenue impact. We have 258% net dollar based revenue retention in the quarter over prior year showing the resiliency of our customers and continued increase in the use of our software solutions. We also had a solid increase in the number of new customers. Our normalized SPEC count reached 519, an increase over 58 customers, but we still believe that a small percentage of customers available to us in the marketplace. The additions were across the business including from new additions from customers migrating from MoPub as well as for new customers from AppDiscovery and Adjust. On top of the more customers we saw the average revenue increase on average from all of our SPECs reaching normalized $603,000, a steady increase over the past three quarters. Of note, when we are taking the $210 million of contra revenue out of this metrics, we still were able to grow net dollar base retention and the total number of SPECs. For the third topic, we wanted to provide you an update on our guidance where we're increasing our \u201922 adjusted EBITDA target. For \u201922, our operating outlook for the software platform remains the same as previously given. However, we're adjusting our formal guidance by the $210 million in contra revenue to GAAP revenue guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.29 billion. We're continuing to expect $2 billion in software platform revenue in 2023, which will be a 10x increase from 2020 and a 65% increase over the midpoint of a revised software platform guidance in \u201822. We believe we have the market solutions technology and team to reach that goal. Further, given our scalable cost structure, which we articulated earlier, we believe that cash flow from a $2 billion revenue software business would be substantial. Switching to the app side investment, as Adam mentioned, our software platform and immense feature of MAX solution means we are much less reliant on the data from our apps to drive financial performance for our clients. Therefore, we're planning to manage that business to optimize for operating and financial efficiency, with a perspective on how to best drive cash flow from that business over the long term. In the near and medium term, that may include lowering our investment and user acquisition will drive up -- which will drive up margins for lower overall growth. We will also do a review of our app portfolio which could lead to a wide array of transactions or no change at all. Based on this new approach, we're lowering our revenue guidance by $200 million. And now targeting a range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion in revenue from apps in \u201822. The combination of our changes in software and app guidance leads to our revised total guidance of $3.14 billion to $3.44 billion on a GAAP basis. With regard to adjusted EBITDA, given a record performance and strong margins, we're raising adjusted EBITDA guidance to midpoint target of $1.2 billion. This target again represents a 65% increase over the prior year. This is also an increase from our previous guidance of high 20% margin against the total revenue forecast at midpoint for $3.7 billion, which equated to just over $1 billion. Key drivers in the same region EBITDA guidance for the much higher growth for our software platform business, which as I said, has a much higher margin profile. We have lower investment requirements than originally earmarked for new initiatives. And we now have a higher margin expected from our apps business as we optimize it. From an overall margin perspective, this equates with 36% \u201822 adjusted EBITDA margin at midpoint of GAAP revenue guidance, and a 34% of adjusted EBITDA margin when excluding the contra revenue. Therefore, the 34% target is our runway margin to focus on which would be an 800 basis point increase over the prior year. Since we do generate a good amount of cash flow, I wanted to touch briefly on our go for capital allocation perspectives. Previously stated we're not focused on M&A for the apps parts of the business, we will -- and we'll opportunistically look on the software side. Although there too we've assembled many of the key assets we wanted to look at 18-months. Then with regard to the stock buyback side, we do have our $750 million authorized program, and we use just over $45 million thus far. We are planning to use that authorization when appropriate and are open to doing so given the right opportunity. We appreciate the public markets are highly volatile and difficult to predict. In these markets, we believe cash is king and cash flow growth is king and queen. That's exactly where our team is focused. We believe in our strategic position growth and cash generation potential. And we will work hard at quarter after quarter to post the numbers that will earn your trust. Thank you for taking the time to get an update on our business. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Ryan? And Clark, thanks for the question. The other question you had was around margins and invest in a new initiative. I think last year, we talked about being the highest 20 so margins this year, and there are three big investments we needed to make. One was the infrastructure to grow the software platform as fast as if you are going to particular given MoPub. The second was the investment in new initiatives. And we put bucket aside, not knowing exactly what that would look like. And then the third one was realized new apps with studios, we on boarded to go invest behind that. I think very simply the first one we're still doing it or actually have done that's in place. We're on board due to the vast majority of what we wanted to do on MoPub and because of that infrastructure in place, and now we'll get to continue to grow as MoPub and the software platform that does grow. I think the other big pieces, do you have changes to them. On the new initiatives side, we're pursuing the NFT block chain as well as the OEM strategies, and I'll touch on that in a second. We're still as bullish as we were in the first quarter of out there that we just don't think it takes as much dollars this year is investing behind it to go to achieve that. And then we talked about the app side, which is a very different approach in terms of the investment there. We told you before that the M&A dollars would not be allocated there. And now we're telling you that importantly though we're running at low single digit margins, and they really should be in their 20s margins. And so there's a lot of room for us to improve that from an OpEx standpoint. So we're -- we still remain extremely excited about the new initiatives. We talked about UCTV with world being one OEM another and then the NFT block chain and we would expect in the next couple of 12-month, if not sooner be coming back to you to describe some of the progress we're making on all these fronts. Okay, so the way this markets work is on zero sum. But on the flip side is one competitor ends up decaying in performance. Another one doesn't just increase, because the reality is we effectively we have models that are trying to match up idle without the latter offers, do matchmaking well and rise to the performance of the advertiser who wants to go cheap. We're not really bidding against others, what we're taking or we are getting, we need to make sure that the matchmaking is accurate, and we're driving the value to the other advertisers that are buying on our platform. So the impact from one doesn't impact us. That said the long term we want to make sure and we really do a strong job of this on the MAX platform that every marketing platform on the market is performing well. The better the marketing solutions are in the industry, the bigger the market is going to become the faster that grows more audience discovery, and more consumers will be playing more games, which is going to appeal to our growth and the ecosystem\u2019s growth. And that's why I referenced in my pie chart that we have so much of the market on our ecosystem on the MAX\u2019s platform now that we're really the success of our platform is going to direct the increase in hands on the entire sector. Thanks everyone."

Joining me today to discuss our results are Adam Foroughi, our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson; and Matt Stumpf, our CFO. Please note, our SEC filings to date, as well as our shareholder letter and press release discussing our fourth quarter and annual performance are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our products and services, market expectations, the future financial performance of the company, and other future events. These statements are based on our current assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them except as required by law. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. Please be sure to review the reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and shareholder letter available on our Investor Relations site. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our IR website. Now I'll turn it over to Adam and Matt for some opening remarks, then we'll have the moderator take us through Q&A.\nAdam Foroughi: Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining. We're thrilled to report another outstanding quarter in Q4. We surpassed the high-end of our guidance and established a consistent pattern of exceptional performance throughout 2023. Reflecting on the last year, it's remarkable to consider how much we have grown and evolved in just one year. After a challenging 2022 characterized by stagnant growth, we refocused on growing our existing business and investing in new initiatives. I am immensely proud of our team's dedication and hard work, which has resulted in our software platform revenue growing by 76% in 2023. Despite a challenged economic landscape and mobile gaming sector, we have continued to grow. This is a clear testament to the strength and potential of the updates we have made to our AI advertising engine, AXON. When we embarked on our public journey in 2021, Software Platform revenue was nearly $700 million. And now, only two years later, we have reached close to $2 billion. We also forecast that we would have significant margins on incremental revenue for our software business. I'm proud to state that in Q4 2023, our incremental revenue had an approximate 80% flow through to adjusted EBITDA, culminating in record cash flows. This growth trajectory underscores a robust financial health and positions us favorably for diverse opportunities to enhance shareholder value, like ongoing share repurchases. Now, looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, we continue to remain bullish about the potential of our core AI technologies, which stand amongst the most advanced across all markets. Our focus on leveraging these technologies for World in the CTV space and Array in the Carrier & OEM market is just the beginning. We are poised to explore and expand into new applications of our AI technologies in the coming quarters and years, which has the potential to significantly broaden our TAM and opportunities. Now, I'll turn it over to Matt, who will deliver his first financial summary as our CFO. We are incredibly fortunate to have him in this role. Thank you once again for your unwavering support on this journey.\nMatt Stumpf: Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to step into my first earnings release as CFO with such amazing financial results. So first, I'd like to thank the team for having executed so well this quarter and making my job easy. In the fourth quarter, we exceeded the high end of our guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, achieving $953 million in total revenue and $476 million in adjusted EBITDA. That's an impressive 50% adjusted EBITDA margin. We also exceeded our analyst expectations this quarter by beating the consensus averages for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly 10% higher than expectations. Our revenue grew by 36% from the same period last year and 10% from last quarter. Optimization efforts within our Apps business in the first-half of the year resulted in a slight decline in revenue, but it led to improved EBITDA margin. We still grew revenue every quarter this year due to the tremendous performance of our software platform and continued strength and growth in the advertising market. Our Apps portfolio continues to perform well with 5% growth from last quarter, while maintaining a consistent 15% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Software Platform had another excellent quarter. We achieved a revenue of $576 million and adjusted EBITDA of $420 million, that's a 73% margin. This represents nearly an 80% flow through from revenue, given our relatively fixed cost base and continued cost discipline. All of our businesses were able to grow their revenue this quarter, with AppDiscovery, the primary driver of our success. Our growth stemmed from a combination of market factors and our execution, including a strong holiday season, growth in the mobile advertising market, a market shift to real-time bidding, early contributions from our Array business, enhancement of our technologies like AXON, expansion of our advertiser base, and growth in advertiser budgets. The combination of these factors are contributing to improved efficiency, leading to compounding growth for our company and our partners in the industry. Turning briefly to our annual results. Revenue for the year was $3.3 billion, that's an increase of 17% from last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, that's an incredible 41% increase from last year at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. Over the last five years, we've been able to achieve remarkable growth in our Software Platform business. We grew from $136 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2019 to nearly $1.3 billion this year. During that time, we had roughly 60% to 70% adjusted EBITDA margin. Free cash flow for the year was $1 billion, representing an impressive 69% flow through from adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Going forward, we hope to retain roughly 70% flow through on an annual basis, with quarterly fluctuations due to working capital and tax payments. During the year, we extended the maturity of our term loan to 2030. At the same time, reducing our interest rate to continue to manage our ongoing costs. In addition to our debt management activities this year, we also repurchased and withheld a combined 54.3 million shares in 2023. After considering share compensation, this represents a nearly 10% reduction in our total shares outstanding. Through the combination of free cash flow generation and share management, we hope to continue to generate significant long-term value for our existing and our new shareholders. Our Board has also approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. We plan to use this to continue to manage our outstanding shares. Turning to our first quarter 2024 guidance, we hope to deliver between $955 million and $975 million in revenue in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within the range of $475 million and $495 million. That represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 50% and 51%. We believe these results are achievable, given the various growth factors I highlighted earlier. While taking into account, the first quarter is a seasonally low period for the industry. In conclusion, we're very happy with our financial performance this quarter and for all of 2023, as a result of a strengthening market combined with our team's execution. We look forward to continued growth over the coming year as we continue to expand our business into new verticals and industries such as non-gaming and CTV. Now with that, I'll hand it over to our moderator to take us through the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Matt. And now we will take your questions. When I call your name, please turn on your video and unmute. And we will get through as many questions as possible in the time allotted. And our first question is going to come from Omar Dessouky with BofA. Omar, go ahead and come off video, please. Great. Thank you.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. So, let's see, on the one hand, you're not giving calendar year '24 guidance, but on the other hand, you did talk about in your letter that you're working towards expanding your software platform reach in 2024. So I was wondering if you could unpack those two things for us, especially the software platform reach part. Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Omar. I'll start with the business side, and then Matt will jump into the financials. But ultimately, we launched AXON 2, the upgrade of our AI platform in Q2 last year. From that point to Q4, the business -- the software business grew almost 50%. And obviously, you know, the impact on margins. We've talked about a huge flow through in dollars. The incremental dollars of growth there coming in at 80% roughly in the quarter. This is an early-stage technology. It's only been live for a little over half a year. It's growing exceptionally quickly, very high margin. We think the applications of this core technology are much broader than what we do today. And the team is continuously improving the technology, too. So we're very excited about where it could go. Ultimately, when you've got a business that's growing that quickly on a technology that's that new at the margins we operate at, it's very hard to understand going forward exactly where we're going to land, but we've never been more excited about the growth prospects we've got in front of us.\nMatt Stumpf: Yes. Just to echo what Adam said, Omar, given the difficulty in kind of forecasting and understanding the impact of launching a new technology like we did with AXON 2.0, it's very difficult for us to forecast what the impact, what the financial impact of that is. So for that reason, we don't provide longer-term guidance.\nOmar Dessouky: And then just a quick follow-up, if I could. So Facebook called out Chinese advertisers, both e-commerce and video game publishers is one of the reasons their advertising outperformed in Q4. I didn't see it in your shareholder letter, and I was wondering if that's something you guys had seen at all or perhaps expecting in the first quarter.\nAdam Foroughi: No, we don't have any specific concentration or change of mix, and we index lower in terms of Chinese partners to rest the world than I think they do. But this is something we'd called out during COVID. China lockdown was a huge area of inefficiency in the market. So we've seen the market really hit a trough last year, or two years ago, and then start recovering late last year. A lot of that was because Chinese developers were back in office for a year, coming back online, getting efficient again. And we'd signaled that we thought eventually that's going to help bring efficiency back to the market, because while we don't index heavily on the revenue side, there is a lot of content that's created out of China that comes out West and does benefit advertising-related businesses. And so that was a good trend that we've seen continue to expand.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Omar.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tim Nolan with Macquarie.\nTim Nolan: Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, we got you, Tim.\nTim Nolan: Okay, great. Thanks. I had some trouble with the sound on the first part of the presentation. I'm glad you can hear me now. I wanted to ask about some of these big changes coming in the mobile ad landscape this year, namely the DMA, which comes into effect, I guess, in a couple of weeks\u2019 time, three weeks\u2019 time, and also the deprecation of the Google Android ID and then also the iOS 17.4, kind of, a lot of things in there to wonder about how it might impact the mobile ad markets here. I wonder if you could comment on those, please.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Look, I think we've said this before, when it comes to privacy, Tim, is you don't know dates on a lot of these releases. So when you're talking about Google, like, who knows when the actual rollout will be. Cookies were a lot later than expected and still in a very small percentage rollout. So we don't know when these changes will come. We don't know the exact impact of the changes. What we do know is that, one, the way we've operated traditionally, we're very entrepreneurial, we're very nimble, and we've been able to adapt very well whenever there have been these changes. And number two, we run a much more of a contextual behavioral model than a lot of properties on the OpenWeb. And so, because we don't interface as much when it comes to really sensitive user data with the consumer, we're in a much better starting point than a lot of other businesses, too. So those two things always give us confidence that no matter what the change is, we're going to be able to navigate it.\nTim Nolan: Okay, could I ask a follow-up on the DMA, which would be, do you think, you know, allowing much lower App Store fees in Europe at least would be a positive for app development, which might then lead to more ad spending going down the road? Or do you have any opinion on the Apple response to be adding this extra $0.50 charge?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, the way Apple responded makes it not really a great business decision to go off store, because one thing people don't talk about is there is organic value to being on store. So if you take the 30% fee and figure 10 points to 15 points of value from organic rank, then you're down to 15 points of cost savings and the expense to the developer that they -- all the different layers of expense amounted to roughly 20 points. So there's no economic reason to go off-store today. We think over time, though, there's enough global pressure and there's going to be enough movement from the courts over time that they're going to continue to scrutinize us in different jurisdictions where eventually we think there could be benefits economically to the content developers. And if that happens, we've always said that's going to greatly benefit the advertising solutions. If you just think about the dollars on our platform, majority are transacted to drive IAP today and the dollar is taxed down to $0.70. If that one day went to [85-15] (ph), you could go take that and say every developer now makes 20% more, and how much of that are they going to be willing to put into marketing? A large part of it, which would be greatly beneficial to a platform like ours.\nTim Nolan: Yes. Great. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Moving on to Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. This is maybe a long-winded question, but I can't help but look at your stock and the multiple seems so low to me, given the attractiveness of your business and the growth and the free cash flow conversion. And I saw the $1.2 billion authorization on buybacks. But I don't think you bought back any stock in the quarter, and yet your guidance is good. You knew it was going to be above the street. So my first question is, can you just comment on sort of the tactical pause in the fourth quarter on buybacks? And then my second one, related is, do you think your multiple is low because of the two divergent businesses that you have between the software platform and first-party games? And does that still make sense to hold these two businesses together, given that one is phenomenally attractive and one is just good? Thanks.\nMatt Stumpf: Yes, I'll take the buyback piece first.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes.\nMatt Stumpf: So, Jason, just from a strategic view, our approach to doing buybacks is to do directed large repurchases rather than buyback in the open market. That's how we feel like we can have the most impact. And the opportunity didn't present itself in Q4 to do a large buyback from an existing shareholder. So to the extent that, that does present itself in the future, that's the approach that we're going to take.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. And we just did authorize the big buyback. We're going to be committed to it going forward. We do think as a company like ours, where we're generating this much cash flow, we should be able to continue to facilitate buybacks and return value to shareholders in that manner. When it comes to the question of where we trade, why we trade at the certain multiple we trade at, but we can't answer that. We're not traders, and it's very hard to unpack. Does mobile gaming discount the overall company valuation? We don't, frankly believe so, because the core software business is growing so quickly and we break out financials. So it's pretty easy to just say, let's just look at the software segment. There is -- we think the harder part when it comes to our business is that we were in a no-growth period in '22. We've had to come off of that and really focus on execution, which is what we asked of our teams. And now we put together four subsequent quarters of stellar performance. And as you look at that software segment, there's not a lot of software businesses with 70% plus EBITDA margin growing at the rate that is, I mean, rule of 140, 150 or whatever. And so, it's just an astounding number. And then we convert a very high percentage of that EBITDA to cash flow as well. So we think because the technologies are new, it'll take a while for investors to understand what we already see, which is not only is this very powerful technology in our core market, we've been able to grow much greater than the market is growing because this technology is efficient. And in conjunction with that, our partners are growing much faster, too. And you see some of these games that are in the market today at the top of the top grossing, they depend on our marketing channel, and they're growing because our solutions become more efficient. That's in our core market. And now we see applications of that technology in multiple adjacent markets, and we think we're going to be able to go apply it, not only to what we've talked about some other applications too, that we'll talk about in the upcoming quarters. And that's what gets us really excited. So we're for sure committed to buybacks because we see value and we're able to unpack the value much more easily today than investors are. And we hope to be able to articulate that narrative in the coming quarters to investors.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nOperator: Then we will now hear from Ralph Schackart, I apologize, with William Blair.\nRalph Schackart: Hey, good afternoon, Adam and Matt. Thanks for taking the question. First one, I know you've talked historically about AXON 2 extending beyond just sort of the gaming vertical. But maybe just sort of give us an update on the progress. Are you starting to get contributions outside of the gaming vertical? And then I have a follow-up.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Thanks, Ralph. Non-gaming is growing faster. Gaming, it's smaller, so obviously there's more room to grow. It's going to be a commitment of ours to broaden out the platform. We've talked about broadening out to non-gaming, that's a component. We've talked about Connected TV. That was an application that's in progress right now, expanding our reach to the television device. We've talked about delivering marketing solutions to carriers and OEMs powered by AXON 2, that's in progress as well. We're starting to see, as Matt touched on in his script, some benefit from both those initiatives. And we think there are not only those applications, but more beyond that, that we'll talk about in the coming quarters as well. And so, we're very excited about not only what our solution can do within our core category, but the expansion opportunities it presents us.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Maybe you could sort of provide some context of what's really outperforming versus expectations. I'm sure there's an element of conservatism on wanting to guide. But just sort of frame for investors, why is AXON 2 doing better perhaps than you expected?\nAdam Foroughi: Look, I mean, what people don't understand about our platform, and I guess we don't tend to articulate to is the MAX business sits on top of over 1 billion daily active users, 1 billion users playing games. So if you think about in the U.S., roughly 170 million daily active users. So you're talking about the majority of American adults are playing games daily in mobile apps, and we're able to service them. Historically, in this channel, the modernization has been very low per 1,000 impressions, compared to what the social networks and the search engines and the video apps have gotten to. And those companies had very sophisticated technology and a lot of data. We've been able to get to a point now where our technology has become much more efficient. So we're just monetizing this audience more effectively. What gets us really excited is we're a couple of quarters in. We're really starting from a low monetization point. The whole market is monetizing these users playing games at a low point. When you have that much reach, 170 million daily actives in the states, these aren't people that are just playing mobile games. There's just no way. It's a very, very widespread audience, predominantly adult that are doing other things. And as these technologies get to a point of predicting more broader application of advertising to this audience, not only will it get more efficient, it will expand out the reach for a company like ours to other verticals, and it will create more efficiency for the publisher, we should grow everything. And so that's what gets us really excited is it all comes down to efficiently monetizing a huge audience that we have access to.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Maybe if I could just sneak one more in. We get the question all the time in simple terms, if you could explain what's the main difference from AXON 2 versus AXON 1. Maybe just for simplicity sake, for investors sort of frame what's the biggest change or observation you see on your end? Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, it's just better. I mean just the technology is built to scale better, it's more efficient, more effective. These are predictive technologies at the end of the day. And I'm drawing the analogy to Chat GPT. And the only reason I do that is because we can all type in a box and get a result. And we all know that Chat GPT 3 to 3.5 to 4, 4 was better than 3.5, it was better than 3, right? But we could have seen that. Well, what we can't see in a black box algorithm is a type in and a result. But what we can see is that what we're trying to predict is show an advertisement to a consumer for some advertiser and drive value to the advertiser. And there's a whole bunch of predictions along the way, and AXON 2 makes them better than the prior version. And that creates a lot of efficiency gain, both for our business and that of our partners.\nRalph Schackart: Okay. Thanks. Adam.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes.\nOperator: Cannonball's Vasily Karasyov has the next question.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. I have two. First one, can you talk in a little more detail about different trends for domestic and international markets that you see and revenue or maybe metrics. Is there any difference? Do you see different penetration and customer response? And then the second one is, given what you said about extending software platform, how sustainable or the EBITDA margins in this segment that we saw in Q4? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: So on the first, we don't see a whole lot of difference domestic to international. There's consumption that drives our value and there's efficiency of the algorithms and partners that are advertising on us that drive the value. And so other than like one-off holidays in international locations that would alter the revenue percentages. If you assume the period of engagement is consistent, then the revenue mix would also be consistent. And the other core thing to always remember about our business is, all of our advertising is 100% performance-based. So an advertiser that wants a specific performance of yield and the U.S. is willing to get the same yield in Turkey or in the U.K. or in Germany or in Japan. And so when they advertise with us, they are predominantly global advertisers. So we don't tend to see much variance there.\nMatt Stumpf: And on your second question, Vasily, in terms of just margin. We haven't seen any significant difference. I mean, as Adam mentioned previously, it's relatively small at this point, the non-gaming component of the business. But as we push into these other new verticals and industries, we don't see any material difference between the margin profiles of the existing mobile gaming business or non-gaming.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. We've let you all know that when you see roughly 80% flow-through, we don't really expect that to be different as that software business continues to grow. The flow-through should be a really high conversion to EBITDA.\nVasily Karasyov: So Q4 is indicative of what we should expect next year? Every quarter?\nAdam Foroughi: No. On the incremental revenue growth, yes.\nMatt Stumpf: Yes. I mean if you look at just our guidance, Vasily, we're guiding to a similar position, right, in the 50% to 51% overall EBITDA margin.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you so much. Congratulations.\nMatt Stumpf: You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: And Matt Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatt Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. So from a real-time bidding perspective, it looks like I might have frozen. Can you still hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes.\nMatt Stumpf: Yes.\nMatt Cost: Okay. Good. Well, then we'll keep going. From a real-time bidding perspective, how much of the market has shifted towards real-time bidding at this point? And then can you talk about the financial impact that, that will have when that process is complete and how investors should think that through? And then I have a second.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. So the first one, the Google announcements on their move to go predominantly real-time bidding in mobile mediated auctions came out, I think it was some point in October. And they had a commitment to do by January. But throughout Q4, the vast majority of the market was traded in a programmatic real-time manner. And the impact of that is twofold for a business like ours. One is we've operated the MAX platform not charging anything to advertising companies when they're not real-time bidding, but charging a take rate of 5% when they are real time bidding. And we've disclosed that number before. That's just a consistent fee that we charge to bid on our platform. Now with the majority of the market moving that way, that's a good economic development for the MAX platform, and that obviously benefits our software segment. On the second point of the impact, what real-time bidding does is clear an auction faster. There's less consumption. So there's just less infrastructural load in order to process a real-time auction versus a waterfall auction, and there's a quicker ad delivery. And by delivering an advertisement more quickly, the publisher benefits because they can show more advertisements to their consumer whenever they want to, instead of waiting for an advertisement to actually clear, it clears faster and more show. By doing that, it creates a world where the publisher starts yielding more in an efficient manner which can then drive up their ad revenue per user. And then the whole formula that we operate on is the publisher makes more, they reinvest more in the user acquisition, their business grows, and we enable that growth, and our business grows with it. So we're only seeing positive from this transition.\nMatt Cost: And then the second question was just on the competitive environment. Obviously, one of different competitors is going through a major restructuring. I guess, are you seeing any shift positive or negative in the competitive landscape year-to-date?\nAdam Foroughi: Look, since we went public, we've been a very strong independent leader in the sector. I don't think anything has changed there. We've been focused on executing ourselves. And as our technology has gotten more efficient. Obviously, we're driving more value to advertisers. But we've said this for, I think, multiple quarters now, none of us operate in a zero-sum game. So when we're able to drive more value to these advertisers who are buying on a performance basis, they don't go, we have a fixed budget and we're going to pull from here. They go, okay, we have a budget over here. We have budget over here. But AppLovin is now 5 times better than they were. So let's expand the budget with them, too. And they're able to reinvest more dollars into the user acquisition, which helps their businesses grow. And that's what makes the space quite appealing is that none of it is zero sum, whether on the publisher or the advertiser side. And so we've been able to focus heads down on our own execution. Our team has built really cutting-edge technology that works better than any other -- I think any of the advertisers or our peers have seen in the sector, but that benefits everyone in the sector. And so we're excited that, that is just a reality of the industry we're in.\nMatt Cost: Great, thank you.\nOperator: David Karnovsky with JPMorgan has the next question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Adam, maybe relative to your prior shareholder letters, you seem to be describing a mobile market, which is broadly inflecting for the better. So I wanted to see if you could walk through some of the drivers of that, what you're seeing. And then for Matt, wanted to confirm, you said 70% free cash flow conversion expected from here. I think the prior range was 50% to 60%. So maybe what's driving the better flow-through? And then just housekeeping on the Q1 guide, any color in terms of expected apps growth there even on a directional basis? Should you gain sequentially? Or would we see sort of a seasonal decrease? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: I'll have Matt cover two and three. On the first one, on the mobile market, we put out a blog. I think it was around Thanksgiving. So it was a good one, highlighting just CPM growth in the industry, comparing '23 to '22 holiday period. And what we saw in Q4 was that just coming off of weak comps in '22 when every part of the economy was fearful and this sector was particularly fearful we saw brands and performance advertisers more willing to invest in marketing dollars. Now what we don't know about that is are the AI-driven advancements in the marketing technologies that you've seen implied by our numbers and our performance and technology and what Facebook has done and what Google have done over the last year driven that acceleration? Or is it just the economy recovering? And we think it's a function of both. And we actually think because we're not brand advertising at all. Ours is entirely due to the technology efficiency, you're seeing this market start recovering. It's coming off from weak comps. So getting back to growth is easier than it was in the past. But the marketing technology is evolving from here and continuing to improve is going to be a really good catalyst for a return to growth for this mobile market.\nMatt Stumpf: In terms of free cash flow, David, so we didn't guide to 70% going forward on a long-term basis. On a quarterly basis, we will have fluctuations depending upon just working capital and then also the timing of tax payments. But we are seeing better free cash flow conversion from EBITDA than we were expecting, which is a positive impact that we're seeing from all the technology improvements that we've done. And then in terms of the Q1 guide, your last question, Obviously, we don't provide segment guidance, so I won't comment on apps versus software, but we are happy to be able to guide into Q1 with slight growth considering the fact that it is a seasonally low period for the advertising market.\nOperator: Anything else, David? All right. Well, Adam and Matt, we will take our last question from Chris Kuntarich with UBS.\nChris Kuntarich: Great, thanks for taking the question. I think we're a bit further on into the CTV testing at this point. Can you just give us some feedback from advertisers on how that adoption is going?\nAdam Foroughi: Look, the CTV testing and the rollout is early stage. And we've got a really large software platform business now with net revenue near $2 billion. So for it to become very substantial for these advertisers as the ways out, they're all intrigued by it because traditionally, and I don't know if you do channel checks, you won't find another place where these advertisers can buy on a performance basis, the way we can enable it on Connected TV today. So I'd say it's first inning, everyone is excited by prospect of being able to go recruit a consumer on a new device that they just had never had the access to before in the way that we can enable it but it's early and in our business as big as we are and as fast growing as that business is for any new initiative to make a material impact, we're talking multiple years.\nChris Kuntarich: Understood. And maybe just going back to the non-gaming business, I think it's been positioned in the past, there was a bit of a lag between the adoption of AXON 2 from gaming and non-gaming and just the scaling of budgets here within the non-gaming business once those advertisers adopt AXON 2. Can you just talk about, kind of, if that slowness to scale budgets within that non-gaming business if you guys are starting to see that normalize and start to kind of revert to what you're seeing in your gaming business? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, it's a good question. Non-gaming we'll probably never get to as quick as mobile gaming. The mobile gaming marketer sees an opportunity and jumps on it. It's just that it tends to be a more commoditized space, and it's a tougher space for content providers to plan, whereas non-gaming enterprises tend to have a brand and they have fixed budgets and they normally plan their budgets in every quarters and years out. And so because of that, it won't ever be a quick to move market, that said, we talked about it growing faster than the gaming segment. We do know the technology application works across any category that we've seen so far. So as we get a fintech advertiser live, or a rentals company or an e-commerce company, we're seeing success across the board. So it's an area we're investing in. We're increasing our head count there. Now we always operate efficiently and lean. So that doesn't mean a lot of cost, but we are investing in bringing in the right people to really expand these non-gaming verticals because we see a ton of opportunity there.\nChris Kuntarich: Okay. And maybe just one housekeeping, if I can squeeze it in. I think you had called out the Software segment outperformance in 4Q, you listed off a handful of factors. I think it started with a strong market and wrapped up with growth in advertiser budgets. Should we be directionally or kind of if we were to stack rank these various impacts? Is that kind of from most impactful to least impactful? Or anything to read into there? Thanks.\nMatt Stumpf: No, they're not rank ordered, my list of factors. Yes, it's just a combination.\nAdam Foroughi: And I'd say, just given the growth rate we're on, and you've seen for multiple quarters now, the bigger part of our growth is driving more efficient value to advertisers, unlocking more budget and expanding the advertiser total than it is the market. The market isn't growing anywhere near as fast as what we are.\nChris Kuntarich: Understood. Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Well, this does conclude our question-and-answer session for the quarter. We thank you all for joining us today. Have a good afternoon. We'll see you next time.\nMatt Stumpf: Thanks, everyone.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining. We're thrilled to report another outstanding quarter in Q4. We surpassed the high-end of our guidance and established a consistent pattern of exceptional performance throughout 2023. Reflecting on the last year, it's remarkable to consider how much we have grown and evolved in just one year. After a challenging 2022 characterized by stagnant growth, we refocused on growing our existing business and investing in new initiatives. I am immensely proud of our team's dedication and hard work, which has resulted in our software platform revenue growing by 76% in 2023. Despite a challenged economic landscape and mobile gaming sector, we have continued to grow. This is a clear testament to the strength and potential of the updates we have made to our AI advertising engine, AXON. When we embarked on our public journey in 2021, Software Platform revenue was nearly $700 million. And now, only two years later, we have reached close to $2 billion. We also forecast that we would have significant margins on incremental revenue for our software business. I'm proud to state that in Q4 2023, our incremental revenue had an approximate 80% flow through to adjusted EBITDA, culminating in record cash flows. This growth trajectory underscores a robust financial health and positions us favorably for diverse opportunities to enhance shareholder value, like ongoing share repurchases. Now, looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, we continue to remain bullish about the potential of our core AI technologies, which stand amongst the most advanced across all markets. Our focus on leveraging these technologies for World in the CTV space and Array in the Carrier & OEM market is just the beginning. We are poised to explore and expand into new applications of our AI technologies in the coming quarters and years, which has the potential to significantly broaden our TAM and opportunities. Now, I'll turn it over to Matt, who will deliver his first financial summary as our CFO. We are incredibly fortunate to have him in this role. Thank you once again for your unwavering support on this journey. Thanks, Omar. I'll start with the business side, and then Matt will jump into the financials. But ultimately, we launched AXON 2, the upgrade of our AI platform in Q2 last year. From that point to Q4, the business -- the software business grew almost 50%. And obviously, you know, the impact on margins. We've talked about a huge flow through in dollars. The incremental dollars of growth there coming in at 80% roughly in the quarter. This is an early-stage technology. It's only been live for a little over half a year. It's growing exceptionally quickly, very high margin. We think the applications of this core technology are much broader than what we do today. And the team is continuously improving the technology, too. So we're very excited about where it could go. Ultimately, when you've got a business that's growing that quickly on a technology that's that new at the margins we operate at, it's very hard to understand going forward exactly where we're going to land, but we've never been more excited about the growth prospects we've got in front of us. No, we don't have any specific concentration or change of mix, and we index lower in terms of Chinese partners to rest the world than I think they do. But this is something we'd called out during COVID. China lockdown was a huge area of inefficiency in the market. So we've seen the market really hit a trough last year, or two years ago, and then start recovering late last year. A lot of that was because Chinese developers were back in office for a year, coming back online, getting efficient again. And we'd signaled that we thought eventually that's going to help bring efficiency back to the market, because while we don't index heavily on the revenue side, there is a lot of content that's created out of China that comes out West and does benefit advertising-related businesses. And so that was a good trend that we've seen continue to expand. Thanks, Omar. Yes, we got you, Tim. Yes. Look, I think we've said this before, when it comes to privacy, Tim, is you don't know dates on a lot of these releases. So when you're talking about Google, like, who knows when the actual rollout will be. Cookies were a lot later than expected and still in a very small percentage rollout. So we don't know when these changes will come. We don't know the exact impact of the changes. What we do know is that, one, the way we've operated traditionally, we're very entrepreneurial, we're very nimble, and we've been able to adapt very well whenever there have been these changes. And number two, we run a much more of a contextual behavioral model than a lot of properties on the OpenWeb. And so, because we don't interface as much when it comes to really sensitive user data with the consumer, we're in a much better starting point than a lot of other businesses, too. So those two things always give us confidence that no matter what the change is, we're going to be able to navigate it. Yes, the way Apple responded makes it not really a great business decision to go off store, because one thing people don't talk about is there is organic value to being on store. So if you take the 30% fee and figure 10 points to 15 points of value from organic rank, then you're down to 15 points of cost savings and the expense to the developer that they -- all the different layers of expense amounted to roughly 20 points. So there's no economic reason to go off-store today. We think over time, though, there's enough global pressure and there's going to be enough movement from the courts over time that they're going to continue to scrutinize us in different jurisdictions where eventually we think there could be benefits economically to the content developers. And if that happens, we've always said that's going to greatly benefit the advertising solutions. If you just think about the dollars on our platform, majority are transacted to drive IAP today and the dollar is taxed down to $0.70. If that one day went to [85-15] (ph), you could go take that and say every developer now makes 20% more, and how much of that are they going to be willing to put into marketing? A large part of it, which would be greatly beneficial to a platform like ours. Yes. Yes. And we just did authorize the big buyback. We're going to be committed to it going forward. We do think as a company like ours, where we're generating this much cash flow, we should be able to continue to facilitate buybacks and return value to shareholders in that manner. When it comes to the question of where we trade, why we trade at the certain multiple we trade at, but we can't answer that. We're not traders, and it's very hard to unpack. Does mobile gaming discount the overall company valuation? We don't, frankly believe so, because the core software business is growing so quickly and we break out financials. So it's pretty easy to just say, let's just look at the software segment. There is -- we think the harder part when it comes to our business is that we were in a no-growth period in '22. We've had to come off of that and really focus on execution, which is what we asked of our teams. And now we put together four subsequent quarters of stellar performance. And as you look at that software segment, there's not a lot of software businesses with 70% plus EBITDA margin growing at the rate that is, I mean, rule of 140, 150 or whatever. And so, it's just an astounding number. And then we convert a very high percentage of that EBITDA to cash flow as well. So we think because the technologies are new, it'll take a while for investors to understand what we already see, which is not only is this very powerful technology in our core market, we've been able to grow much greater than the market is growing because this technology is efficient. And in conjunction with that, our partners are growing much faster, too. And you see some of these games that are in the market today at the top of the top grossing, they depend on our marketing channel, and they're growing because our solutions become more efficient. That's in our core market. And now we see applications of that technology in multiple adjacent markets, and we think we're going to be able to go apply it, not only to what we've talked about some other applications too, that we'll talk about in the upcoming quarters. And that's what gets us really excited. So we're for sure committed to buybacks because we see value and we're able to unpack the value much more easily today than investors are. And we hope to be able to articulate that narrative in the coming quarters to investors. Yes. Thanks, Ralph. Non-gaming is growing faster. Gaming, it's smaller, so obviously there's more room to grow. It's going to be a commitment of ours to broaden out the platform. We've talked about broadening out to non-gaming, that's a component. We've talked about Connected TV. That was an application that's in progress right now, expanding our reach to the television device.

And by delivering an advertisement more quickly, the publisher benefits because they can show more advertisements to their consumer whenever they want to, instead of waiting for an advertisement to actually clear, it clears faster and more show. By doing that, it creates a world where the publisher starts yielding more in an efficient manner which can then drive up their ad revenue per user. And then the whole formula that we operate on is the publisher makes more, they reinvest more in the user acquisition, their business grows, and we enable that growth, and our business grows with it. So we're only seeing positive from this transition. Look, since we went public, we've been a very strong independent leader in the sector. I don't think anything has changed there. We've been focused on executing ourselves. And as our technology has gotten more efficient. Obviously, we're driving more value to advertisers. But we've said this for, I think, multiple quarters now, none of us operate in a zero-sum game. So when we're able to drive more value to these advertisers who are buying on a performance basis, they don't go, we have a fixed budget and we're going to pull from here. They go, okay, we have a budget over here. We have budget over here. But AppLovin is now 5 times better than they were. So let's expand the budget with them, too. And they're able to reinvest more dollars into the user acquisition, which helps their businesses grow. And that's what makes the space quite appealing is that none of it is zero sum, whether on the publisher or the advertiser side. And so we've been able to focus heads down on our own execution. Our team has built really cutting-edge technology that works better than any other -- I think any of the advertisers or our peers have seen in the sector, but that benefits everyone in the sector. And so we're excited that, that is just a reality of the industry we're in. I'll have Matt cover two and three. On the first one, on the mobile market, we put out a blog. I think it was around Thanksgiving. So it was a good one, highlighting just CPM growth in the industry, comparing '23 to '22 holiday period. And what we saw in Q4 was that just coming off of weak comps in '22 when every part of the economy was fearful and this sector was particularly fearful we saw brands and performance advertisers more willing to invest in marketing dollars. Now what we don't know about that is are the AI-driven advancements in the marketing technologies that you've seen implied by our numbers and our performance and technology and what Facebook has done and what Google have done over the last year driven that acceleration? Or is it just the economy recovering? And we think it's a function of both. And we actually think because we're not brand advertising at all. Ours is entirely due to the technology efficiency, you're seeing this market start recovering. It's coming off from weak comps. So getting back to growth is easier than it was in the past. But the marketing technology is evolving from here and continuing to improve is going to be a really good catalyst for a return to growth for this mobile market. Look, the CTV testing and the rollout is early stage. And we've got a really large software platform business now with net revenue near $2 billion. So for it to become very substantial for these advertisers as the ways out, they're all intrigued by it because traditionally, and I don't know if you do channel checks, you won't find another place where these advertisers can buy on a performance basis, the way we can enable it on Connected TV today. So I'd say it's first inning, everyone is excited by prospect of being able to go recruit a consumer on a new device that they just had never had the access to before in the way that we can enable it but it's early and in our business as big as we are and as fast growing as that business is for any new initiative to make a material impact, we're talking multiple years. Yes, it's a good question. Non-gaming we'll probably never get to as quick as mobile gaming. The mobile gaming marketer sees an opportunity and jumps on it. It's just that it tends to be a more commoditized space, and it's a tougher space for content providers to plan, whereas non-gaming enterprises tend to have a brand and they have fixed budgets and they normally plan their budgets in every quarters and years out. And so because of that, it won't ever be a quick to move market, that said, we talked about it growing faster than the gaming segment. We do know the technology application works across any category that we've seen so far. So as we get a fintech advertiser live, or a rentals company or an e-commerce company, we're seeing success across the board. So it's an area we're investing in. We're increasing our head count there. Now we always operate efficiently and lean. So that doesn't mean a lot of cost, but we are investing in bringing in the right people to really expand these non-gaming verticals because we see a ton of opportunity there. And I'd say, just given the growth rate we're on, and you've seen for multiple quarters now, the bigger part of our growth is driving more efficient value to advertisers, unlocking more budget and expanding the advertiser total than it is the market. The market isn't growing anywhere near as fast as what we are. Thanks, Chris. Thanks."

            "name": "Matt Stumpf",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to step into my first earnings release as CFO with such amazing financial results. So first, I'd like to thank the team for having executed so well this quarter and making my job easy. In the fourth quarter, we exceeded the high end of our guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, achieving $953 million in total revenue and $476 million in adjusted EBITDA. That's an impressive 50% adjusted EBITDA margin. We also exceeded our analyst expectations this quarter by beating the consensus averages for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly 10% higher than expectations. Our revenue grew by 36% from the same period last year and 10% from last quarter. Optimization efforts within our Apps business in the first-half of the year resulted in a slight decline in revenue, but it led to improved EBITDA margin. We still grew revenue every quarter this year due to the tremendous performance of our software platform and continued strength and growth in the advertising market. Our Apps portfolio continues to perform well with 5% growth from last quarter, while maintaining a consistent 15% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Software Platform had another excellent quarter. We achieved a revenue of $576 million and adjusted EBITDA of $420 million, that's a 73% margin. This represents nearly an 80% flow through from revenue, given our relatively fixed cost base and continued cost discipline. All of our businesses were able to grow their revenue this quarter, with AppDiscovery, the primary driver of our success. Our growth stemmed from a combination of market factors and our execution, including a strong holiday season, growth in the mobile advertising market, a market shift to real-time bidding, early contributions from our Array business, enhancement of our technologies like AXON, expansion of our advertiser base, and growth in advertiser budgets. The combination of these factors are contributing to improved efficiency, leading to compounding growth for our company and our partners in the industry. Turning briefly to our annual results. Revenue for the year was $3.3 billion, that's an increase of 17% from last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, that's an incredible 41% increase from last year at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. Over the last five years, we've been able to achieve remarkable growth in our Software Platform business. We grew from $136 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2019 to nearly $1.3 billion this year. During that time, we had roughly 60% to 70% adjusted EBITDA margin. Free cash flow for the year was $1 billion, representing an impressive 69% flow through from adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Going forward, we hope to retain roughly 70% flow through on an annual basis, with quarterly fluctuations due to working capital and tax payments. During the year, we extended the maturity of our term loan to 2030. At the same time, reducing our interest rate to continue to manage our ongoing costs. In addition to our debt management activities this year, we also repurchased and withheld a combined 54.3 million shares in 2023. After considering share compensation, this represents a nearly 10% reduction in our total shares outstanding. Through the combination of free cash flow generation and share management, we hope to continue to generate significant long-term value for our existing and our new shareholders. Our Board has also approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. We plan to use this to continue to manage our outstanding shares. Turning to our first quarter 2024 guidance, we hope to deliver between $955 million and $975 million in revenue in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within the range of $475 million and $495 million. That represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 50% and 51%. We believe these results are achievable, given the various growth factors I highlighted earlier. While taking into account, the first quarter is a seasonally low period for the industry. In conclusion, we're very happy with our financial performance this quarter and for all of 2023, as a result of a strengthening market combined with our team's execution. We look forward to continued growth over the coming year as we continue to expand our business into new verticals and industries such as non-gaming and CTV. Now with that, I'll hand it over to our moderator to take us through the Q&A. Yes. Just to echo what Adam said, Omar, given the difficulty in kind of forecasting and understanding the impact of launching a new technology like we did with AXON 2.0, it's very difficult for us to forecast what the impact, what the financial impact of that is. So for that reason, we don't provide longer-term guidance. Yes, I'll take the buyback piece first. So, Jason, just from a strategic view, our approach to doing buybacks is to do directed large repurchases rather than buyback in the open market. That's how we feel like we can have the most impact. And the opportunity didn't present itself in Q4 to do a large buyback from an existing shareholder. So to the extent that, that does present itself in the future, that's the approach that we're going to take. And on your second question, Vasily, in terms of just margin. We haven't seen any significant difference. I mean, as Adam mentioned previously, it's relatively small at this point, the non-gaming component of the business. But as we push into these other new verticals and industries, we don't see any material difference between the margin profiles of the existing mobile gaming business or non-gaming. Yes. I mean if you look at just our guidance, Vasily, we're guiding to a similar position, right, in the 50% to 51% overall EBITDA margin. You're welcome. Thank you. Yes. In terms of free cash flow, David, so we didn't guide to 70% going forward on a long-term basis. On a quarterly basis, we will have fluctuations depending upon just working capital and then also the timing of tax payments. But we are seeing better free cash flow conversion from EBITDA than we were expecting, which is a positive impact that we're seeing from all the technology improvements that we've done. And then in terms of the Q1 guide, your last question, Obviously, we don't provide segment guidance, so I won't comment on apps versus software, but we are happy to be able to guide into Q1 with slight growth considering the fact that it is a seasonally low period for the advertising market. No, they're not rank ordered, my list of factors. Yes, it's just a combination. Thanks, everyone."

        "content": "David Hsiao: Welcome, everyone, to the AppLovin Earnings Call for the Third Quarter ended September 30, 2023. I\u2019m David Hsiao, Head of Investor Relations. Joining me today to discuss our results are Adam Foroughi, our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson; and Herald Chen, our President and CFO. Please note, our SEC filings to date as well as our shareholder letter and press release discussing our third quarter performance are available at investors.applovin.com. During today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our products and services, market expectations, our CFO transition, the future financial performance of the company and other future events. These statements are based on our current assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them except as required by law. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, and our Form 10-Q for the third quarter, which we expect to file later today. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. Please be sure to review the reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our shareholder letter available on our Investor Relations site. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our IR website. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Adam and Herald for some opening remarks, then we\u2019ll have the moderator take us through Q&A.\nAdam Foroughi: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. Our team has executed exceptionally well. This quarter\u2019s record-breaking performance is a testament to the success of our new AI-based advertising technology, AXON 2, which has once again driven revenue and adjusted EBITDA above our expectations. I would like to take a moment to commend our outstanding team for their dedication and hard work. A year ago, we faced significant challenges, yet our teams resolve and enthusiasm never faltered. Our efforts this year have not only solidified our short-term growth trajectory but have also set the stage for sustained long-term expansion. The journey with AXON 2 is just beginning with numerous enhancements on the horizon. This quarter, we made strides by integrating AXON 2 into our CTV initiative during its testing phase, and we are planning to scale up these efforts in the subsequent quarters. We are excited about introducing our leading performance marketing technologies to television, where we see a substantial opportunity to fill a gap with the superior performance solution. Additionally, this quarter, we\u2019ll be extending AXON 2 to Array and expect it will materially accelerate the potential to scale that business. Considering the magnitude of our software platform business, we\u2019re investing in our CTV and Array businesses because we believe they have the potential to become meaningful contributors to our annual revenue. Our dedication to creating long-term value for our shareholders is steadfast. We are confident in the capabilities of our team, the potential for the innovation of our technology, the quality of our products and the strength of our financial position. We are grateful for your trust and support as we embark on the next chapter of our journey, which promises growth and relentless innovation. Before concluding, I would like to express my gratitude to Herald for his many contributions during his tenure as CFO over the past 4 years. Herald\u2019s ambition to build a strong foundation in our support and operational functions has been realized, setting us on a course for operational excellence. As we transition to provide more opportunities for his team, Herald will continue to offer invaluable strategic guidance in his new advisory role to me. I will now turn it to Herald who will share the financial highlights of the quarter. Thank you again for your continued support.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam, and thanks for the kind words. As Adam discussed, strong execution across the board led to fantastic financial performance this past quarter. In Q3, we achieved incredible year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, with software platform up 65% year-over-year reaching a $2 billion run rate. Apps posted the first quarter of quarter-over-quarter revenue growth since we started our portfolio optimization program. In total, generated revenue of $864 million, up 21% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA of $490 million, up 63% year-over-year, both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Given higher margins and higher contribution from our software platform business, total adjusted EBITDA reached the highest EBITDA margin in 5 years at 48.5% margin, an improvement quarter-over-quarter of over 400 basis points on top of a 600 basis points improvement from Q2 over Q1 2023. Of note, this past quarter did benefit from approximately 100 basis points of improvement coming from onetime nonrecurring cost benefits. Turning to our segment reporting. We are excited to see our software platform and AI-driven technologies to help our advertising partners expand the reach, achieve better returns on their investments and increase their spending with us. The software platform reached record revenue of $504 million, a 65% increase over the prior year and a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter, which is the third consecutive quarter with double-digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 91% year-over-year and 33% quarter-over-quarter to $364 million, with a record 72% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our software platform continues to demonstrate high flow-through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA as we scale. Given its extraordinary growth in cash flow generation, software platform adjusted EBITDA now represents nearly 90% of our company\u2019s total adjusted EBITDA. As Adam mentioned, we\u2019re very proud of our software platform team\u2019s hard work and accomplishments to date but we\u2019re even more excited about where this business can go in the future, both within our core markets and within the new initiatives we have been pursuing with Wurl and Array. Moving on to the App segment, apps revenue grew 5% sequentially to $360 million, the first quarter of growth since we started our portfolio optimization project. Apps adjusted EBITDA was $55 million, a margin of 15%. With the major parts of our portfolio review complete, we are continuing to focus on balancing growth and cash flow to optimize the financial performance and enterprise value of our apps portfolio. With regard to free cash flow, we generated $194 million in Q3. The flow-through from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow in Q3 is slightly lower than normal, primarily due to a temporary delay in certain cash collections which we expect will reverse itself in Q4. As previously mentioned in our calls, adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow flow-through is typically 50% to 60% on a normalized run rate basis, noting that we typically have some deviations in any particular quarter driven by the timing of tax payments and working capital movements. This flow-through percentage should increase over time as our high cash flow converting software platform business continues to grow faster than the apps. With regard to guidance for Q4 2023, we are targeting another quarter of growth with revenue between $910 million and $930 million, adjusted EBITDA between $420 million and $440 million and margin between 46% and 47%. Margin outlook is slightly down from Q3\u2019s 48.5% given an approximately 100 basis point benefit from onetime items in Q3 and the potential for further investments in the business in Q4. From a cash perspective, we ended Q3 with $332 million of cash in the balance sheet. In the quarter, we used $582 million of cash to buy back stock and $249 million to pay down our term loan. This was offset by $185 million drawn on the revolver. Regarding stock buybacks. Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased $1.2 billion of our Class A common stock at a weighted average price of under $25 per share. This is consistent with our asset allocation plan and focus on driving long-term shareholder value. On the debt side, in Q3, we amended a portion of our term loans, extending the maturity to 2030, reducing principal amount by $250 million -- $249 million and improving our credit spread. With regard to our Board, we\u2019re pleased to add Todd Morgenfeld in the quarter, a seasoned executive who most recently was a CFO at Pinterest and prior to that, was VP Finance at Twitter. Concurrently, Asha Sharma, COO of Instacart, stepped down from the Board. Overall, our strong Q3 performance showcases the strength and powerful business model underlying our software platform business. Lastly, on a personal note, as Adam mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve decided to transition from a full-time role to an advisory one at the end of this year so I can take some time off and investigate new opportunities. In my new role as adviser to the CEO, I very much look forward to working with Adam and the team on key strategic and financial matters. Further, I will be continuing my service on the AppLovin Board. It has been my privilege to serve as AppLovin President and CFO for the past 4 years, in particular, getting to help build and work with this truly extraordinary management team. Come January, I\u2019m excited to have Matt and Dimitri step into their new and well-deserved leadership roles. Based on their track record and past contributions, I am confident in their success. Since joining the Board in 2018, under Adam\u2019s leadership, the company has achieved tremendous growth, increasing revenues by over 6x and adjusted EBITDA as multiplied from a couple of hundred million dollars of run rate to over $1.6 billion run rate today. While the path has not always been linear, nor easy, the team has remained steadfast and executed with expertise to drive this outstanding performance. Thank you to all the AppLovin stakeholders, including our team, customers, partners, shareholders, lenders and Board who have supported us along our journey thus far. I do say thus far because the opportunity ahead of AppLovin is awesome and I very much look forward to being a part of it in my new role. Now the moderator will take us through Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Ralph Schackart with William Blair.\nRalph Schackart: First question, just on the overperformance in the quarter. Maybe you could kind of speak to maybe what\u2019s going better with the sort of ramp of EXON 2 than you originally anticipated. And perhaps maybe you could kind of touch on, I think, historically, you talked about it extended beyond gaming, maybe some perspective on how it\u2019s doing in some of the other verticals? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nAdam Foroughi: So we talked about last quarter, AXON 2 was rolled out partial way in the prior quarter. This is a brand-new technology, and it\u2019s a self-learning type of technology. These AI models as they get scaled, continuously improve themselves. And then our team also is able to continuously improve them. So we\u2019re talking about a new technology that we\u2019ve seen is one, been game changing for our business and is too in the first inning. And that\u2019s what gets us really excited. The output of the technology delivers better results for advertisers. And we\u2019ve seen it to your question on gaming or non-gaming, we\u2019ve seen it agnostic of the category. Advertisers on our platform are spending more dollars in a material way at better returns. And that is a model that just compounds on itself. And so that\u2019s what led to the vast majority of the over performance this past quarter. It works much better for both non-gaming and gaming.\nRalph Schackart: And then during the prepared remarks, Adam, you talked about extending EXON 2 to the Connected-TV business and Array and then, will at some point, contribute to results. Just kind of carry some perspective in your opinion, when it can start adding to the overall, sort of, enterprise results?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. I mean we did the World deal, I think it was last April, right? So it\u2019s been about 1.5 years. World teams integrated, they\u2019ve built out really good product offerings on Connected-TV, part of that is an SSP. So there\u2019s a lot of inventory available on World\u2019s platform now for us to step into it and buy it with our performance marketing model. And in the last earnings call, we talked about we\u2019re just going to start migrating AXON 2 over to the Connected-TV offering. We\u2019ve gotten the testing phase on that. As we start scaling that, we\u2019re very excited about the potential of that platform. Obviously, it\u2019s television, and we all also know that performance marketing on TV hasn\u2019t really been thing anywhere near as much as it has been on desktop or on mobile devices. And so our technology is truly cutting-edge and being able to extend into that platform presents a very big opportunity. And then Array is the same deal, Array, gets us on Android devices today in a much more intimate way. It presents multiple new ad offerings to the consumer and being able to use the AXON 2 solution there. We think is also going to be game changing for that business and the prospects of both.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Clark Lampen with BTIG.\nClark Lampen: Adam, I was hoping maybe we could unpack a little bit of the sort of sequential uplift that we saw in software revenue. You talked about it being a testament to AXON 2 at the top of your prepared remarks. Was that the key driver in the sort of lift we saw up to $500 million? Or were there other businesses like World or maybe MAX also contributing?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes, that\u2019s vast majority of AXON 2. That powers the App Discovery platform or advertising business, and that\u2019s already the vast majority of the software platform, but AXON 2 is the key catalyst.\nClark Lampen: Got it. And as we look at, I guess, sort of the forward guidance, if you were to assume I guess just for discussions sake that the apps business is running flat. We\u2019re sort of seeing like a 9% to 13% uptick in software revenue into the fourth quarter. Is that still expected to be mostly driven by app discovery, AXON, sort of the compounding effect of the improvements that you\u2019ve talked about historically?\nHerald Chen: Yes, we see both sides of the business growing. As we mentioned, we\u2019ve had the first quarter of growth, quarter-over-quarter growth in the app since we started our portfolio optimization program. But clearly, the vast majority of growth will remain in the software side as well as translation if we were able to grow that business translation to EBITDA. EBITDA as we mentioned, there\u2019s some onetime items in the third quarter that will come out in the fourth quarter. And then the fourth quarter, we are considering some additional investments on the growth side, both on the software and app side.\nClark Lampen: And I\u2019ll step away really quick in just a second, but any uplift that you guys were seeing from sort of non-gaming customers this quarter also? Or was this mostly your sort of core game developers base that was driving most of the improvement we\u2019re seeing?\nAdam Foroughi: No, what we\u2019re seeing success at cost, both gaming and non-gaming. Obviously, gaming is a much bigger part of our business. Non-gaming is growing faster because the number that is starting out is materially smaller. It will take a sales effort to substantially grow non-gaming so that it can become a much more material part of the business, but the technology works very effectively regardless of the type of app on dealers.\nOperator: [Indiscernible] with Wolfe has the next question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just very briefly a high-level question. How far ahead is AXON 2\u2019s advantage versus competitors? How long does this persist before competitors maybe catch up? And following up on that, how should we think about the pace of new releases? What that kind of becomes for you guys? And when should we expect like an AXON 3? How much the new requirements and changes in privacy in the ad market drive that new release desire versus, say, competitors improving their competitive positioning against you?\nAdam Foroughi: So there\u2019s a bunch of questions in there. Look, these technologies are super complicated. We think ours is cutting edge and one of the leading AI solutions in the market across any of the AI implementations we\u2019ve seen. We have very large deployment of software and hardware to power it, and we\u2019ve got a material amount of data. These systems themselves, they said, are self-learning. And we\u2019re continuing to evolve what we have on an ongoing basis on a regular basis. So this isn\u2019t something where we look at competition catching up. We look at -- we\u2019ve set a new standard, and we\u2019re going to go build on that and that hopefully will lead to many quarters of growth coming up. the privacy question that leading to AXON 3 year changes in the platform. Look, we\u2019ve dealt with privacy changes probably since 2014. Every time there\u2019s a change on platform or with regulators, you\u2019ve changed something in your stock, but we\u2019re a nimble company, we\u2019ve rewritten our core technology multiple times over the years, and we are always able to adapt and perform in the face of any of those kinds of changes. And as far as AXON 3 goes, we signaled AXON 2 to you all a year ago. We\u2019ve obviously executed really well on putting it together. We\u2019re not talking about AXON 3. We\u2019re talking about a lot of excitement about multiple quarters of growth coming up from what we put together here.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Franco Granda with D.A. Davidson.\nFranco Granda: I had a question around the investments on CTV and OEM. Obviously, last year, you put those investments in cost then on Essentials and these were some areas that suffered. But now that you\u2019re planning on implementing AXON into those categories, can you comment on perhaps the magnitude of this investment and how we should think about those moving forward?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. I mean I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever put them on pause. We\u2019ve been talking about CTV since we acquired World and Array. We launched, I think, a couple of years ago, and we\u2019ve signaled to you all that these are a couple of the growth vectors that we\u2019re really excited about. Our software business, obviously, is really big. We\u2019re in a $2 billion a year run rate. So to have the type of numbers and scale from a new initiative, to put a real big debt on those numbers, it takes a while. But we\u2019re very excited about CTV and Array. The foundation is there on both those businesses. And by taking this market-leading technology, applying it to it, we think we\u2019re going to be able to really accelerate the path of both.\nFranco Granda: And then just very quickly here on the apps business growth based on the quarter, how much of that growth came from perhaps your integration with Axon and leveraging that technology for the UA capabilities there?\nHerald Chen: Yes. We\u2019re obviously a big customer of our own systems. And we -- when we saw AXON 2 in it\u2019s performance, like a lot of our customers we invested more in UA, and we expect to continue to do that rolling into the fourth quarter. So that was a big driver of growth.\nOperator: And moving on to Martin Yang with OpCo.\nMartin Yang: A question on the share between non-gaming and gaming for software platform. Can you first talk about the general trend on the revenue contribution from non-gaming apps? And then did AXON 2 help either direction of the non-gaming share of revenues to software platforms?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. We don\u2019t break down the percentages, but we\u2019ve talked about a majority of our business is gaming. And then I referenced that this technology is working really well for advertisers of any kind, across every category of mobile application. So we\u2019re seeing quite a bit of growth across all, but non-gaming starts from a smaller place. So we\u2019re actually seeing accelerated growth on non-gaming advertisers.\nOperator: And moving on to Ross Compton with Macquarie.\nUnidentified Analyst: Looking at the gross margin last year, and then 4Q \u201822, this was 47%. And most recently in 3Q, you guys approached at 69%. I was wondering if you could expand on the processes that have kind of led us here and how we should think about this into 4Q and beyond? Is there a ceiling? Scale, of course, helps longly improve billing technology with AXON, but any kind of understanding on the operating leverage in the model would be great.\nHerald Chen: Yes, some of the question was breaking up. But I think you\u2019re asking about the gross margin on software and just the improvement year-over-year. Is that correct?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes.\nHerald Chen: Our business model on the software side, first of all, as you know, we report on a net revenue basis, so we start at that level in the P&L. And then in terms of the cost structure itself, that\u2019s directly related to software. A lot of it is the data center infrastructure that we talked about almost a year ago that we had a big new contract that we needed to get to initial amount of initial scale. And so we had to grow into that. I\u2019d say now we\u2019re very much on pace if not growing through some of that contract and so fully utilizing the capacity that we\u2019ve had on board. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to really expand gross margin all the way through to EBITDA given a relatively fixed cost structure on the R&D front.\nOperator: Morgan Stanley\u2019s Matt Cost has the next question.\nMatt Cost: I guess the first one would just be, there were some media reports in September and October of some advertisers boycotting one of your largest competitors are pulling back spend. Did you see any material impact on your business in the third quarter? Or do you expect any business -- any impact along the lines in the fourth quarter?\nAdam Foroughi: It was a little overblown in the media, pretty negligible impact. It was late September to maybe a week or 2 of noise in the market but negligible to ours.\nMatt Cost: Great. And then just on the software platform margins, 72%, a very, very strong result. I guess can you give us your latest thoughts on what the flow-through at scale potential is for that business because we\u2019re higher than we\u2019ve been certainly in a while.\nHerald Chen: Yes. Good question, Matt. And again, there\u2019s -- every quarter, there\u2019s going to be some bigger reason as to if there\u2019s some fixed cost, incremental cost, step function costs, in particular, on the data center side. But we expect, as I said, R&D to be relatively stable and that software margin can grow and expand as we continue to grow app discovery in particular because that is a net revenue business. Over time, looking at more of the longer run as we scale Worlds, we scale CTV -- sorry, is rescaled the OEM side on Array, we\u2019ll likely need to make some fixed investments in those businesses and hire some teams, but those are also strong margin businesses as they scale up as well, but unlikely to start as high as the contribution that we do get from app discovery.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Omar Dessouky with BofA.\nOmar Dessouky: So you guys talked about header bidding and how Google is going to shift to header bidding demand. Shift demand 100% to header bidding. They put out a notice on their website recently that they won\u2019t be shifting entirely after October 31, but we\u2019ll do so partially and expect that transition to happen into the first quarter of next year. So I think you mentioned that your mediation platform can tax the Google demand. And what I was wondering was actually, given that Google has been waterfall bidder for so long and app discovery has been a real-time bidder for so long. Does Google shift to real-time bidding actually post competition to your core business because we tended to focus on the idea that you could tax demand from Google doing real-time bidding, but what about the competitive sector of Google?\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. So you\u2019re talking about cannibalization effect of a mediation network, one as big as Google, in particular, going to bidding. We\u2019ve taken most of the market to bidding at this point, and we\u2019re already above, I think, 60% once Google goes to bidding is going to be very close to the full market tipping that way. On every network that\u2019s mediated going to bidding, share moves around only slightly and possibly the bidder gets more efficient, so it can gain share, but the overall pie grows. And so that\u2019s the whole point of the MAX platform is our objective with that platform was building an efficient marketplace where you bring these networks and put them into the most efficient way possible to serve price and serve an ad a header bidding state, and then the publisher yields more. The publisher yields more so they can spend more on user acquisition. We\u2019re obviously one of their main user acquisition channels, dollars go back into the ecosystem, the pie grows. And usually, all parties end up benefiting and that\u2019s the trend we\u2019ve seen now for 5 to 6 years since we launched the MAX platform.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. So if I understood correctly, then, it sounds like you\u2019re saying the benefit of Google moving to real-time bidding is to make the entire industry bigger, and that will outweigh any potential competition because you have a new technology in the market from someone other than yourself, which could potentially experience increases in ad spend.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. Look, we never look at share. It\u2019s not a zero-sum game. You need all the marketing companies to do well. That helps the ecosystem grow, user acquisition, dollars come into the space more, eyeballs swell, consumption goes up. That\u2019s always been our formula to growth. So we look at dollars and the dollars become bigger, it benefits all parties. And that\u2019s what we see every time a network goes to bidding.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today\u2019s earnings. We thank you all for attending, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care until next time, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. Our team has executed exceptionally well. This quarter\u2019s record-breaking performance is a testament to the success of our new AI-based advertising technology, AXON 2, which has once again driven revenue and adjusted EBITDA above our expectations. I would like to take a moment to commend our outstanding team for their dedication and hard work. A year ago, we faced significant challenges, yet our teams resolve and enthusiasm never faltered. Our efforts this year have not only solidified our short-term growth trajectory but have also set the stage for sustained long-term expansion. The journey with AXON 2 is just beginning with numerous enhancements on the horizon. This quarter, we made strides by integrating AXON 2 into our CTV initiative during its testing phase, and we are planning to scale up these efforts in the subsequent quarters. We are excited about introducing our leading performance marketing technologies to television, where we see a substantial opportunity to fill a gap with the superior performance solution. Additionally, this quarter, we\u2019ll be extending AXON 2 to Array and expect it will materially accelerate the potential to scale that business. Considering the magnitude of our software platform business, we\u2019re investing in our CTV and Array businesses because we believe they have the potential to become meaningful contributors to our annual revenue. Our dedication to creating long-term value for our shareholders is steadfast. We are confident in the capabilities of our team, the potential for the innovation of our technology, the quality of our products and the strength of our financial position. We are grateful for your trust and support as we embark on the next chapter of our journey, which promises growth and relentless innovation. Before concluding, I would like to express my gratitude to Herald for his many contributions during his tenure as CFO over the past 4 years. Herald\u2019s ambition to build a strong foundation in our support and operational functions has been realized, setting us on a course for operational excellence. As we transition to provide more opportunities for his team, Herald will continue to offer invaluable strategic guidance in his new advisory role to me. I will now turn it to Herald who will share the financial highlights of the quarter. Thank you again for your continued support. So we talked about last quarter, AXON 2 was rolled out partial way in the prior quarter. This is a brand-new technology, and it\u2019s a self-learning type of technology. These AI models as they get scaled, continuously improve themselves. And then our team also is able to continuously improve them. So we\u2019re talking about a new technology that we\u2019ve seen is one, been game changing for our business and is too in the first inning. And that\u2019s what gets us really excited. The output of the technology delivers better results for advertisers. And we\u2019ve seen it to your question on gaming or non-gaming, we\u2019ve seen it agnostic of the category. Advertisers on our platform are spending more dollars in a material way at better returns. And that is a model that just compounds on itself. And so that\u2019s what led to the vast majority of the over performance this past quarter. It works much better for both non-gaming and gaming. Yes. I mean we did the World deal, I think it was last April, right? So it\u2019s been about 1.5 years. World teams integrated, they\u2019ve built out really good product offerings on Connected-TV, part of that is an SSP. So there\u2019s a lot of inventory available on World\u2019s platform now for us to step into it and buy it with our performance marketing model. And in the last earnings call, we talked about we\u2019re just going to start migrating AXON 2 over to the Connected-TV offering. We\u2019ve gotten the testing phase on that. As we start scaling that, we\u2019re very excited about the potential of that platform. Obviously, it\u2019s television, and we all also know that performance marketing on TV hasn\u2019t really been thing anywhere near as much as it has been on desktop or on mobile devices. And so our technology is truly cutting-edge and being able to extend into that platform presents a very big opportunity. And then Array is the same deal, Array, gets us on Android devices today in a much more intimate way. It presents multiple new ad offerings to the consumer and being able to use the AXON 2 solution there. We think is also going to be game changing for that business and the prospects of both. Yes, that\u2019s vast majority of AXON 2. That powers the App Discovery platform or advertising business, and that\u2019s already the vast majority of the software platform, but AXON 2 is the key catalyst. No, what we\u2019re seeing success at cost, both gaming and non-gaming. Obviously, gaming is a much bigger part of our business. Non-gaming is growing faster because the number that is starting out is materially smaller. It will take a sales effort to substantially grow non-gaming so that it can become a much more material part of the business, but the technology works very effectively regardless of the type of app on dealers. So there\u2019s a bunch of questions in there. Look, these technologies are super complicated. We think ours is cutting edge and one of the leading AI solutions in the market across any of the AI implementations we\u2019ve seen. We have very large deployment of software and hardware to power it, and we\u2019ve got a material amount of data. These systems themselves, they said, are self-learning. And we\u2019re continuing to evolve what we have on an ongoing basis on a regular basis. So this isn\u2019t something where we look at competition catching up. We look at -- we\u2019ve set a new standard, and we\u2019re going to go build on that and that hopefully will lead to many quarters of growth coming up. the privacy question that leading to AXON 3 year changes in the platform. Look, we\u2019ve dealt with privacy changes probably since 2014. Every time there\u2019s a change on platform or with regulators, you\u2019ve changed something in your stock, but we\u2019re a nimble company, we\u2019ve rewritten our core technology multiple times over the years, and we are always able to adapt and perform in the face of any of those kinds of changes. And as far as AXON 3 goes, we signaled AXON 2 to you all a year ago. We\u2019ve obviously executed really well on putting it together. We\u2019re not talking about AXON 3. We\u2019re talking about a lot of excitement about multiple quarters of growth coming up from what we put together here. Yes. I mean I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever put them on pause. We\u2019ve been talking about CTV since we acquired World and Array. We launched, I think, a couple of years ago, and we\u2019ve signaled to you all that these are a couple of the growth vectors that we\u2019re really excited about. Our software business, obviously, is really big. We\u2019re in a $2 billion a year run rate. So to have the type of numbers and scale from a new initiative, to put a real big debt on those numbers, it takes a while. But we\u2019re very excited about CTV and Array. The foundation is there on both those businesses. And by taking this market-leading technology, applying it to it, we think we\u2019re going to be able to really accelerate the path of both. Yes. We don\u2019t break down the percentages, but we\u2019ve talked about a majority of our business is gaming. And then I referenced that this technology is working really well for advertisers of any kind, across every category of mobile application. So we\u2019re seeing quite a bit of growth across all, but non-gaming starts from a smaller place. So we\u2019re actually seeing accelerated growth on non-gaming advertisers. It was a little overblown in the media, pretty negligible impact. It was late September to maybe a week or 2 of noise in the market but negligible to ours. Yes. So you\u2019re talking about cannibalization effect of a mediation network, one as big as Google, in particular, going to bidding. We\u2019ve taken most of the market to bidding at this point, and we\u2019re already above, I think, 60% once Google goes to bidding is going to be very close to the full market tipping that way. On every network that\u2019s mediated going to bidding, share moves around only slightly and possibly the bidder gets more efficient, so it can gain share, but the overall pie grows. And so that\u2019s the whole point of the MAX platform is our objective with that platform was building an efficient marketplace where you bring these networks and put them into the most efficient way possible to serve price and serve an ad a header bidding state, and then the publisher yields more.

That\u2019s always been our formula to growth. So we look at dollars and the dollars become bigger, it benefits all parties. And that\u2019s what we see every time a network goes to bidding."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks for the kind words. As Adam discussed, strong execution across the board led to fantastic financial performance this past quarter. In Q3, we achieved incredible year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, with software platform up 65% year-over-year reaching a $2 billion run rate. Apps posted the first quarter of quarter-over-quarter revenue growth since we started our portfolio optimization program. In total, generated revenue of $864 million, up 21% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA of $490 million, up 63% year-over-year, both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Given higher margins and higher contribution from our software platform business, total adjusted EBITDA reached the highest EBITDA margin in 5 years at 48.5% margin, an improvement quarter-over-quarter of over 400 basis points on top of a 600 basis points improvement from Q2 over Q1 2023. Of note, this past quarter did benefit from approximately 100 basis points of improvement coming from onetime nonrecurring cost benefits. Turning to our segment reporting. We are excited to see our software platform and AI-driven technologies to help our advertising partners expand the reach, achieve better returns on their investments and increase their spending with us. The software platform reached record revenue of $504 million, a 65% increase over the prior year and a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter, which is the third consecutive quarter with double-digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 91% year-over-year and 33% quarter-over-quarter to $364 million, with a record 72% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our software platform continues to demonstrate high flow-through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA as we scale. Given its extraordinary growth in cash flow generation, software platform adjusted EBITDA now represents nearly 90% of our company\u2019s total adjusted EBITDA. As Adam mentioned, we\u2019re very proud of our software platform team\u2019s hard work and accomplishments to date but we\u2019re even more excited about where this business can go in the future, both within our core markets and within the new initiatives we have been pursuing with Wurl and Array. Moving on to the App segment, apps revenue grew 5% sequentially to $360 million, the first quarter of growth since we started our portfolio optimization project. Apps adjusted EBITDA was $55 million, a margin of 15%. With the major parts of our portfolio review complete, we are continuing to focus on balancing growth and cash flow to optimize the financial performance and enterprise value of our apps portfolio. With regard to free cash flow, we generated $194 million in Q3. The flow-through from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow in Q3 is slightly lower than normal, primarily due to a temporary delay in certain cash collections which we expect will reverse itself in Q4. As previously mentioned in our calls, adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow flow-through is typically 50% to 60% on a normalized run rate basis, noting that we typically have some deviations in any particular quarter driven by the timing of tax payments and working capital movements. This flow-through percentage should increase over time as our high cash flow converting software platform business continues to grow faster than the apps. With regard to guidance for Q4 2023, we are targeting another quarter of growth with revenue between $910 million and $930 million, adjusted EBITDA between $420 million and $440 million and margin between 46% and 47%. Margin outlook is slightly down from Q3\u2019s 48.5% given an approximately 100 basis point benefit from onetime items in Q3 and the potential for further investments in the business in Q4. From a cash perspective, we ended Q3 with $332 million of cash in the balance sheet. In the quarter, we used $582 million of cash to buy back stock and $249 million to pay down our term loan. This was offset by $185 million drawn on the revolver. Regarding stock buybacks. Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased $1.2 billion of our Class A common stock at a weighted average price of under $25 per share. This is consistent with our asset allocation plan and focus on driving long-term shareholder value. On the debt side, in Q3, we amended a portion of our term loans, extending the maturity to 2030, reducing principal amount by $250 million -- $249 million and improving our credit spread. With regard to our Board, we\u2019re pleased to add Todd Morgenfeld in the quarter, a seasoned executive who most recently was a CFO at Pinterest and prior to that, was VP Finance at Twitter. Concurrently, Asha Sharma, COO of Instacart, stepped down from the Board. Overall, our strong Q3 performance showcases the strength and powerful business model underlying our software platform business. Lastly, on a personal note, as Adam mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve decided to transition from a full-time role to an advisory one at the end of this year so I can take some time off and investigate new opportunities. In my new role as adviser to the CEO, I very much look forward to working with Adam and the team on key strategic and financial matters. Further, I will be continuing my service on the AppLovin Board. It has been my privilege to serve as AppLovin President and CFO for the past 4 years, in particular, getting to help build and work with this truly extraordinary management team. Come January, I\u2019m excited to have Matt and Dimitri step into their new and well-deserved leadership roles. Based on their track record and past contributions, I am confident in their success. Since joining the Board in 2018, under Adam\u2019s leadership, the company has achieved tremendous growth, increasing revenues by over 6x and adjusted EBITDA as multiplied from a couple of hundred million dollars of run rate to over $1.6 billion run rate today. While the path has not always been linear, nor easy, the team has remained steadfast and executed with expertise to drive this outstanding performance. Thank you to all the AppLovin stakeholders, including our team, customers, partners, shareholders, lenders and Board who have supported us along our journey thus far. I do say thus far because the opportunity ahead of AppLovin is awesome and I very much look forward to being a part of it in my new role. Now the moderator will take us through Q&A. Yes, we see both sides of the business growing. As we mentioned, we\u2019ve had the first quarter of growth, quarter-over-quarter growth in the app since we started our portfolio optimization program. But clearly, the vast majority of growth will remain in the software side as well as translation if we were able to grow that business translation to EBITDA. EBITDA as we mentioned, there\u2019s some onetime items in the third quarter that will come out in the fourth quarter. And then the fourth quarter, we are considering some additional investments on the growth side, both on the software and app side. Yes. We\u2019re obviously a big customer of our own systems. And we -- when we saw AXON 2 in it\u2019s performance, like a lot of our customers we invested more in UA, and we expect to continue to do that rolling into the fourth quarter. So that was a big driver of growth. Yes, some of the question was breaking up. But I think you\u2019re asking about the gross margin on software and just the improvement year-over-year. Is that correct? Our business model on the software side, first of all, as you know, we report on a net revenue basis, so we start at that level in the P&L. And then in terms of the cost structure itself, that\u2019s directly related to software. A lot of it is the data center infrastructure that we talked about almost a year ago that we had a big new contract that we needed to get to initial amount of initial scale. And so we had to grow into that. I\u2019d say now we\u2019re very much on pace if not growing through some of that contract and so fully utilizing the capacity that we\u2019ve had on board. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to really expand gross margin all the way through to EBITDA given a relatively fixed cost structure on the R&D front. Yes. Good question, Matt. And again, there\u2019s -- every quarter, there\u2019s going to be some bigger reason as to if there\u2019s some fixed cost, incremental cost, step function costs, in particular, on the data center side. But we expect, as I said, R&D to be relatively stable and that software margin can grow and expand as we continue to grow app discovery in particular because that is a net revenue business. Over time, looking at more of the longer run as we scale Worlds, we scale CTV -- sorry, is rescaled the OEM side on Array, we\u2019ll likely need to make some fixed investments in those businesses and hire some teams, but those are also strong margin businesses as they scale up as well, but unlikely to start as high as the contribution that we do get from app discovery."

Then we will open up for Q&A.\nAdam Foroughi: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a stellar second quarter, surpassing our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, largely due to the expansion of our Software Platform business. I am incredibly proud of our dedicated teams who have worked tirelessly to upgrade our advertising algorithms from AXON 1 to AXON 2. We started talking to you a year ago about the benefits we achieve both short- and long-term by upgrading our technology and now we have executed on it. The launch has not only paved the way for a strong quarter, but also provides us with additional opportunities for future growth. The introduction of such a significant change in our technology required many hours of hard work, innovation and risks taken. The result is a true testament to our spirit and commitment and demonstrates that we operate with the same speed and efficiency as we did in our time as a private company. This is what makes me particularly proud of what we have achieved. with cutting edge AI technologies at the heart of our core offering. Our focus will now shift towards continuous enhancement of our technology, expanding our advertiser base and extending AXON 2 to our Wurl and Array businesses. We are optimistic that these measures will fuel growth for years to come. In conclusion, we remain committed to providing long-term shareholder value. We are confident in the potential of our team, our technology and our products, and our financial strength. We appreciate your trust and support and we look forward to our journey of growth and innovation with you. Thank you. On to Herald to provide you with our financial highlights.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. Based on the incredible efforts from our team this year, in particular, leading the launch of our AXON 2.0 engine, we had a strong quarter financially across the Board, with record Software Platform revenue, high margins, impressive operating leverage, and ultimately, robust free cash flow. Our strong performance in the quarter illustrates that the highly focused plan we articulated about a year ago is working. As a reminder, we said we invested in our core team, improve our AI-based platforms and technology, optimize our apps business, drive free cash flow and simplify. Simplify, focus and execute against what we do best. That strategy and plan, which is very similar to the fundamentals on which this company was founded are working and we are excited about where that can take us.  Touching on our financial highlights for the quarter. Our total revenue reached $750 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $334 million, both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBIT margin -- EBITDA margin was 44% and was the highest EBITDA margin we have had in five years. Further, for the quarter, we are pleased to have generated $80 million of positive net income. Our Software Platform segment reached a record revenue of $406 million, which represents two quarters with consecutive mid-teens growth and an increase of 28% over the prior year. Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 39% year-over-year and 25% quarter-over-quarter to $273 million, translating to a 67% adjusted EBITDA margin. Software Platform adjusted EBITDA now represents more than 80% of our company\u2019s total adjusted EBITDA. Of note, during the quarter, we were able to increase adjusted EBITDA by an amount slightly higher than the increase in revenue, equating to over 100% flow-through. While our flow-through will fluctuate in the future, it does highlight the impressive operating leverage from our Software Platform segment. As our Software Platform revenue continues to grow, we expect high flow-through and further margin improvements for this segment. Looking at this segment over the past two years, revenue increased by 2.8 times, representing a 67% compounded annual growth rate. Over that same period, our Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 3 times, a 70% CAGR. We continue to remain optimistic about our opportunities within the Software Platform segment as we continue to improve our AI-based technologies, as well as invest in our growth initiatives, including Connected TV and carrying OEM.  Turning to the App segment. During the quarter, we continued to focus on balancing profitability with revenue. For Q2, we had $334 million of Apps revenue and $61 million of adjusted EBITDA, a margin of 18%. We continue to invest carefully to drive topline growth, both through new game development and user acquisition marketing, while also managing for overall margin, target a mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin range over the medium-term. At the consolidated level, we are pleased to report we had free cash flow of $221 million in Q2, a 66% flow-through of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow. For the first half of 2023, we generated over $0.5 billion in free cash flow. With regard to guidance for Q3 2023, we are targeting another quarter of growth, with revenue between $780 million and $800 million, adjusted EBITDA between $340 million and $360 million and adjusted EBITDA margin between 44% and 45%. We anticipate the first full quarter of revenue contribution from AXON 2.0 to continue driving our growth, as well as see steadier Apps performance.  As previously mentioned on our calls, we continue to target free cash flow of approximately 50% to 60% of adjusted EBITDA on a normalized run rate basis, noting that we may have deviations from that in a particular quarter. From a cash perspective, we ended Q2 with $876 million of cash on the balance sheet. In terms of stock buybacks, we repurchased $507 million of our Class A common stock during the quarter and year-to-date through August 8, we have repurchased $601 million. We have $107 million of authorization remaining under our repurchase program and we will be carefully watching the markets.  We are also watching the leveraged loan markets in real-time to see if we can extend, reduce and/or lower the cost of our term loans. If we see an attractive window, we will move quickly to optimize our capital structure. In conclusion, Q2 was an incredibly strong financially and exemplifies the strength of our business model. Looking forward, our teams continue to be focused on execution and improving our core solutions and technologies. As Adam said, we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us. And now the moderator will take us through Q&A.\nOperator: Great. Thank you so much, Herald. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Matthew Cost. Matthew, looks like Matthew is on audio-only everyone. Just second. Matthew, go ahead. Okay, Matthew, I see you unmuted.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. sorry. Can you hear me?\nOperator: Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. We should and please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. Hi. It\u2019s Dave [ph] on for Matt Cost. And so, sorry if I missed this earlier, there were a few technical difficulties with the audio here for those of us dialing in. But with the strength of the ad network results, I think, that speaks pretty positively to the company\u2019s execution in the quarter. Are you able to give some color on perhaps what portion of the quarter\u2019s performance you would find attributable to your own execution versus an overall recovery in the market? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, Dave, for the question. Market has been steady as we have been talking about for a couple of quarters now. So we attribute the growth in our platform really 100% from the advancements in our core technology. The upgrade made our platform a lot more accurate for advertisers and allows us to really monetize more of a breadth of advertisers. So being able to do both things enabled us to really grow our business on the back half of the quarter as we rolled out this technology. And more importantly, we are driving better value to the advertisers. So we expect this not only to contribute to the growth that we have in the short-term but also the long-term and that\u2019s what gets us really excited.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And maybe just one follow-up, if I could. If we assume that the gaming continues along the trajectory, the guide implies 45% to 50% Software revenue growth year-over-year. How do you view the sustainability of the gains and should we anticipate a similar step function that we saw in AXON 1.0?\nHerald Chen: Yeah. We do view the App side of the business reaching some stability as we have discussed over the past few quarters that the second half of this year. We do see that and we are investing in some new games. We are investing more on user acquisition. In particular, given the fact that we are using a lot of our own solutions there, which has become more efficacious. So we do see our ability to drive some growth over the second half of the year. In terms of the Software side, AXON 2.0 is relatively new. It was launched this last quarter, a full run rate this quarter and we do see an improvement in growth and that is built into our guide for the third quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Great. And we will now hear from Ralph Schackart with William Blair.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Hey, Adam. Hey, Herald. Just looking at the really strong margins that you delivered this quarter, I think, around 44% and guiding for 44% to 45%, I think, next quarter. Historically, the model has contemplated sort of mid-30%s, maybe low 40% or 40% model. Is this a new baseline for margins that we should think about, especially given expectation for further Software margin improvement and growth going forward? And then I have a follow-up.\nHerald Chen: Yeah. Thanks, Ralph, for the question. On the Software side, a 67% margin was a great quarter. As we mentioned in the introduction, we also had very high flow-through. We actually generated more EBITDA than we did relative to the incremental revenue. That doesn\u2019t necessarily continue going forward, but it\u2019s a very high flow-through model there. So we do believe that the margin will continue to expand on Software as we are able to grow the topline over the medium- and long-term, maybe not quarter-to-quarter, given vagaries due to timing. And on the App side, we have always said that we target more in the mid-teens range for EBITDA margin, whereas this past quarter, we are in the high-teens at 18%. As we invest a bit more on the UA side to grow the games that will probably bring down that margin down into the mid-teens. So on a blended basis, as Software grows margin expands, on the App side, reaching stability with potentially slightly lower margins. That\u2019s how we end up at the mid-40%s margin target.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Maybe a question for Adam. Adam, can you maybe get some perspective, AXON 2, how it\u2019s performing maybe relative to your expectations and any sense of order of magnitude of improvements compared to 1, obviously, very strong results in the quarter, but any more color there would be great? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. For sure. We -- I\u2019d say it\u2019s performing at our expectations. We signaled it a year ago as something that was going to be a big upgrade, because we just knew that the technology is available to us were dramatically better than the technologies that we were using. We put it into power the entire platform in the quarter and it was immediate to start seeing much better performance for advertisers. What that does over time, is that all compound and advertisers will be willing to spend more on our platform, because they are seeing better return on ad spend on their buys on our platform than they were previously and that should start to grow over time, get more investment from the base of advertisers we have. But even more exciting for us is, the implications that we are going to be able to make a wider breadth of advertisers work with this new technology. It\u2019s much more predictive, much more powerful, and if we are able to execute on that, we can really broaden out the advertiser base, service new verticals and that should really fuel our growth for quarters and years to come.\nRalph Schackart: Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Herald.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Franco Granda with D.A. Davidson.\nFranco Granda: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. I have two quick ones. So with the market stabilizing here, AXON 2.0 yielding such positive results so early on, are you ready to provide an updated figure on how many dollars you think it transact to your platform either this year or maybe next? And then for the second one, can you talk about maybe any trends across your Apps portfolio that surprised you in the quarter, perhaps, any category where you outperformed the respective market? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. In terms of the scale of the platform, we have never provided that, but the advertising business is on a net revenue basis and we have talked about typical advertising business margins that are known in the industry somewhere in the 20%s to 30% range. And so you could get to a reasonable guesstimate, the marketplace itself is in the billions of dollars, obviously, our Software Platform cleared $400 million and the vast majority of that being advertising networks net revenue in the quarter. So we are a very large player in the mobile app ecosystem. And if you just size that against the totality of the mobile app ecosystem understanding a lot of our partners are mobile gaming customers, we are a critical player for almost all of our customers. They really depend on us for growth. So the thing that really gets us excited in our ecosystem is this upgrade in technology not only helps fuel our growth, our customers are spending a better dollar on our platform and we are usually one of their top one or two or three channels that they invest into. So if they are spending a better dollar on our platform, that will compound for them, too. And so as we go forward, we will start seeing the market of customers that are working with us growing, hopefully materially better than the market itself and return -- helping to return this category as a whole back to grow.\nHerald Chen: And Franco, on your second question, as you tell our Software Platform is performing well because we are delivering great solutions and delivering advertising that\u2019s effective for those customers and so we are doing the same thing for our Apps portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t say we have any outperformance in the Apps portfolio for the second quarter, but we do believe in the second half of this year as we invest more in user acquisition and more on our own platforms, that we should be able to drive additional growth for those Apps.\nFranco Granda: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And moving on to Martin Yang with OpCo.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thanks for taking question. If AXON has performed in line with your expectation, can you give us a sense of where the outperformance came from in the second quarter results relative to your guidance?\nAdam Foroughi: Relative to our guidance, we rolled out the technology towards the second part of the quarter, right? So this is a brand new technology. We thought it was going to be really powerful. It is very, very hard to measure the impact of a new technology to replace -- entirely replace an old one, right? So we were very pleased with the short-term impact. We are more excited about the long-term implications on our overall business. And again, this is a -- it\u2019s an infancy stage. It\u2019s only a couple of months old of the technology. We think it\u2019s going to get a lot stronger over time and we think it\u2019s going to be able to fuel our growth for quarters and years, but we are going to be excited to see what that looks like as we go forward.\nMartin Yang: And my follow-up question on AXON 2 is, throughout, should we expect a continuous improvement throughout the third quarter and when you say Axon 2 is being fully rolled out, does that mean the performance improvement will may come from better algorithm instead of being implemented across more ad inventories?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. As we go forward, the technology will continue to fuel growth from a couple of different vectors. One is, at the level of scale that we operate at, we drive billions of transactions a year. We are able to -- the technology itself will learn and self-improve. Our team, obviously, is working on improving the technology every step of the way. So that also happens in parallel, obviously, core of our engineering focus is on this part of our stock. And then you have got the more interesting long-term dynamic that, if this technology is so good that we are one of the largest channels, if not the largest, for all of our gaming partners and it\u2019s now working within gaming and outside of gaming. It opens up the door to the possibility of a lot of advertiser expansion, which will create more density in our auction, create more scale to the business. And then to your last point, more inventory will come online as well. We are in a -- we operate and really with MAX being a core driver, but more broadly in the mobile app ecosystem in a real-time environment. If our systems are better than they were, in theory, we will get more inventory and our systems will be able to predict more accurate transactions and we are really excited about how all of this will compound over time and create a much bigger opportunity to market for our core business.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nOperator: We have Bernie McTernan with Needham has the next question.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. On the App discovery announcement that came out on Monday in terms of new products, how should we think about which of those should be most impactful? And then can you just remind us on the sales process or the process of signing up other advertisers outside of mobile games. It\u2019s probably pretty clear that as you guys are more successful in increasing return on ad spend for mobile games, they are just going to spend more with you guys, but for a new advertiser to come in, what\u2019s that process of getting them on the platform?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So on the first question, the release really broke down the whole offering into some of the valuable sub-vectors of what we rolled out. But the core product offering is to fully automate the marketing problem and power it with these new AI technologies that we rolled out. In totality, all of the components that we broke down in that article sum up to the value of the whole and so there\u2019s not one part of it that\u2019s more exciting or not, all of it is exciting to us.  On the second question, sales cycle for new, in particular, non-gaming is slower than ramping gaming customers that are already used to our platform and have been buying on our platform. They have been live for years and they see an improvement in the return on ad spend that they are able to achieve on our platform, they will invest more. That is actually mostly automated as it is today. A new customer usually takes a quarter or two to ramp up and we are now seeing a lot more interest in joining the platform, because already only a couple of months into this platform rolling out, there\u2019s a lot of word of mouth spreading amongst App developers, both within gaming and non that our platform is working really well for their peers.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball. Vasily, do you want to go ahead and turn a video for us. Vasily, would you go -- like to go ahead and unmute and ask your question. All right. Well, we are not getting any response from Vasily, so we can go ahead and move on to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Here we go. Hey. Thanks. Adam, I just wanted to see if you could update on whether you see any expected privacy changes either on the iOS or Android side in the next, I don\u2019t know, call it, six months to 12 months that might impact your execution at all or from this point on, do you kind of expect just more incremental changes?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I think we have constantly mentioned this, that what we think, of course, privacy both on the operating system level and amongst regulators will continue to evolve. It\u2019s been something that\u2019s been evolving as we have operated this business for the last five years to seven years. We don\u2019t see anything in the six-month to 12-month term that you referenced that\u2019s going to be a material change to how we would be able to operate our business. And one thing that really has defined our company since we launched, we moved really fast, our core engineering team is really strong, the culture of the company is to operate as a startup at all times and so when it comes to these changes, we have always been able to adapt and operate within the boundaries of the guidelines and that gives us a lot of confidence. No matter what we are facing in the future, we are going to be able to move faster than peers and we are going to be able to continuously improve what we are offering to the advertiser base we work with.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Luke Mott with Wolfe Research.\nLuke Mott: Hi. This is Luke Mott on for Josh with Wolfe Research.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you.\nLuke Mott: Great. Thanks. Just a quick one here. Any update to the competitive dynamics in mediation with the launch of AXON 2.0? Are you seeing any update there or progress or differences?\nAdam Foroughi: Really in mediation a couple of things are happening. We referenced this in a prior call, we believe the majority of the mobile gaming market is on our MAX mediation product. We have seen nothing changed there. The company is utilizing our tool set, both on the mediation side and on our App discovery side we are seeing better growth than peers in the market, because our products work so well and both sides really come together for the publishers that are utilizing our mediation. So not that we have seen a lot of change, because we are already so much of the market but continued strength amongst our publisher base. The other changes coming in mediation is Google Bidding. Google as a partner is a close partner of ours. We were a launch partner for their Google Bidding product. Over the next few months, we expect that they will shift entirely to in-app bidding and away from more traditional methods. That will be a benefit to our MAX product and should be a benefit for publishers and the trueness of that auction. And so we are excited as that scales up, that will be a big positive for our business. Hopefully, theirs and all of our partners.\nLuke Mott: Great. Thanks. And I just had one quick follow-up here. In regards to Wurl, just any update there and if you plan to continue maybe focusing on some of these areas outside of the core continuing to invest in a further iteration of AXON? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Totally, in my talk track, I referenced expanding the technology that we just built Axon 2 over the Wurl and Array. And on the Wurl side, when we did the Wurl transaction, we were really excited about the competency of their team and really the relationships that they had with the media companies to be able to get to the Connected TV landscape and go get inventory, and be able to mediate and serve into that inventory, not dissimilar to how we were able to scale on mobile and the Wurl team has been executing really strongly there.  Now as we extend AXON 2 over to CTV, we think it\u2019s a really strong extension point for the advertisers that buy on our platform. And to be able to sell performance media on television is something that people have talked about for years, but very few companies have been able to deliver any sort of solution there. And we do know that our AXON 2 offering is cutting-edge and as potent as there is in performance marketing as far as the technology goes. So extending it to Connected TV could pose a very big growth channel for our business and that of our partners.\nLuke Mott: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one additional question from Omar Dessouky with BofA. I do believe he is audio-only. Omar, if you can hear me, please go ahead with your question. And Omar, again, if you are -- we see that you are unmuted to hear on the phone, please make sure that\u2019s unmuted as well. We can\u2019t hear you currently. All right, Omar, I am giving you one more chance. If you can hear me, you are still muted. Go ahead and ask your question. All right. With no response from Omar, that does conclude our question-and-answer for this quarter. Adam and Harold, thank you so much and to everyone who joined us today. We thank you all for joining us today. Have a great afternoon.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, everyone.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a stellar second quarter, surpassing our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, largely due to the expansion of our Software Platform business. I am incredibly proud of our dedicated teams who have worked tirelessly to upgrade our advertising algorithms from AXON 1 to AXON 2. We started talking to you a year ago about the benefits we achieve both short- and long-term by upgrading our technology and now we have executed on it. The launch has not only paved the way for a strong quarter, but also provides us with additional opportunities for future growth. The introduction of such a significant change in our technology required many hours of hard work, innovation and risks taken. The result is a true testament to our spirit and commitment and demonstrates that we operate with the same speed and efficiency as we did in our time as a private company. This is what makes me particularly proud of what we have achieved. with cutting edge AI technologies at the heart of our core offering. Our focus will now shift towards continuous enhancement of our technology, expanding our advertiser base and extending AXON 2 to our Wurl and Array businesses. We are optimistic that these measures will fuel growth for years to come. In conclusion, we remain committed to providing long-term shareholder value. We are confident in the potential of our team, our technology and our products, and our financial strength. We appreciate your trust and support and we look forward to our journey of growth and innovation with you. Thank you. On to Herald to provide you with our financial highlights.

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. Based on the incredible efforts from our team this year, in particular, leading the launch of our AXON 2.0 engine, we had a strong quarter financially across the Board, with record Software Platform revenue, high margins, impressive operating leverage, and ultimately, robust free cash flow. Our strong performance in the quarter illustrates that the highly focused plan we articulated about a year ago is working. As a reminder, we said we invested in our core team, improve our AI-based platforms and technology, optimize our apps business, drive free cash flow and simplify. Simplify, focus and execute against what we do best. That strategy and plan, which is very similar to the fundamentals on which this company was founded are working and we are excited about where that can take us.  Touching on our financial highlights for the quarter. Our total revenue reached $750 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $334 million, both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBIT margin -- EBITDA margin was 44% and was the highest EBITDA margin we have had in five years. Further, for the quarter, we are pleased to have generated $80 million of positive net income. Our Software Platform segment reached a record revenue of $406 million, which represents two quarters with consecutive mid-teens growth and an increase of 28% over the prior year. Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 39% year-over-year and 25% quarter-over-quarter to $273 million, translating to a 67% adjusted EBITDA margin. Software Platform adjusted EBITDA now represents more than 80% of our company\u2019s total adjusted EBITDA. Of note, during the quarter, we were able to increase adjusted EBITDA by an amount slightly higher than the increase in revenue, equating to over 100% flow-through. While our flow-through will fluctuate in the future, it does highlight the impressive operating leverage from our Software Platform segment. As our Software Platform revenue continues to grow, we expect high flow-through and further margin improvements for this segment. Looking at this segment over the past two years, revenue increased by 2.8 times, representing a 67% compounded annual growth rate. Over that same period, our Software Platform adjusted EBITDA grew 3 times, a 70% CAGR. We continue to remain optimistic about our opportunities within the Software Platform segment as we continue to improve our AI-based technologies, as well as invest in our growth initiatives, including Connected TV and carrying OEM.  Turning to the App segment. During the quarter, we continued to focus on balancing profitability with revenue. For Q2, we had $334 million of Apps revenue and $61 million of adjusted EBITDA, a margin of 18%. We continue to invest carefully to drive topline growth, both through new game development and user acquisition marketing, while also managing for overall margin, target a mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin range over the medium-term. At the consolidated level, we are pleased to report we had free cash flow of $221 million in Q2, a 66% flow-through of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow. For the first half of 2023, we generated over $0.5 billion in free cash flow. With regard to guidance for Q3 2023, we are targeting another quarter of growth, with revenue between $780 million and $800 million, adjusted EBITDA between $340 million and $360 million and adjusted EBITDA margin between 44% and 45%. We anticipate the first full quarter of revenue contribution from AXON 2.0 to continue driving our growth, as well as see steadier Apps performance.  As previously mentioned on our calls, we continue to target free cash flow of approximately 50% to 60% of adjusted EBITDA on a normalized run rate basis, noting that we may have deviations from that in a particular quarter. From a cash perspective, we ended Q2 with $876 million of cash on the balance sheet. In terms of stock buybacks, we repurchased $507 million of our Class A common stock during the quarter and year-to-date through August 8, we have repurchased $601 million. We have $107 million of authorization remaining under our repurchase program and we will be carefully watching the markets.  We are also watching the leveraged loan markets in real-time to see if we can extend, reduce and/or lower the cost of our term loans. If we see an attractive window, we will move quickly to optimize our capital structure. In conclusion, Q2 was an incredibly strong financially and exemplifies the strength of our business model. Looking forward, our teams continue to be focused on execution and improving our core solutions and technologies. As Adam said, we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us. And now the moderator will take us through Q&A. Yeah. We do view the App side of the business reaching some stability as we have discussed over the past few quarters that the second half of this year. We do see that and we are investing in some new games. We are investing more on user acquisition. In particular, given the fact that we are using a lot of our own solutions there, which has become more efficacious. So we do see our ability to drive some growth over the second half of the year. In terms of the Software side, AXON 2.0 is relatively new. It was launched this last quarter, a full run rate this quarter and we do see an improvement in growth and that is built into our guide for the third quarter. Yeah. Thanks, Ralph, for the question. On the Software side, a 67% margin was a great quarter. As we mentioned in the introduction, we also had very high flow-through. We actually generated more EBITDA than we did relative to the incremental revenue. That doesn\u2019t necessarily continue going forward, but it\u2019s a very high flow-through model there. So we do believe that the margin will continue to expand on Software as we are able to grow the topline over the medium- and long-term, maybe not quarter-to-quarter, given vagaries due to timing. And on the App side, we have always said that we target more in the mid-teens range for EBITDA margin, whereas this past quarter, we are in the high-teens at 18%. As we invest a bit more on the UA side to grow the games that will probably bring down that margin down into the mid-teens. So on a blended basis, as Software grows margin expands, on the App side, reaching stability with potentially slightly lower margins. That\u2019s how we end up at the mid-40%s margin target. And Franco, on your second question, as you tell our Software Platform is performing well because we are delivering great solutions and delivering advertising that\u2019s effective for those customers and so we are doing the same thing for our Apps portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t say we have any outperformance in the Apps portfolio for the second quarter, but we do believe in the second half of this year as we invest more in user acquisition and more on our own platforms, that we should be able to drive additional growth for those Apps."

This conference call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our IR website. I'll turn it over to Adam for some opening remarks, then we'll open it up for Q&A.\nAdam Foroughi: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong Q1 on our software platform business with significant growth quarter-over-quarter. This was directly attributable to our advertisers seeing improved performance on our platform and returning to more of a growth mindset, leading them to more confidently spend with us. Further, we've always talked about mobile gaming being a resilient category and we always believed it would be stable even in weaker economic times. We're seeing just that. At AppLovin, our teams have been working tirelessly over the past few quarters, focusing on several key growth initiatives. Firstly, we have been working on significant upgrades to our advertising technology. This has been a major focus for us and we are starting to see early benefits from these efforts. Secondly, we have been working hard to unlock the synergies from our Wurl acquisition by bringing our advertising platform into CTV. While we don't expect this to have a material financial impact in the near term, we are excited about the early data we are seeing in this area. And finally, we're extending our marketing solutions to carriers and OEMs through our Array business. Although this is still in the early stages, we are pleased with our progress. At the same time, we have been optimizing our gaming business and are now running at a more efficient level. We are confident that this business will be a stable source of cash flow going forward. Now let's talk a little bit more in detail about AXON improvements. We have been discussing the development of AXON 2 for a year now and have always communicated that our strongest growth would come from advancements in our own technology. It's been challenging to explain what this means, but with the exploding popularity of consumer-facing AI tools, we can draw a simple analogy. Upgrading from AXON 1 to 2 is no different than OpenAI moving from ChatGPT 3 to 4. Our models can always be improved, and our entire business is powered by the evolution of our technology. The enhancements to our machine learning and AI are not a onetime thing, but a series of upgrades over time. As we make these, there is the potential for significant lifts to both revenue and cash flow. We are currently in the midst of a staged rollout of AXON 2 and we are very excited about the long-term potential of this new technology for our partners and our business. We are extremely pleased with our execution so far this year. We believe that our technology and innovation will continue to be the driving force behind our success and we are committed to continuously improving our business. Thank you again for joining us today and we look forward to sharing more updates with you in the future. With that, I'll hand it off to Herald.\nHerald Chen: Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin by expressing my gratitude to Ryan Gee for his leadership of our IR activities over the past few years. Additionally, I want to extend a warm welcome to David Hsiao, who joined AppLovin in early '21 and has taken on the Head of IR role for the company. As Adam mentioned, we had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations across revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Importantly, in addition to financial performance, we're just as pleased with the focused execution and progress achieved by our teams during the quarter, in particular, as it pertains to our software platform growth initiatives. To touch on a few key financial highlights, in Q1, our revenue reached $715 million and our adjusted EBITDA hit $274 million surpassing the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, which was the highest run rate margin we've had since 2018. Our software platform segment was a standout performer recording -- record quarterly revenue of $355 million, which is a 16% increase over the prior quarter. What's more, our software platform adjusted EBITDA grew 18% quarter-over-quarter to $219 million translating to a 62% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our software platform growth over the past two years has been robust with Q1 '23 revenue exceeding Q1 '21 revenue by over 4 times. This represents a 100% compounded annual growth rate. Additionally, software platform adjusted EBITDA increased from $59 million in Q1 '21 to $219 million in Q1 '23, a strong 90% plus CAGR. As Adam noted, while it's challenging to predict the precise timing and impact of our software platform growth initiatives, we are optimistic that they will drive meaningful revenue growth and high-margin cash flow. Turning to the App segment. We had $361 million of revenue in Q1, a 9% decline from prior quarter, which includes the impact of optimizing certain studio assets. Q1 App's adjusted EBITDA was $55 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 15%. The margin was slightly lower than recent quarters due to the launch of several new games leading to an increase in user acquisition spend as a percentage of revenue. As a consolidated level, we are pleased to report that we have robust free cash flow of $283 million in Q1, due in part to the growth of our high margin software platform business. We also benefited from several significant customer payments delayed from prior periods as well as lower cash taxes in the period. With regard to guidance for Q2 '23, we are targeting $710 million to $730 million in revenue with $280 million to $300 million in adjusted EBITDA, which equates to a 39% to 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. We anticipate continuing growth from our software platform business, offset to some degree by the apps business. The impact of the AXON 2.0 rollout will be a key factor in the quarter. As previously mentioned on our calls, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 50% to 60% of adjusted EBITDA on a normal run rate basis, noting that we may have some deviations from that in any particular quarter. From a cash perspective, at the end of Q1, we had $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a clear testament to our strong financial position and cash generation. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $76 million of stock. And year-to-date through May 8, we repurchased $202 million of stock, leaving $210 million on our $750 million authorized buyback program. As we look toward the future, we're determined to maintain our position as a market leader by investing in our teams, solutions and key growth initiatives. Our strong financial position and cash generation allows us to take calculated risks to make strategic decisions to keep AppLovin at the forefront of the industry. It's an exciting time for AppLovin, and we're excited about our future prospects. Now I invite the moderator to lead us through Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you so much. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Good afternoon, Adam, Herald. My first question is on the strength for software platform and how much did AXON 2 -- will always AXON to a meaningful driver for that performance sequentially?\nAdam Foroughi: Hey, Martin. Thanks for the question. And really AXON 2, we talked about -- we're now in the midst of a stage rollout so that came after the quarter. In Q1, we did see improvements in our core technology, the AXON 1.0 version. And incremental improvements in our technology is fundamentally core to our business on an ongoing basis. We also saw more confidence from advertisers spending on our platform as they were seeing good results. And the mindset in the ecosystem is starting to return back to growth. We're seeing good industry momentum as well.\nMartin Yang: Got it. So would you say the sequential improvement was more in line with market as opposed to you're taking share from someone else?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I would talk about it not in with market because I don't think the market grew 20% quarter-over-quarter. Much more so efficiency gains in technology, our advertisers investing more with their selves. And we don't really think about this market as zero sum. So it's not a, we take an extra $0.20 and someone else loses $0.20. We think about it as additive to the market. So our improved efficiency creates gains in the market for all of our partners. And peers, by default, would benefit from that as well.\nMartin Yang: Thank you. My second question is more on Google's including AppLovin as well as some three other players in their open bidding or real-time bidding. Can you maybe comment on the long-term implication of that and how that helped or impact your business? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yes. We're super bullish on this. We've been -- we really brought MAX to the market originally with Facebook both us and them being early stage adopting bidding, believing that it's a much more efficient way to go. And Google now leaning in for the first time in their history to external solutions is a huge win for the ecosystem. We think them bringing their demand more efficiently to the market will create upside for the whole market. So we've been a partner of theirs in this movement for a while. It's now open to all publishers in the ecosystem. MAX, obviously, is the majority share of mediation in gaming. And so we can extend their demand in a very efficient manner to the bulk of mobile gaming publishers and we're excited about that. More broadly speaking, we've got a great relationship with Google and we continue to build on that.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nOperator: Now moving on to Ralph Schackart with William Blair.\nRalph Schackart: Hi. Two questions, if I could, please. Adam, in the letter, you talked about partial stabilization in the mobile ad market. Can you maybe talk about the linearity that you saw throughout the quarter in stabilization. How did you exit the quarter versus how you entered it? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean what we're seeing just generally and this is true in a lot of my conversations with mobile game developers as well, a lot more confidence in the ecosystem. Now that we've gone through last year, the economy seems a little bit more stable. We feel like we're reaching that trough point. And so mobile gaming developers are starting to be more growth mindset oriented, which is great for our business as those dollars come in, it will lead to growth. And that confidence builds over time. So obviously reflected in our guidance, you saw and in Herald's commentary, reference to the software platform continuing to perform really well. This isn't a onetime event or set function. We're very confident where this business is going.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Maybe kind of leading to the software business. You talked about the strong growth and it seems like the market is sort of stabilizing. I know you're not giving full year guidance, but anything that you're seeing currently that would preclude this growth rate sort of persisting through 2023 or just sort of broadly speaking, how should we think about growth this year on the software business? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: We're really looking at it to sort of building blocks. Last year, obviously, it was difficult for the whole ad ecosystem and the economy in general. Now we're -- we've got one good quarter in place. The biggest change for us in our business today is we're rolling out AXON 2. There's a material upgrade of our core platform, and we're really excited about it. The team working on this is phenomenal. And so getting this out to market could become a catalyst for our own growth. But we\u2019ve always talked about our position in this market is quite large in the mobile gaming ecosystem. So if we\u2019re able to become more efficient, we\u2019ll create growth across the whole sector. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about. We think this \u2013 if it continues to go well as we roll this out throughout the rest of the year, we\u2019ll be able to create growth in this ecosystem irregardless of what\u2019s going on around us.\nRalph Schackart: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move on to David Pang with Stifel.\nDavid Pang: Great. Thanks. I was just hoping to see what your expectations are for the ad spend flowing through MAX in '23. And if you could remind us what your near-term and intermediate targets are?\nAdam Foroughi: Those are not numbers we've really disclosed. We do see good momentum on MAX. As the market becomes more efficient and you get more heavy bidders live, that usually creates increases to pub spend on the platform. So that creates gains. Those ARPDAU gains that these publishers get allows them to then go market more. And as systems like ours become more efficient, it gives them a better place to go market themselves. It creates growth. So we're seeing good momentum on that platform, very high stickiness across our publisher base. So the MAX product is in a really good spot. We're just not disclosing the exact numbers on that product.\nDavid Pang: Just as one follow-up. Could you provide a ballpark of what portion of the spend is currently in RTB?\nAdam Foroughi: Now we've talked about real-time bidding as being the majority of the platform already, and Google taking it to the vast majority as that product scales out.\nDavid Pang: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And D.A. Davidson's Franco Granda has the next question.\nFranco Granda: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. I'd like to reference the AXON 1 as the same way as AMD references architectures by saying that they age like fine wine. Are you approaching AXON 2 in a similar way where the efficiency continues to build on top of itself as you continue to iterate on it?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean the world we live in today with these AI technologies is the fastest evolution and change in technology we've ever seen in our lifetimes. The rate of innovation is just incredible. And so as we go to AXON 2, there's, on an ongoing basis, incremental improvements that we can make to the platform. That will fuel our business for some time. And then there's the incremental uptick to AXON 3 and then AXON 4 and AXON 5. This core expertise is going to drive our business for a very, very long time. These technologies are only going to get more powerful. And because of our market-leading position, we've got so much volume flowing through our systems that efficiency gains from these technologies, as they evolve, will generate lifts to revenue. And we've always talked about how our software business technology drive lifts to revenue and a very high flow through and that's what we're excited about.\nFranco Granda: Awesome. Thanks for that color. And then going to the apps business, it seems like the in-app purchases been well in the quarter on a relative basis, and then the advertising was where it kind of fell off or dipped a little bit. Any trends to note there? Was it just ad spend softness?\nA \u2013 Herald Chen: I think in general, there was some ad trend softness and some seasonality coming off the fourth quarter. Also, we -- about half the delta on the revenue from quarter-over-quarter on the app side actually came from us closing down some studios or divesting studios as well. So there\u2019s some, I guess, call it, onetime impacts in terms of the mix there.\nFranco Granda: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: I will now hear from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi. This is Stefanos Crist calling in for Bernie. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you just remind us on point number three of the growth drivers of extending the marketing platform to carriers and OEMs. What gives you the confidence you have the technology and relationships to do that organically?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean, what gives us the confidence there is we're so good on the marketing technologies in our core business. And that industry is quite nascent. There's only a couple of players in there. We all end up having to place a similar game in the mobile gaming category. In that category, we've got the market-leading technologies, and we've proven that for a very, very long time. And so extending that core efficiency out to the carriers and OEM space seem like a very smart thing to do. Incremental to that, we're bringing some new products to the carriers and OEMs, too, that we think will make a material impact to their businesses, and in turn, ours. So we're excited about where that can go. I will caveat it with new businesses that we're going after that are related to our core business aren't going to move the needle on a $1 billion plus software business in the short term. These are businesses that we expect when we're talking to you all in three years, we're talking about big parts of our business, but this is not a short-term bet. This is one that we're investing into and expect to pay off materially in the long term.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you. And then just speaking of the competitive environment, have you seen any changes there with the combination of Unity and ironSource you can touch on? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: We can't really talk to peers and what they're up to. And we just know that bringing 2 big companies together and integration takes time. It's difficult. We also know that in this ecosystem, we need them to do well. They need us to do well. All marketing companies drive the growth of our partners. And so long as every company is operating efficiently, we'll see growth. We did grow a lot in the quarter, and so our products have been very, very sticky, and we expect that to continue.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you.\nOperator: Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs has the next question.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much. Maybe two, if I could. Coming back to the apps business, is there anything you're calling out in terms of new game launches we should be keeping in mind between now and the remainder of 2023, just so we better understand some of the potential mismatches between revenue growth and investing on those game launches and how it might impact on the margin landscape? That would be number one. And then number two, coming back to the broader advertising landscape. It sounded like you talked a little bit about it already, but I wanted to go a little bit deeper into the Connected TV opportunity and how you're thinking about that helping widen out potential further advertiser diversity and density in terms of your platform over the medium to long term? Thanks so much.\nHerald Chen: Yes. Thanks, Eric. I'll take the apps question first. Overall, we're very pleased on getting the other side of our major optimization of that portfolio of apps. We're down about 11 studios, which we're investing against. And we do have a number of new game launches coming, I think, out of every studio. They've got a game plan to launch new games. And this -- this quarter's impact, I think we've always said it would be in the mid-teens margin on a run rate basis. I think we remain there, Eric. If there's a whole bolus of games that we thought were really awesome, that margin could come down. I think it will still be a double-digit number. But right now, we see it really building into the business model of regularly launching games. We think the margin should remain in that mid-teens range.\nAdam Foroughi: On the CTV question, Eric, we're -- we obviously invested in Wurl a little over a year ago. They've got pre-existing relationships with a lot of the media companies. And you think of them as like a CDN for these companies, but they help them bring their content online and schedule the content, build effectively channels on the connected TV devices across all the various devices in that fragmented space. Those preexisting relationships were what we were excited about. They also have an SSP business. And so we're already in market. We're plugging in our AppDiscovery solution through their SSP to connected TV inventory. This is early, early stage. So we talked about no significant impact to our financial performance in the near term. But the data is strong. The offering is really cool for mobile app developers. There hasn't been a scaled performance based solution in this category really ever in that manner on a performance basis and we charge for performance. And so the advertisers that are leaning into it are leaning into it and very excited by the potential of us scaling that offering.\nOperator: And we have time for one additional question, which will come from Matt Cost with Morgan Stanley. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi. This is Dave on for Matt. Apologies if I missed this earlier, but are you able to give a sense of time line on the, I guess, full release of AXON 2? I know earlier, you said that you were rolling it out. And how should we think about the financial impact, if you can share any color there?\nAdam Foroughi: I'll talk about the time line, Herald can cover financial impact. But we're in market rolling it out in stages. It's a complex technological upgrade that we are excited by the early results, and we've reflected confidence in our guidance going forward.\nHerald Chen: Just on impact, I think earlier, we did say that there was no impact because it had not been rolled out at all in the first quarter for AXON 2.0. And then going forward, it is still difficult to predict the timing of the rollout and then ultimately the impact financially of the technology. But what we do know is the technology is superior to AXON 1.0. Just like as Adam said in his script that we see what ChatGPT does from 3 to 4, 4 to 5. So we know it's better technology, it's more effective, it's more efficient. And so we do believe that there will be a significant impact on the software line. When it hits is difficult to predict. The other thing we also know, though, given the software margins, we do think a significant amount of that revenue does flow through to the bottom line. So it will be a very high percentage increase in the margin as well.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session for this quarter. We thank you all so much for joining us today. Enjoy the rest of your day, and we will see you next time.\nHerald Chen: Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Thank you.",

And so as we go to AXON 2, there's, on an ongoing basis, incremental improvements that we can make to the platform. That will fuel our business for some time. And then there's the incremental uptick to AXON 3 and then AXON 4 and AXON 5. This core expertise is going to drive our business for a very, very long time. These technologies are only going to get more powerful. And because of our market-leading position, we've got so much volume flowing through our systems that efficiency gains from these technologies, as they evolve, will generate lifts to revenue. And we've always talked about how our software business technology drive lifts to revenue and a very high flow through and that's what we're excited about. Yeah. I mean, what gives us the confidence there is we're so good on the marketing technologies in our core business. And that industry is quite nascent. There's only a couple of players in there. We all end up having to place a similar game in the mobile gaming category. In that category, we've got the market-leading technologies, and we've proven that for a very, very long time. And so extending that core efficiency out to the carriers and OEM space seem like a very smart thing to do. Incremental to that, we're bringing some new products to the carriers and OEMs, too, that we think will make a material impact to their businesses, and in turn, ours. So we're excited about where that can go. I will caveat it with new businesses that we're going after that are related to our core business aren't going to move the needle on a $1 billion plus software business in the short term. These are businesses that we expect when we're talking to you all in three years, we're talking about big parts of our business, but this is not a short-term bet. This is one that we're investing into and expect to pay off materially in the long term. We can't really talk to peers and what they're up to. And we just know that bringing 2 big companies together and integration takes time. It's difficult. We also know that in this ecosystem, we need them to do well. They need us to do well. All marketing companies drive the growth of our partners. And so long as every company is operating efficiently, we'll see growth. We did grow a lot in the quarter, and so our products have been very, very sticky, and we expect that to continue. On the CTV question, Eric, we're -- we obviously invested in Wurl a little over a year ago. They've got pre-existing relationships with a lot of the media companies. And you think of them as like a CDN for these companies, but they help them bring their content online and schedule the content, build effectively channels on the connected TV devices across all the various devices in that fragmented space. Those preexisting relationships were what we were excited about. They also have an SSP business. And so we're already in market. We're plugging in our AppDiscovery solution through their SSP to connected TV inventory. This is early, early stage. So we talked about no significant impact to our financial performance in the near term. But the data is strong. The offering is really cool for mobile app developers. There hasn't been a scaled performance based solution in this category really ever in that manner on a performance basis and we charge for performance. And so the advertisers that are leaning into it are leaning into it and very excited by the potential of us scaling that offering. I'll talk about the time line, Herald can cover financial impact. But we're in market rolling it out in stages. It's a complex technological upgrade that we are excited by the early results, and we've reflected confidence in our guidance going forward. Thank you."

            "name": "Herald Chen",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin by expressing my gratitude to Ryan Gee for his leadership of our IR activities over the past few years. Additionally, I want to extend a warm welcome to David Hsiao, who joined AppLovin in early '21 and has taken on the Head of IR role for the company. As Adam mentioned, we had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations across revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Importantly, in addition to financial performance, we're just as pleased with the focused execution and progress achieved by our teams during the quarter, in particular, as it pertains to our software platform growth initiatives. To touch on a few key financial highlights, in Q1, our revenue reached $715 million and our adjusted EBITDA hit $274 million surpassing the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, which was the highest run rate margin we've had since 2018. Our software platform segment was a standout performer recording -- record quarterly revenue of $355 million, which is a 16% increase over the prior quarter. What's more, our software platform adjusted EBITDA grew 18% quarter-over-quarter to $219 million translating to a 62% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our software platform growth over the past two years has been robust with Q1 '23 revenue exceeding Q1 '21 revenue by over 4 times. This represents a 100% compounded annual growth rate. Additionally, software platform adjusted EBITDA increased from $59 million in Q1 '21 to $219 million in Q1 '23, a strong 90% plus CAGR. As Adam noted, while it's challenging to predict the precise timing and impact of our software platform growth initiatives, we are optimistic that they will drive meaningful revenue growth and high-margin cash flow. Turning to the App segment. We had $361 million of revenue in Q1, a 9% decline from prior quarter, which includes the impact of optimizing certain studio assets. Q1 App's adjusted EBITDA was $55 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 15%. The margin was slightly lower than recent quarters due to the launch of several new games leading to an increase in user acquisition spend as a percentage of revenue. As a consolidated level, we are pleased to report that we have robust free cash flow of $283 million in Q1, due in part to the growth of our high margin software platform business. We also benefited from several significant customer payments delayed from prior periods as well as lower cash taxes in the period. With regard to guidance for Q2 '23, we are targeting $710 million to $730 million in revenue with $280 million to $300 million in adjusted EBITDA, which equates to a 39% to 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. We anticipate continuing growth from our software platform business, offset to some degree by the apps business. The impact of the AXON 2.0 rollout will be a key factor in the quarter. As previously mentioned on our calls, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 50% to 60% of adjusted EBITDA on a normal run rate basis, noting that we may have some deviations from that in any particular quarter. From a cash perspective, at the end of Q1, we had $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a clear testament to our strong financial position and cash generation. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $76 million of stock. And year-to-date through May 8, we repurchased $202 million of stock, leaving $210 million on our $750 million authorized buyback program. As we look toward the future, we're determined to maintain our position as a market leader by investing in our teams, solutions and key growth initiatives. Our strong financial position and cash generation allows us to take calculated risks to make strategic decisions to keep AppLovin at the forefront of the industry. It's an exciting time for AppLovin, and we're excited about our future prospects. Now I invite the moderator to lead us through Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Eric. I'll take the apps question first. Overall, we're very pleased on getting the other side of our major optimization of that portfolio of apps. We're down about 11 studios, which we're investing against. And we do have a number of new game launches coming, I think, out of every studio. They've got a game plan to launch new games. And this -- this quarter's impact, I think we've always said it would be in the mid-teens margin on a run rate basis. I think we remain there, Eric. If there's a whole bolus of games that we thought were really awesome, that margin could come down. I think it will still be a double-digit number. But right now, we see it really building into the business model of regularly launching games. We think the margin should remain in that mid-teens range. Just on impact, I think earlier, we did say that there was no impact because it had not been rolled out at all in the first quarter for AXON 2.0. And then going forward, it is still difficult to predict the timing of the rollout and then ultimately the impact financially of the technology. But what we do know is the technology is superior to AXON 1.0. Just like as Adam said in his script that we see what ChatGPT does from 3 to 4, 4 to 5. So we know it's better technology, it's more effective, it's more efficient. And so we do believe that there will be a significant impact on the software line. When it hits is difficult to predict. The other thing we also know, though, given the software margins, we do think a significant amount of that revenue does flow through to the bottom line. So it will be a very high percentage increase in the margin as well. Thank you."

        "content": "Adam Foroughi: Thank you all for joining us. We're excited to welcome a growing group of investors this quarter. Before we dive into our strong Q3 results, I want to emphasize the role that our culture plays as a fundamental strength in our business. Recently in Silicon Valley, much has been said about the importance of founder mode. While I'm a very hands-on founder, I believe that the key to our success lies not only in my hands-on approach, but more importantly, in surrounding myself with a team that shares a similar mindset and drive. Here are some defining traits of that mindset. We act like owners, treating the business with personal accountability. We approach each day with urgency and purpose. We have an insatiable desire to learn. We are driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence. We're constantly optimizing for diversity of thought and unity of ambition. We prioritize automation wherever possible. We don't get bogged down in overthinking. Instead, we make decisions and take action, adjusting quickly when needed. Our managers aren't just managers, they're doers, and expected to lead by example. We take pride in our profitability, with our business generating over $1.5 million in run rate adjusted EBITDA per employee, an efficiency we aim to improve. This quarter, I took on oversight of our HR function to ensure our culture thrives as we continue to grow. Now, turning to our quarterly performance. We continue to execute well, expanding our core business and laying the groundwork for sustained growth. Last quarter, I shared our confidence in achieving 20% to 30% year-over-year growth for the foreseeable future. We continue to expect 4% to 5% quarterly growth through self-learning and market growth, with occasional step changes resulting from enhancements to our AXON algorithm. This quarter, we saw one of those step changes, with meaningful growth driven by advancements to AXON. While we can't predict the timing of these breakthroughs, we're in the early stages of AI software development, both within our company and in the broader industry. We expect ongoing research advancements to continue driving our technology forward. While we remain confident in 20% to 30% growth for mobile gaming advertisers alone, we're also exploring new areas, as shown by our recent e-commerce pilot. Early data has exceeded our expectations, with the advertisers in the pilot seeing substantial returns, often surpassing those from other media channels, and in many cases, experiencing nearly a 100% incrementality from our traffic. We're increasingly confident this vertical will scale significantly in 2025 and become a strong contributor for us over the next year and beyond. To support this, we've streamlined resources and are reallocating talent from other initiatives to our e-commerce go-to-market team. In the next few quarters, we'll launch a self-service platform, opening global opportunities for advertisers of all sizes. Next, an update on our earnings communication. While we've been issuing quarterly shareholder letters, we believe businesses are built over years, not quarters. And to align with this vision, we will shift to an annual shareholder letter. Financial results and guidance will still be released quarterly, but each year, we'll provide a comprehensive summary of the past year and our plans for the future in the form of an annual shareholder letter. Finally, I'd like to thank our team for their outstanding execution and relentless drive. After 13 years, I'm continually inspired by the passion and excellence that define our company. We're in the early stages of building one of the world's most innovative technology platforms. The future is incredibly bright, and we have the right team to seize every opportunity in front of us. Now, I'll hand it off to Matt to run you through the financial details.\nMatt Stumpf: Good afternoon. We had another fantastic quarter, with total revenue reaching $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $722 million, achieving a 60% adjusted EBITDA margin. This marks a 39% increase in revenue and a 72% increase in adjusted EBITDA from the same period last year, translating to an impressive 91% flow-through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA. In the third quarter, we generated $545 million in free cash flow. That's up 182% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, our free cash flow grew 22%, consistent with adjusted EBITDA growth over the same period, and representing 76% flow-through from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, we had $568 million in cash and cash equivalents, and 335 million shares outstanding. During the quarter, improvements in our AXON technology, driven by ongoing self-learning and enhancements by our engineering team, contributed to further growth of our Software Platform. This segment generated $835 million in revenue and $653 million in adjusted EBITDA, achieving a 78% margin and growing 66% in revenue and 79% in adjusted EBITDA from the same period last year. Quarter-over-quarter flow-through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA was 107%. Our Software Platform adjusted EBITDA this quarter was positively impacted by several non-recurring cost benefits associated with the renewal of our Google Cloud contract, PSU vesting in the prior quarter, and foreign exchange. On a normalized basis, we estimate our quarter-over-quarter flow-through would be approximately 100%. Next quarter, we expect software flow-through to reduce slightly as a result of PSU-related vesting costs and an increase in data center capacity to support future growth. As our core advertising business now represents substantially all of our Software Platform revenue and future focus for the company, starting with our next shareholder letter and annual 10-K, we will rename our Software Platform and associated revenue to Advertising to better align with the nature of this business. Our Apps revenue for the quarter was $363 million, a 1% increase from last year, with $68 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 19% margin. We continue to expect the Apps business to be stable in the future. We believe a strong capital structure and effective capital allocation plan are crucial to the creation of long-term shareholder value. To that end, we're focused on a few areas. First and foremost, to drive organic growth by recruiting top talent and investing in our technology in the most lean and cost efficient way possible. Second, to manage our outstanding shares through ongoing repurchases funded from free cash flow and prudent equity grants to employees. This quarter, we retired and withheld a total of 5 million shares for a total cost of $437 million. To further our share management efforts, we also received our Board's approval to increase our repurchase authorization by $2 billion, bringing our remaining authorization to a total of $2.3 billion. And third, to build a strong capital foundation, with sufficient liquidity to support financial flexibility with a net debt leverage ratio below 2 times. Finally, turning to our financial guidance for next quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate to deliver between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion in revenue, with adjusted EBITDA between $740 million and $760 million, targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 60%. Now with that, let's move to Q&A.\nOperator: Okay. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of our call. Be sure to unmute your equipment, turn your video on before asking your question. We'll get through as many as we can in the time allotted. Our first question comes from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Clark?\nClark Lampen: Hey, if you could you guys hear me alright?\nOperator: We can hear you. We can't see you well.\nClark Lampen: Okay. Sorry. Having some tech issues tonight, which is something that you guys based on these quarter's results, you're completely unfamiliar with. I just wanted to -- if I could, I wanted to unpack 3Q performance a little bit. Adam, at the risk of asking kind of an obvious and dumb question, I would assume that while commerce is in pilot phase, there's really very little revenue contribution. Is that right? And then, if so, for the existing gaming and non-gaming businesses, was one a bigger contributor this quarter? Meaning was one more responsive, I guess, to the performance improvements that you delivered? And then, Matt, I'll just ask amidst my tech difficulties the second question and then get out of the way here. The capacity increase that you took down this quarter, is it possible to contextualize for us how big the cluster expansion was? And was this earlier than you expected also? Thanks a lot.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So, e-commerce is still in pilot, as we touched on last quarter. I'll say before jumping into impact this quarter, it's the -- it's a super compelling product. Our team has done an amazing job building it. In all my years, it's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot. So, compared to the scale of our business inside gaming, it's too early for e-commerce to make a financial impact that's material. The step-up this quarter was entirely on the gaming side, which obviously is the vast majority of our advertising business today. We've talked for multiple quarters now about how there's a long runway in gaming. The gaming category has a need for more UA dollars spent, but it's constrained by the return on ad spend goals of the advertisers and the technology capabilities that a platform like us has today. Now, our technology continues to improve. We've got a long roadmap of enhancements that we can deliver to this platform. Because like I said in the talk script, these AI technologies are just really, really early in existence, both internally and externally. And all research advancements are going to let us really expand the business inside the gaming category. E-commerce, on the other hand, is looking so strong that it's something that we think will be impactful to the business financially '25 and then for the long term.\nMatt Stumpf: And in terms of the Google Cloud question, Clark, that you asked, so the renewal of our contract was slightly earlier than the planned renewal, but that was for us to really get capacity to support future growth. So, we signed up the contract and renewed in advance of kind of the normal timing of the end of that contract, but that was because we've had such fantastic success with the Software Platform thus far, and we wanted to continue to support that growth over the next couple of years.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. The only thing I'd add there too is Google has been a great partner for us on the cloud side. They've gotten us the compute that we need. We've got one of the largest GPU deployments in the world at this point, and we like to invest ahead of our needs so that we can continue to build more complicated models that'll help the business scale. So, when we make these investments, we're investing in infrastructure that is quarters ahead of where we are today in terms of consumption.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason?\nJason Bazinet: It's exciting to hear that you're excited about your e-commerce pilot. I just had one question as investors sort of think about the ramp of that business. Is there anything about it that could ramp more slowly, even if you're more excited about the efficacy of the product? And I'm thinking specifically about your brand just not being known in e-commerce circles and maybe you have to spend marketing dollars or hire a sales team or something that's just different than the brand name you have within the gaming ecosystem that could make it ramp more slowly even though it might be a better product or as good of a product. Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Good to see you, Jason. So, look, e-commerce is a new category for us. So, we do need brand awareness. That's a given. But our products are really good. And the key to when we started the business and doing so well in gaming is we took a really long-term approach. We said we're going to build a product that's so good that advertisers have to have it and we're not going to invest heavily in sales and we're going to organically grow over the years. And we've done that. And you can look at the trajectory of the company since we went public, but even if you backdate it to when we started, every year, we've gotten bigger and gotten more penetration into the gaming category and done it organically. So, when we look at e-commerce, we're not in any sort of rush. Now, that said, if you check even Twitter today, there's tons of noise from e-commerce brands saying in our pilot, they're seeing as much scale and as strong of ROAS as they're seeing anywhere in the world today on their user acquisition buy. So, when you have that kind of performance, you're delivering an automated return on ad spend model approach to a very large fragmented category like e-commerce that desperately needs another marketing channel after having so many promises in the past that haven't panned out. It's something that's probably going to get a lot of noise and be very attractive to the other side very quickly.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Matthew?\nMatthew Cost: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one is just on that e-commerce pilot. Sorry. Can you guys hear me?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah, we got you.\nMatt Stumpf: Yeah, we can hear you fine, Matt.\nMatthew Cost: Okay. Sorry. Yeah. So, the question is just on that e-commerce pilot. I guess given that you're, based on the results of the pilot, successfully expanding into other verticals and using AXON and the data available to you to target other types of advertising outside of gaming, do you have any reason to believe or any doubt about the ability to expand the model to cover other verticals other than just e-commerce? Because it seems like given the size of the audience and just the amount of data that you have to observe, it shouldn't necessarily just be limited to e-commerce. If you can move beyond gaming, do you believe you can move to other verticals? And I have one follow-up. Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Great question. 10 years from now, we think every advertiser that has a transactional model, whether it's collecting an e-mail address for a newsletter or a local pizza shop or an e-commerce brand or a gambling brand or a gaming brand or anything across any category can buy on our platform and do it at scale. So, there's no limitation to the power of the math and the technology that we that we've written, but the only limitation and the only reason why we reference it as e-commerce today is the go to market. We do want to be thoughtful about how we penetrate new categories. But even inside e-commerce, we're not approaching it as we're only going to go to fashion and then we're going to go to beauty. We're approaching it as we're going to go to the entirety of e-commerce and then we're going to go to the entirety of the rest of the categories of advertising that matter. And then, hopefully, we're going to go to the whole world of transactional businesses over time.\nMatthew Cost: Great. Thanks. And then, Matt, I just want to revisit and then you talked a little bit about this in the prepared remarks, capital allocation. So, the Board made a big increase to the buyback authorization this quarter. The stock, I think, aftermarket is up 450% year-to-date. Has that impacted your opinion of the attractiveness of buying back stock? And there's been some speculation in the press about a small M&A deal out there. Is M&A something that's on your guys' mind on the advertising side or do you have what you need?\nMatt Stumpf: Yeah. Maybe I'll do answer those in inverse order, Matt. So, on the M&A's front, we've been pretty consistent in communicating that our focus is really on growing the organic business and we have no plans, right, to do in any M&A at this point on the advertising side of the business. And, obviously, we've communicated in the past about the Apps business that we've optimized that for profitability, and we're comfortable in divesting that business if the opportunity arises. In terms of the buyback, really the stock price increase has no impact on our decision to continue to buy back our own shares. If we look at the company's long-term trajectory and the -- our goal in the future of growing the business 20% to 30% plus, we still feel like our stock is a great investment for shareholders.\nMatthew Cost: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Omar, please unmute.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Guys, I wanted to ask, whether the timing of your e-commerce solution for general availability has shifted at all since the last earnings call. And also, if you could update us on your thoughts about your go-to-market partners? If there's any more specificity you could give on that, that would be great. And then, I have a follow-up, which is more of an educational question for new investors.\nAdam Foroughi: All right. Great to see you, Omar. Good questions. So, timing wise, we're still on track. We're approaching it the same way as we always have. In pilot, we look at it as what we define as a pilot is what our people on the business team, which we run pretty lean as you know, can handle in terms of onboarding and really working with the advertiser closely to scale. General availability to us is a self-service state where advertisers of all types can just come into the platform and start marketing. And so, that's some point next year as we've touched on before. The one thing I'll say in terms of partners, we haven't disclosed any partners, but I referenced this a couple seconds ago. If you search Twitter, you're going to start seeing more and more noise because the customers are seeing a lot of success, and we're not going to be able to stop social media from talking about the successes that they're having on our platform. So that's the way you can really decipher which customers, how are they performing, and then what else is out there.\nOmar Dessouky: Awesome. Thank you. And so, just one more like educational question. Now the market cap of your stock has gone up much higher and is a lot closer and has eclipsed some online advertising and ad tech stocks that have been widely followed by investors for a long time. Some of them are in the OpenWeb, and I was wondering if you could explain, what are some aspects of the DSP ecosystem that you're in that lend itself to an arbitrage model, which is what I understand how it's run, as opposed to a percentage of gross ad spend model like we see in OpenWeb DSPs?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I guess, more specifically you're referencing Trade Desk versus our business models. Like, it's just two different approaches to the market. They've targeted the big agencies and taken a very smart software-as-a-service type of approach. And we've targeted brands and direct-to-consumer and e-commerce, gaming, game developers on the gaming side. And what these companies care about is not the media dollars or percentage markup. They care about optimization and automated advertising to a revenue goal. And that's really like what our system's predicated on is that we take all the risk on the media side. We have to deliver really compelling performance on the technology side. And I guess like what's most exciting for me on what we've built and where we are in terms of, like, you said, market cap and scale as a business today is we're on top of 1.4 billion daily actives. So, it's really easy to forget the scale of the audience reach that we have on our platform. We've got the largest mediation solution in the sector and our teams built maybe the most innovative advertising technology that the world's yet seen. And we're now scaling it out. And so, if you sort of just fast-forward over the quarters and the years from here, we're going to be able to service tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of advertisers on our platform to access this audience that they had never accessed before. And now, mobile devices, you think about the four hours to five hours a day of time spent, this is a 45-minute component of that four hours that is untapped for most of these advertisers. Our technology can now unlock it for them. And this was never possible historically on any platform. So, it gives us a lot of excitement that not only are we performing today, we've got a long runway to expand this platform and become one of the strongest companies the world's seen.\nOmar Dessouky: Thanks a lot, Adam. Appreciate it.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Thanks, Omar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kuntarich with UBS. Chris?\nChris Kuntarich: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one here on e-commerce. Adam, I think you had said on 2025, we should be starting to see a material contribution. We've been getting a lot of questions from investors just kind of how to be thinking about material. And just any tighter of a timeframe you could maybe help us understand? I know 1Q is seasonally weak for e-commerce, but could it be as soon as 1Q that we start to see a contribution from that business?\nAdam Foroughi: Look, we've said, we're confident in the 20% or 30% in gaming alone. This is sort of additive. I also just said it was the fastest growing product I've ever seen. So, it looks really good. Now, if we were scaled in e-commerce, we'd have seasonality in the business. We don't today really have seasonality in the business. When you're in pilot, you're talking about tens to hundreds total shops. And so, we're really just early stages here, but the performance is really strong. So, it's harder for us to predict how quickly it can ramp. And I do like to remind people that, when you have a scaled business, I think run rate wise, now $3.3 billion or so on this advertising business, that's really a lot of net revenue that we're reporting. Gross it up to total ad dollars on the platform and for e-commerce to really drive material impact, and let's define that by 10%-plus, is going to take some time to ramp up to, but we've never seen anything that looks like this in terms of strength in market. And so, if it does scale the way we think it will, it's going to make an impact in '25.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Very helpful. And maybe just one more. Shifting over to the licensing side, you've had this partnership with Flip app. Curious kind of what those learnings have been and kind of what that is influenced either from your e-commerce roadmap or how you think about potentially licensing AXON 2 out to other platforms.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. We talked about AXON licensing a couple of quarters ago. It's still something that we're working on, but in all fairness, to that product, it's sort of longer-term focus, not short-term focus. We're all hands on deck, both on the business side and the engineering side on scaling out what we think is this e-commerce scale out, and then broader than that, as I touched on to Matt's question a second ago. So, that's so just compelling that it's taken all of our resources now. We're trying to speed it up as much as we can with the resources we have available. That doesn't mean we're not excited about AXON licensing. It just means that that's going to come secondary to the opportunity in front of us on the other side.\nChris Kuntarich: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Heaney with Jefferies. James?\nJames Heaney: Great. Thanks for the question. Based on the revenue guidance for Q4, it imply you're at the very least going to enter 2025 growing Software Platform well above the 20% to 30% growth range that you've provided. Is there just any update you can share just in terms of how we should think about growth in 2025? Thank you.\nMatt Stumpf: We don't provide long-term guidance, James, on an annual basis. So, I mean, the 20% to 30%, which is kind of a -- it was a directional goal for the company. And we do think that as we drive directed model enhancements, we could get more than that. And as Adam mentioned before that 20% to 30% is also only including the existing mobile gaming opportunity. And so, any additional opportunity that we could -- that we see within e-commerce would be additive to that in the future.\nAdam Foroughi: And I think what we've told you all consistently is that 20% is based on just being in the market in gaming and then it goes up from there. And we can't predict these model enhancements. These are research lifts that the team delivers to the technology that is based on either internal research or external research is applicable to our tech stack. So, when you have that, it's not predictable, but it's very impactful. And so, when I talked about it last quarter, I said you get to 30% if you get one of those. Well, we've had multiple of those this year. So, obviously, the growth rate is over to 30%, right? So, there's no constraint on demand. There's no constraint on interest from our advertisers. If we're able to continuously improve the technology over the years faster than one material enhancement a year, then the growth rate is going to be higher than 30%.\nJames Heaney: Great. And then, maybe just one more. We heard Meta call out that they have over 1 million advertisers using GenAI for Creative. And I'm just curious, if you could talk maybe more about the timeline for potentially using GenAI features across more of your products and then just any of the benefits that you could see over time. Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: It's absolutely on our roadmap. It's super exciting. You can imagine today we serve static advertisements to all this audience of 1.4 billion. Over time, you'd imagine that the ad creative can become personalized and that would have a material lift to our business. We can't time it for you nor can we size it, because it's in our roadmap, but it's not in the immediate future. But it's something that we think is going to be very impactful and probably all advertising businesses are going to see a substantial response rate lift to the advertisements so that content gets personalized.\nJames Heaney: Great. Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, James.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Alec Brondolo with Wells Fargo. Alec?\nAlec Brondolo: Hey. Thanks so much for the question. Can you hear me okay?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. We can.\nAlec Brondolo: So, a lot of questions on the call tonight about kind of expanding the business into e-commerce and potentially beyond e-commerce from a demand perspective. I was hoping to get your thoughts on potentially expanding supply. My understanding is that almost all the ads are served in the mobile games ecosystem today. Obviously, there's a lot of ad supply outside of mobile games and there's no ways to tap into it programmatically. So, as you expand demand outside of mobile games, how do you think about potentially expanding your supply outside of mobile games?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. It's definitely another growth factor. So, I think of it -- on my last earnings call is the last bullet of the growth factors I laid out in my talk track. And so, supply expansion is something that's important to us. Right now, supply isn't our constraint. We think there's a lot of room to improve the way we monetize the 1.4 billion daily actives. But we did buy Wurl to tap into CTV. That's an immense amount of supply. That category today still doesn't have a really strong performance marketing platform, helping brands reach that audience through television in a very measurable way. So, you can imagine that's appealing to us. And then, you can just go out from there. So, if we fast-forward five years from now, we're certainly going to have more supply reach than just the mobile gaming side.\nAlec Brondolo: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nAdam Foroughi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mo Khallouf with HSBC.\nMo Khallouf: Yeah. Good afternoon, gentlemen, and congrats on your strong results. Just a quick one for me. In terms of the growth you're doing, obviously, it's phenomenal, but when we look at the mobile gaming market in terms of revenues or UA spend, the whole mobile market, it's well behind that. So, I'm just wondering, is it market share gains that's driving a lot of your growth. And can you continue to do that in terms of where you're positioned in the market?\nAdam Foroughi: Look, we're really big in gaming at this point, so it can't be market share gains because there's not a whole lot to go take. We've created a bigger market. So, we've talked about this and I think there's been some really good research that's been put out too that shows this category is now accelerating its growth rate driven by user acquisition. That's what drives the growth in mobile gaming. There's not new device growth. There's not new audience. The audience that we have is very stable, but these advertisers have a really deep and need -- strong need for more user acquisition. That's what drives their revenue. And nobody discloses what that user acquisition amount is. But as our platform has been getting better and better, it unlocks more dollars. They don't go, \"I can double my spend on AppLovin within my arbitrage goals, and then I'm going to go take from these other channels.\" They go, \"I can double my spend on AppLovin and keep spending on these other channels to expand my business and grow it faster.\" And so that's what you're seeing. And what you'll end up seeing over time is that the growth rates in the mobile gaming TAM will return to a pretty healthy clip so long as our platform continues to improve given we're the largest in the sector.\nMo Khallouf: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, you spoke a couple of quarters ago about the fact that AXON 2 is so good that you could put the open code out, and you don't think that there would be competitors who would be able to catch up with you, right? So, can you help us understand this e-commerce opportunity? Is it just taking AXON 2 as it is and just making minor tweaks so that it just selects for you targets of potential e-commerce customers, or is it a big overhaul? And then, how much of an advantage will you be able to take from the gaming and take it to e-commerce? And who -- if you can, whom will you be competing against? Who is currently taking up those budgets? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: So, it's a bunch of questions in there. So starting with, like, competition, I don't think to date, anyone has delivered a solution inside mobile games for categories outside of gaming. And so, we're going into greenfield. And what's exciting about these shops, and I said this on my talk track, when they're marketing on our platform today, this is a new audience. They're not otherwise able to reach this audience in that moment in time. So, when we're able to show an ad for them and do it precisely and measure it all, there's an immense amount of incremental value for them from that advertisement. So, it's a really strong solution for them. So, it will continue to make our platform able to monetize that audience better, which is going to be a huge boon for our business and very healthy for the publisher as well who will generate more dollars from their users, but also get more diversity of content to their users. And in this case, if you're a game publisher, an e-commerce ad is not for someone who is building another game, it's for something that is completely different than your product. So, it's a great win-win for all parties involved. On the technology side, I never like to talk about complexities of technology. I certainly wouldn't say anything we do is simple. I don't think a lot of people in the world, I mean, maybe hundreds, max, engineers understand how to build these types of platforms. We've seen very few, only a handful of software implementations that are compelling at scale inside what we're calling these AI technologies. And we're one of those. And our engineers are building really complicated technologies. They can do a lot more than just the first implementation did, which was drive performance marketing to gaming. So, we think there's going to be a lot of expansion opportunity over time. The technology platform is really powerful and math is not limited to categories. So, there's going to be, I think, years of growth ahead of us.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Martin Yang with OpCo. Martin?\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thank you. I have two questions. One on gaming, another on e-commerce. On gaming, do you think your customers are responding pretty consistently to step up in AXON 2.0's performance? Is there certain customers that will ramp up spending faster than the others?\nAdam Foroughi: So, Martin, our whole system is automated. So, there's not like -- I think last time I also said, like, every advertiser has more budget interest in spending on our platform than we can deliver on a daily basis. So, tomorrow, if someone, one of our engineers, somehow find some research that doubles the platform in terms of ability to match up and drive spend, everything will just double. So, there's not like a one or another. When we get these step functions, they all have a tolerance to spend more.\nMartin Yang: Got it. And then, on e-commerce, where are you spending or investing e-commerce? And is there any bottlenecks you're trying to break through as you ramp up e-commerce and then get it to commercial stage?\nAdam Foroughi: No. Like I said, it's the most exciting product that we've ever launched. We've never seen this kind of data on a new product. And if you recall, I mean, I don't voice optimism much since we've gone public on new products. We've talked about a lot of products. We are a very entrepreneurial company. We will try a lot of things, but the last time I talked about a really good product was when we launched AXON 2. That turned out pretty good for us, our company, our partners, and our investors. So, if we're talking about this product as being the most compelling one we've seen yet, you can assume we're not running into bottlenecks other than like we just don't have the capacity yet in terms of human capital and every solution -- component automated to scale it out as quickly as the market demands. We've got a line out the door at companies that want to jump onto this platform.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We will take our last question from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan. Cory?\nCory Carpenter: Hey. Good to see you all. I know this is a tough question to ask or answer, Adam, but just any insight you can give us into what the unlock was that contributed to the technical step function change in the quarter, or maybe why these unlocks seem to be happening more frequently now than they were going forward?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean, look, our team on the engineering and the research science side in particular, is one of the world's best. The people are really talented. They know these technologies, but it's a new field. And this field, both internally and externally has just a lot of interest in it. So, if you look at all the research that's being done externally, there's an immense amount of research that's been published over the last few years. And every time there's something that's interesting that's published or every time one of our researchers could figure something out from something published in the past or they create their own research and then incorporate it into the technology stack, we get more effective than what we do. And so, I'm not going to sit here and say I actually even understand this technology because it's way beyond my mathematical understanding. This team's exceptional, and they've been able to unlock an immense amount of opportunity for our platform and our business.\nCory Carpenter: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. The switch to probabilistic billing at iOS you made in August, is that something that had any notable impact on the business?\nAdam Foroughi: Not really. It was to make it more accurate and align with how advertisers tracked it, but the deltas were nominal.\nCory Carpenter: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. And that concludes the question-and-answer session for this quarter. We thank you all so much for joining us today. Have a good afternoon, and evening ahead.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks, everyone.\nMatt Stumpf: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Thank you all for joining us. We're excited to welcome a growing group of investors this quarter. Before we dive into our strong Q3 results, I want to emphasize the role that our culture plays as a fundamental strength in our business. Recently in Silicon Valley, much has been said about the importance of founder mode. While I'm a very hands-on founder, I believe that the key to our success lies not only in my hands-on approach, but more importantly, in surrounding myself with a team that shares a similar mindset and drive. Here are some defining traits of that mindset. We act like owners, treating the business with personal accountability. We approach each day with urgency and purpose. We have an insatiable desire to learn. We are driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence. We're constantly optimizing for diversity of thought and unity of ambition. We prioritize automation wherever possible. We don't get bogged down in overthinking. Instead, we make decisions and take action, adjusting quickly when needed. Our managers aren't just managers, they're doers, and expected to lead by example. We take pride in our profitability, with our business generating over $1.5 million in run rate adjusted EBITDA per employee, an efficiency we aim to improve. This quarter, I took on oversight of our HR function to ensure our culture thrives as we continue to grow. Now, turning to our quarterly performance. We continue to execute well, expanding our core business and laying the groundwork for sustained growth. Last quarter, I shared our confidence in achieving 20% to 30% year-over-year growth for the foreseeable future. We continue to expect 4% to 5% quarterly growth through self-learning and market growth, with occasional step changes resulting from enhancements to our AXON algorithm. This quarter, we saw one of those step changes, with meaningful growth driven by advancements to AXON. While we can't predict the timing of these breakthroughs, we're in the early stages of AI software development, both within our company and in the broader industry. We expect ongoing research advancements to continue driving our technology forward. While we remain confident in 20% to 30% growth for mobile gaming advertisers alone, we're also exploring new areas, as shown by our recent e-commerce pilot. Early data has exceeded our expectations, with the advertisers in the pilot seeing substantial returns, often surpassing those from other media channels, and in many cases, experiencing nearly a 100% incrementality from our traffic. We're increasingly confident this vertical will scale significantly in 2025 and become a strong contributor for us over the next year and beyond. To support this, we've streamlined resources and are reallocating talent from other initiatives to our e-commerce go-to-market team. In the next few quarters, we'll launch a self-service platform, opening global opportunities for advertisers of all sizes. Next, an update on our earnings communication. While we've been issuing quarterly shareholder letters, we believe businesses are built over years, not quarters. And to align with this vision, we will shift to an annual shareholder letter. Financial results and guidance will still be released quarterly, but each year, we'll provide a comprehensive summary of the past year and our plans for the future in the form of an annual shareholder letter. Finally, I'd like to thank our team for their outstanding execution and relentless drive. After 13 years, I'm continually inspired by the passion and excellence that define our company. We're in the early stages of building one of the world's most innovative technology platforms. The future is incredibly bright, and we have the right team to seize every opportunity in front of us. Now, I'll hand it off to Matt to run you through the financial details. Yeah. So, e-commerce is still in pilot, as we touched on last quarter. I'll say before jumping into impact this quarter, it's the -- it's a super compelling product. Our team has done an amazing job building it. In all my years, it's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot. So, compared to the scale of our business inside gaming, it's too early for e-commerce to make a financial impact that's material. The step-up this quarter was entirely on the gaming side, which obviously is the vast majority of our advertising business today. We've talked for multiple quarters now about how there's a long runway in gaming. The gaming category has a need for more UA dollars spent, but it's constrained by the return on ad spend goals of the advertisers and the technology capabilities that a platform like us has today. Now, our technology continues to improve. We've got a long roadmap of enhancements that we can deliver to this platform. Because like I said in the talk script, these AI technologies are just really, really early in existence, both internally and externally. And all research advancements are going to let us really expand the business inside the gaming category. E-commerce, on the other hand, is looking so strong that it's something that we think will be impactful to the business financially '25 and then for the long term. Yeah. The only thing I'd add there too is Google has been a great partner for us on the cloud side. They've gotten us the compute that we need. We've got one of the largest GPU deployments in the world at this point, and we like to invest ahead of our needs so that we can continue to build more complicated models that'll help the business scale. So, when we make these investments, we're investing in infrastructure that is quarters ahead of where we are today in terms of consumption. Yeah. Good to see you, Jason. So, look, e-commerce is a new category for us. So, we do need brand awareness. That's a given. But our products are really good. And the key to when we started the business and doing so well in gaming is we took a really long-term approach. We said we're going to build a product that's so good that advertisers have to have it and we're not going to invest heavily in sales and we're going to organically grow over the years. And we've done that. And you can look at the trajectory of the company since we went public, but even if you backdate it to when we started, every year, we've gotten bigger and gotten more penetration into the gaming category and done it organically. So, when we look at e-commerce, we're not in any sort of rush. Now, that said, if you check even Twitter today, there's tons of noise from e-commerce brands saying in our pilot, they're seeing as much scale and as strong of ROAS as they're seeing anywhere in the world today on their user acquisition buy. So, when you have that kind of performance, you're delivering an automated return on ad spend model approach to a very large fragmented category like e-commerce that desperately needs another marketing channel after having so many promises in the past that haven't panned out. It's something that's probably going to get a lot of noise and be very attractive to the other side very quickly. Yeah, we got you. Yeah. Great question. 10 years from now, we think every advertiser that has a transactional model, whether it's collecting an e-mail address for a newsletter or a local pizza shop or an e-commerce brand or a gambling brand or a gaming brand or anything across any category can buy on our platform and do it at scale. So, there's no limitation to the power of the math and the technology that we that we've written, but the only limitation and the only reason why we reference it as e-commerce today is the go to market. We do want to be thoughtful about how we penetrate new categories. But even inside e-commerce, we're not approaching it as we're only going to go to fashion and then we're going to go to beauty. We're approaching it as we're going to go to the entirety of e-commerce and then we're going to go to the entirety of the rest of the categories of advertising that matter. And then, hopefully, we're going to go to the whole world of transactional businesses over time. All right. Great to see you, Omar. Good questions. So, timing wise, we're still on track. We're approaching it the same way as we always have. In pilot, we look at it as what we define as a pilot is what our people on the business team, which we run pretty lean as you know, can handle in terms of onboarding and really working with the advertiser closely to scale. General availability to us is a self-service state where advertisers of all types can just come into the platform and start marketing. And so, that's some point next year as we've touched on before. The one thing I'll say in terms of partners, we haven't disclosed any partners, but I referenced this a couple seconds ago. If you search Twitter, you're going to start seeing more and more noise because the customers are seeing a lot of success, and we're not going to be able to stop social media from talking about the successes that they're having on our platform. So that's the way you can really decipher which customers, how are they performing, and then what else is out there. Yeah. I guess, more specifically you're referencing Trade Desk versus our business models. Like, it's just two different approaches to the market. They've targeted the big agencies and taken a very smart software-as-a-service type of approach. And we've targeted brands and direct-to-consumer and e-commerce, gaming, game developers on the gaming side. And what these companies care about is not the media dollars or percentage markup. They care about optimization and automated advertising to a revenue goal. And that's really like what our system's predicated on is that we take all the risk on the media side. We have to deliver really compelling performance on the technology side. And I guess like what's most exciting for me on what we've built and where we are in terms of, like, you said, market cap and scale as a business today is we're on top of 1.4 billion daily actives. So, it's really easy to forget the scale of the audience reach that we have on our platform. We've got the largest mediation solution in the sector and our teams built maybe the most innovative advertising technology that the world's yet seen. And we're now scaling it out. And so, if you sort of just fast-forward over the quarters and the years from here, we're going to be able to service tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of advertisers on our platform to access this audience that they had never accessed before. And now, mobile devices, you think about the four hours to five hours a day of time spent, this is a 45-minute component of that four hours that is untapped for most of these advertisers. Our technology can now unlock it for them. And this was never possible historically on any platform. So, it gives us a lot of excitement that not only are we performing today, we've got a long runway to expand this platform and become one of the strongest companies the world's seen. Yeah. Thanks, Omar. Look, we've said, we're confident in the 20% or 30% in gaming alone. This is sort of additive. I also just said it was the fastest growing product I've ever seen. So, it looks really good. Now, if we were scaled in e-commerce, we'd have seasonality in the business. We don't today really have seasonality in the business. When you're in pilot, you're talking about tens to hundreds total shops. And so, we're really just early stages here, but the performance is really strong. So, it's harder for us to predict how quickly it can ramp. And I do like to remind people that, when you have a scaled business, I think run rate wise, now $3.3 billion or so on this advertising business, that's really a lot of net revenue that we're reporting. Gross it up to total ad dollars on the platform and for e-commerce to really drive material impact, and let's define that by 10%-plus, is going to take some time to ramp up to, but we've never seen anything that looks like this in terms of strength in market. And so, if it does scale the way we think it will, it's going to make an impact in '25. Yeah. We talked about AXON licensing a couple of quarters ago. It's still something that we're working on, but in all fairness, to that product, it's sort of longer-term focus, not short-term focus. We're all hands on deck, both on the business side and the engineering side on scaling out what we think is this e-commerce scale out, and then broader than that, as I touched on to Matt's question a second ago. So, that's so just compelling that it's taken all of our resources now. We're trying to speed it up as much as we can with the resources we have available. That doesn't mean we're not excited about AXON licensing. It just means that that's going to come secondary to the opportunity in front of us on the other side. And I think what we've told you all consistently is that 20% is based on just being in the market in gaming and then it goes up from there. And we can't predict these model enhancements. These are research lifts that the team delivers to the technology that is based on either internal research or external research is applicable to our tech stack. So, when you have that, it's not predictable, but it's very impactful. And so, when I talked about it last quarter, I said you get to 30% if you get one of those. Well, we've had multiple of those this year. So, obviously, the growth rate is over to 30%, right? So, there's no constraint on demand. There's no constraint on interest from our advertisers. If we're able to continuously improve the technology over the years faster than one material enhancement a year, then the growth rate is going to be higher than 30%. It's absolutely on our roadmap. It's super exciting. You can imagine today we serve static advertisements to all this audience of 1.4 billion. Over time, you'd imagine that the ad creative can become personalized and that would have a material lift to our business. We can't time it for you nor can we size it, because it's in our roadmap, but it's not in the immediate future. But it's something that we think is going to be very impactful and probably all advertising businesses are going to see a substantial response rate lift to the advertisements so that content gets personalized. Thanks, James. Yeah. We can. Yeah. It's definitely another growth factor. So, I think of it -- on my last earnings call is the last bullet of the growth factors I laid out in my talk track. And so, supply expansion is something that's important to us. Right now, supply isn't our constraint. We think there's a lot of room to improve the way we monetize the 1.4 billion daily actives. But we did buy Wurl to tap into CTV. That's an immense amount of supply. That category today still doesn't have a really strong performance marketing platform, helping brands reach that audience through television in a very measurable way. So, you can imagine that's appealing to us. And then, you can just go out from there. So, if we fast-forward five years from now, we're certainly going to have more supply reach than just the mobile gaming side. Thank you. Look, we're really big in gaming at this point, so it can't be market share gains because there's not a whole lot to go take. We've created a bigger market.

            "content": "Good afternoon. We had another fantastic quarter, with total revenue reaching $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $722 million, achieving a 60% adjusted EBITDA margin. This marks a 39% increase in revenue and a 72% increase in adjusted EBITDA from the same period last year, translating to an impressive 91% flow-through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA. In the third quarter, we generated $545 million in free cash flow. That's up 182% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, our free cash flow grew 22%, consistent with adjusted EBITDA growth over the same period, and representing 76% flow-through from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, we had $568 million in cash and cash equivalents, and 335 million shares outstanding. During the quarter, improvements in our AXON technology, driven by ongoing self-learning and enhancements by our engineering team, contributed to further growth of our Software Platform. This segment generated $835 million in revenue and $653 million in adjusted EBITDA, achieving a 78% margin and growing 66% in revenue and 79% in adjusted EBITDA from the same period last year. Quarter-over-quarter flow-through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA was 107%. Our Software Platform adjusted EBITDA this quarter was positively impacted by several non-recurring cost benefits associated with the renewal of our Google Cloud contract, PSU vesting in the prior quarter, and foreign exchange. On a normalized basis, we estimate our quarter-over-quarter flow-through would be approximately 100%. Next quarter, we expect software flow-through to reduce slightly as a result of PSU-related vesting costs and an increase in data center capacity to support future growth. As our core advertising business now represents substantially all of our Software Platform revenue and future focus for the company, starting with our next shareholder letter and annual 10-K, we will rename our Software Platform and associated revenue to Advertising to better align with the nature of this business. Our Apps revenue for the quarter was $363 million, a 1% increase from last year, with $68 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 19% margin. We continue to expect the Apps business to be stable in the future. We believe a strong capital structure and effective capital allocation plan are crucial to the creation of long-term shareholder value. To that end, we're focused on a few areas. First and foremost, to drive organic growth by recruiting top talent and investing in our technology in the most lean and cost efficient way possible. Second, to manage our outstanding shares through ongoing repurchases funded from free cash flow and prudent equity grants to employees. This quarter, we retired and withheld a total of 5 million shares for a total cost of $437 million. To further our share management efforts, we also received our Board's approval to increase our repurchase authorization by $2 billion, bringing our remaining authorization to a total of $2.3 billion. And third, to build a strong capital foundation, with sufficient liquidity to support financial flexibility with a net debt leverage ratio below 2 times. Finally, turning to our financial guidance for next quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate to deliver between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion in revenue, with adjusted EBITDA between $740 million and $760 million, targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 60%. Now with that, let's move to Q&A. And in terms of the Google Cloud question, Clark, that you asked, so the renewal of our contract was slightly earlier than the planned renewal, but that was for us to really get capacity to support future growth. So, we signed up the contract and renewed in advance of kind of the normal timing of the end of that contract, but that was because we've had such fantastic success with the Software Platform thus far, and we wanted to continue to support that growth over the next couple of years. Yeah, we can hear you fine, Matt. Yeah. Maybe I'll do answer those in inverse order, Matt. So, on the M&A's front, we've been pretty consistent in communicating that our focus is really on growing the organic business and we have no plans, right, to do in any M&A at this point on the advertising side of the business. And, obviously, we've communicated in the past about the Apps business that we've optimized that for profitability, and we're comfortable in divesting that business if the opportunity arises. In terms of the buyback, really the stock price increase has no impact on our decision to continue to buy back our own shares. If we look at the company's long-term trajectory and the -- our goal in the future of growing the business 20% to 30% plus, we still feel like our stock is a great investment for shareholders. We don't provide long-term guidance, James, on an annual basis. So, I mean, the 20% to 30%, which is kind of a -- it was a directional goal for the company. And we do think that as we drive directed model enhancements, we could get more than that. And as Adam mentioned before that 20% to 30% is also only including the existing mobile gaming opportunity. And so, any additional opportunity that we could -- that we see within e-commerce would be additive to that in the future. Thank you."

        "content": "David Hsiao: Welcome to the AppLovin Earnings Call for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024. I'm David Hsiao, Head of Investor Relations. Joining me today to discuss our results are Adam Foroughi, our Co-Founder, CEO, and Chairperson; and Matt Stumpf, our CFO. Please note our SEC filings to date as well as our shareholder letter and press release discussing our second quarter are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our products and services, market expectations, the expected future financial performance of the company, and other future events. These statements are based on our current assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them except as required by law. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended, March 31, 2024. Additional information may also be found on our quarterly report and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, which will be filed later today. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be superior to or a substitute for our GAAP results. Please be sure to review the reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and shareholder letter available on our Investor Relations site. This conference call is being recorded and a replay will be available for a period of time on our IR website. Now, I'll turn it over to Adam and Matt for some opening remarks, then we'll have the moderator take us through Q&A.\nAdam Foroughi: Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We had another strong quarter in Q2. Our software business had 5% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter because our models continue to improve. As you'll recall, in Q1, we had a big step-up in growth, so continuing that trend to continue to grow quarter-over-quarter is a really promising sign. As we've stated in previous earnings calls, if we keep growing the software business, the flow through to EBITDA and cash is very high and our business margins and cash conversion will continue to improve. We've also consistently said that the slower growth market we're in, mobile gaming doesn't constrain our opportunity to grow our software business. We've noticed that at times, this concept is needed a little bit more explaining for our shareholders and prospective investors. So, I wanted to take the time to do that here. Our platform is entirely performance based. In other words, gaming advertisers who market on our platform generate a measurable revenue and profit from the dollars they spend on our platform. Our customers run marketing campaigns with target return goals, but tend to have a much higher appetite for spend on our platform than we can deliver today. And why can't we deliver more today? Because our current system can only find a limited number of users who will meet their revenue goals. As our technology improves, we will continue to find more users who achieve these goals, increasing advertiser spend, resulting in materially higher growth than the growth rate of the mobile gaming market. Last quarter, I talked about a goal of growing our software business 20% to 30% for the long term. I typically don't communicate externally about our goals if I don't have confidence in it. I'm communicating it now because I do have strong confidence in it and I see many years of growth ahead of us. Here are the primary drivers of that growth goal. Continued improvement from our models as they learn from more data. As our models gather more data, they'll become more accurate and find more good users for our advertisers, gains that our team delivers to the efficacy of our models through enhancements. Our research, science, and core engineering team members are exceptionally talented and consistently deliver lifts to the performance of our models. Demand expansion into new verticals, we just launched the first web advertising campaigns for shops this quarter. And while in pilot right now, we think it will unlock a lot of demand expansion opportunities for us. And then supply expansion, as we broaden out our demand base outside of gaming, we expect the new categories will really help grow our CTV footprint. We continue to be very excited about our prospects and the performance our team is able to deliver. We will work tirelessly to achieve the goals we set and hope that over the next many quarters and years together, you will have a better sense of how an AI driven marketing platform creates growth opportunities that just weren't possible in advertising before because technologies were not this sophisticated. With that, I'll hand it off to Matt to run you through the financial highlights.\nMatt Stumpf: Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to report we had another strong quarter with total revenue reaching $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $601 million, achieving a 56% adjusted EBITDA margin. This marks a 44% increase in revenue and an 80% increase in adjusted EBITDA from the same-period last year, translating to an impressive 81% flow through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter, we generated $446 million in free cash flow, which is a 74% flow through from adjusted EBITDA. Quarter-over-quarter, our free cash flow grew 15% compared to 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA over the same period as we benefited from a relatively stable base of cash tax and interest. During the quarter, improvement in our AXON technology driven by ongoing self-learning contributed to further growth of our software platform, which generated $711 million in revenue and $520 million in adjusted EBITDA, retaining our 73% margin and growing 91% from the same period last year. This represents an 87% flow through of revenue from the prior quarter, illustrating our ability to remain disciplined with our costs, growing revenue while remaining lean and efficient. Our apps revenue for the quarter was $369 million, an increase of 7% from last year with $81 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 22% margin. During the quarter, we readjusted our user acquisition return goals, resulting in an 11% quarter-over-quarter decrease in total app segment costs, while revenue decreased by 3%. We expect our future margin profile to normalize to approximately 15% over the long term, consistent with industry standards. Looking ahead to capital allocation, we plan to focus on three key areas. First, investment in organic growth initiatives, specifically our engineering and business development headcount to support the development of our AXON technology and expansion into e-commerce. We do not expect significant capital investment here since we plan to expand our teams in a very lean and targeted manner. Second, continued share management activities with the combination of withhold to cover on future share vesting and strategic repurchases. And third, strengthening of our balance sheet to enhance operational flexibility and liquidity while reducing net debt. In Q2, we used $356 million to withhold 4.2 million shares, allocating about 80% of our free cash flow in the quarter to share management. Since 2022, we have invested nearly $3 billion to repurchase and withhold a combined 83.6 million shares. Finally, in the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate to deliver between $1.115 billion and $1.135 billion in revenue with adjusted EBITDA between $630 million and $650 million, targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 57%. Now with that, let's move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Matt. And again, like Matt mentioned, we will now take your questions. When I call your name, please turn on your video and go ahead and unmute yourself as well. And we will take as many questions as time permits. Our first question is going to come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason, please go ahead with your question. And go ahead and turn-on your video as well if you wouldn't mind, Jason. All right, Jason. I see that you're out there go ahead unmute yourself and turn on your video.\nJason Bazinet: Well, it says the host won't let me do my videos, I can't do that part, but I'm...\nOperator: Got it. All right. You can do it now, sorry about that Jason, that's my fault.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a quick question on some of the initiatives you guys are pursuing outside of gaming. I know it's still a little bit early, but you said some of these products were in beta. But can you just sort of refresh us on, sort of, what your ambitions are and anything that you've learned so far and when you think it might be sort of something that is large enough where the Street could care about it? Is it a '25 or '26 event, just some sort of dimensionalization of the timing? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Good to see, Jason. In the quarter, Q2, we launched pilot of our web advertising program and this allows -- let's talk about e-commerce first. This allows an e-commerce shop that has a website to buy on our in-app inventory, the billion-plus daily active users we see in mobile gaming, a video advertisement routes that user to their shop and purchase that user in the same way that mobile game companies like purchasing users on our platform. So, doing it on a performance basis and then we're delivering them measurable revenue and results. This is brand-new. I'd say it's been in pilot for a few months now. Results are looking really promising, materially better than what we would have expected this early in our progression in trying to get into web advertising. So this product, we think is something that we're going to invest heavily behind, start scaling out and hopefully will show a material impact in '25 and beyond. And it is not limited to just e-commerce. It opens the door to advertising for any website of any type that wants to drive transactions that are measurable on a performance basis on our platform.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you very much.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric -- my apologies, Clark Lampen with BTIG. Please go ahead, Clark.\nClark Lampen: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hopefully you can see and hear me. Adam -- perfect. So Adam, if we look at the third quarter guidance and we sort of assume that apps trends are relatively similar to what we saw last year, there's sort of an implied comp adjusted reacceleration in the software business. And I'm going to guess that it's going to be driven by that sort of first primary driver that you mentioned, sort of model improvements and sort of the learnings that go on. But one, I guess I'm curious if you could give us a sense of what's actually driving acceleration against tougher comps now. And then, maybe what that sort of for the back half into '25?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean, look, when we've talked about this growth goal, if you just think about the growth goal in terms of mobile gaming in the business that we have today, we just grew 5% quarter-over-quarter, the numbers are getting pretty big. Q1 was materially more. It was in the teens quarter-over-quarter. We've always talked about like the model is going to continue to improve itself and pick up a few points of growth every single quarter just from that enhancement. But then the team is also trying to apply enhancements on top. When we get lifts from the team, those can be step-function. Like, we saw in Q1, you wouldn't expect Q1 having double-digit growth over Q4. And so we're seeing really good trends in Q3. The business is still very strong. We've got a lot of momentum with our customers. They continue to see us as really the main channel now in mobile gaming advertising. And around and behind that, we're also now seeing exciting trends in what we just talked about, the web advertising category. So we've got a lot of optimism going into the next quarter.\nClark Lampen: Okay. And if I could, Matt, year-to-date, you've repurchased around $1.1 billion of stock. The guidance implies both an uptick in margins and higher incrementals if we take sort of apps margins at 15%, I think, as you just said, how do you think about, I guess, as the free cash flow profile of the business is improving, maybe being a little bit more tactical with the buyback in periods where there is a bigger dislocation between the market price and then what you guys view as intrinsic value? Thanks a lot.\nMatt Stumpf: Yeah. Sure, Clark. So our plan currently is to continue kind of the historical trend of continuing to manage our shares through withhold the cover on shares that are vesting each quarter. And then on a strategic basis, we'll continue to do supplemental repurchases in addition to the quarterly investing.\nOperator: Thanks, Clark. And we'll move on to James Heaney with Jefferies.\nJames Heaney: Great. Hey, guys and thanks for taking the questions. Could you just talk more about the 20% to 30% long-term software platform growth that you referenced? And I'm curious just how dependent that goal is on verticals beyond gaming? And I just had one more follow-up.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. We don't think it's very dependent outside of gaming at all. You've got a mobile gaming category. It's got a few percentage points of growth a year now. So let's call that low-single digits. You've got a business that as these models continue to improve from gathering more data, we think that's an extra 3%, 4% a quarter as well. So, that sort of gets you to the low end. And then we've got a team that's constantly working on improving the models and any improvement that's actually develop or driven enhancement to the models that makes them more accurate, then steps you up into the higher-end of that range. And so we've got a lot of confidence in the growth goal we put out there just on a baseline basis the current business. Now, we do the with current business now we do sit on 1 billion plus daily active users. We've got one of the most sophisticated advertising platforms in the world and we're driving billions of dollars of performance value in gaming. There's nothing about the technology we have that would disallow it from going outside of just mobile gaming, and we're already seeing positive trends in that pilot. So as we start putting these pieces together and broaden out our platform over time, we're really excited about how big the numbers could become.\nJames Heaney: Great. And then just one more follow-up on the -- just the overall health of the mobile gaming market. I think you've in the past talked about 3% to 4% industry growth. So curious if you're seeing any change in those trends?\nAdam Foroughi: No. And we're not seeing any change in the aggregate, but you also have to remember our market is a little bit different. We're driven in large part by advertising based applications growing audience. So that 1 billion plus daily active users are inside of apps that run advertisements. You monetize those apps partially with games that generate purchases, partially with games that generate purchases and advertising. And so that number isn't documented anywhere, but we're seeing the overall IP market, everyone can look at industry reports and see it growing low-single digits. We're also seeing the advertising-supported market grow faster than that.\nJames Heaney: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now hear from Omar Dessouky with BofA. And Adam and Matt, just to let you know, he is on audio only.\nAdam Foroughi: Great. Omar.\nOmar Dessouky: Yeah. Hey, guys. I'm on audio only. Thanks. So look, I'm -- just looking at your third-quarter guidance, if I were to back-out the apps business, I kind of get a number that sort of 50% year-on-year in the third quarter, which is still a pretty far off from the 20% to 30% long-term growth that you talked about. So, I think myself and a lot of people would kind of want to know like what is potentially that trajectory going from software business of maybe 50% year-over-year next quarter eventually to that 20%, 30%. Do you have any visibility into the first couple of quarters of 2025 yet that you're able to share with us?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So we don't provide long-term guidance. Obviously, we're only looking a quarter ahead. As Clark touched on, you can sort of deduce where that software business we're guiding to on the upcoming quarter. It's still -- if you start adding up the quarters to get into 20%, 30%, you want to see 5%, 6%, 7% quarter-over-quarter growth. We think we can be confidently in those ranges for quite some time, we see a lot of opportunity to grow. Now that removes any opportunity for step function gains and model enhancements driven by the team. That also does not include really any sort of thought given to what new categories are going to contribute to our business long-term because frankly, again, they're in pilot. So, we're not backing those numbers into longer-term views on the business. So we think we're going to be in a place where this business is going to be steady, it's going to be growing at a very nice rate and the conversion in cash flow is only going to improve and we've got a lot of other exciting things that are going on that give us confidence that we could even be above those ranges.\nClark Lampen: Okay. Could I just ask you another quick question? So in terms of the opportunity for in-app advertising, some of the checks that I did suggest that there were some improvements there. So, I think the in-app -- the in-app purchase market is somewhere around $100 billion. The in-app advertising market a lot smaller is somewhere maybe between $20 billion and $30 billion is my estimate. Does your technology really drive advertising revenues for publishers as well and potentially turn that into a growth market and could that make a major difference in your software business?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Also, look, that market already is growing much faster than the in-app purchasing market because it's just at a smaller base. We're also -- the MAX platform we've touched on in the past, the majority of the mobile gaming and app advertising market is running through that MAX auction. That MAX auction has gone from the inefficient world of waterfall to programmatic bidding. Vast, vast majority of the auction is now in a bidding state and so it's continuously gotten more efficient. Our advertising has also gotten a lot more efficient. So as you've seen our business doubling in the last year, there's billions of dollars of more investment happening for mobile gaming companies and user acquisition and user discovery. Some part of that is in-app advertising advertisers and that's helped be a catalyst to regrowing this industry as a whole in-app purchasing. But some portion of that also is are these publishers that are buying more users now because our systems are more effective for advertising based applications are so -- but all of this stuff is intertangled together and we're one of the main catalysts of growth in this category because our scale is so large inside this category on both fronts.\nOmar Dessouky: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball has the next question and is also audio only.\nVasily Karasyov: Yes. Apologies for that. Good afternoon. Adam, I think on the previous call, you mentioned that the big publishers started spending with you and before that they were not because they see -- they saw you as a competitor. So I was wondering how the trend continued this quarter. Do you still see them coming in bigger, bigger buckets? And then does that open up a significant corner of the market that you sort of could not address before? Would appreciate your thoughts here. Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean, look, like at this level of scale with how big the software business is, if you backed out total advertiser dollars that you think are in our platform, it's in the many billions of dollars. So we've always worked with some of the very large publishers like we usually have had pretty deep penetration in mobile gaming, but there are some very well-known large publishers that did look at us as a competitor. At this point, our platform is so successful in mobile gaming, it's very, very hard for any publisher to look the other way. And so we've gotten a lot more adoption across even those publishers. There isn't really a customer that I know of in mobile gaming that does not find success -- scalable success on our platform at this point today.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Mohammad Azharuddin with HSBC Mohammed do you want to turn your video on Mohammed, if you can hear me, go-ahead and unmute yourself so we can at least hear you to ask your question. Well hearing no response we'll move on to Matt Cost with Morgan Stanley.\nMatt Cost: Great. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess when I think about e-commerce advertising kind of an in-app environment or an in-game environment, as I understand it today because of the AppLovin exchange, which should allow people like Google or Trade Desk to access the inventory on MAX to run e-commerce ads today, that should be possible, but it doesn't seem like it's a very big business today. So I guess, what are the impediments to running e-commerce advertising in an in-game or in-app environment that are preventing others from doing it already since I believe it should be possible. And then how are you solving those problems or aiming to solve them with your e-commerce product? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Like, we can't speak to other people's technologies or things that prohibit them from being able to get categories to work in gaming, but Trade Desk products are nothing like ours. When it comes to succeeding on behalf of advertisers, in any category, we want our models to be able to drive measurable revenue. So you got to have an attribution framework, you've got to have models that can predict revenue and match the user up with the advertiser and you've got to make it all work together. We're in pilot with this product right now. It's looking quite promising. And so we think it's something that we're going to be able to build on and build on very aggressively as we go forward.\nMatt Cost: Yeah. And just to follow up on that. I guess from a data perspective, is it just a matter of iterating on it? I mean, because obviously you have so much data that's specifically relevant to kind of like the game advertising products you've done historically. Is that applicable directly to e-commerce advertising or other verticals or is it about iterating and kind of building a new data-set?\nAdam Foroughi: No, I think it's a combination of both. I mean, we process tens of billions of dollars of transactional volume already, and we see $1 billion-plus daily active. So our platform is not small at this point. And that data is able to be used across anything. These are human beings, not just mobile gamers and the audience skews female and middle-aged. And so it's completely different than what people would assume a gaming audience is at a very, very large scale, directly applicable to e-commerce is something that we've always hypothesized as possible. The models in AXON 2 are so much more sophisticated than in technologies we've had in the past that they should enable success there. Now we're in pilot and we're seeing success there. So we're at the point now where we know we put the pieces in place and now it's more of a go-to-market problem and less of a technology problem.\nMatt Cost: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [indiscernible] with Wolfe has the next question.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So looking at AppDiscovery installations growing 77% on a tough comp and revenue per installation accelerating versus last quarter. I guess just is there any strength in installations from non-gaming? I know it's small revenue base today, but in terms of app discovery installations, is it a more material portion of that growth? And then just aside from that, any types of -- could you go into a little bit more detail on how you're still seeing that strong strength in installations and revenue per installation? Then just a follow-up on the apps business. Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah, sure. Sure,. So the non-gaming continues to grow, but it's still a relatively small portion of the overall installations when you look at the overall software business. So to Adam's previous comments, like it's still a relatively small portion of the existing business and it's still kind of in pilot mode there. So we continue to see kind of promising results, but it's really not needing today.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. And then just on apps, despite the dip in monthly active payers, you saw, I think when you back it out in-app advertising basically flat sequentially. Is this a function of the strength from AXON 2? And also on apps, do you plan on exploring any divestiture studios? Some people were talking about wanting to add more studios. Does that -- would that support some of your capital allocation plans in the medium term? Thanks.\nAdam Foroughi: I mean, like we've said in the past about M&A and divesting the apps businesses, we continue to be open to it and we're really just waiting for the market to improve. And we've been optimizing the app studios over the last over a year. So, you can see that as well, right, in this quarter where we've adjusted the return goals for our UA spend, decreasing costs pretty materially and increasing our margin profile. So, we'll continue to maximize those businesses for-profit and we'll be open to transactions in the future.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We have time for one additional question from Martin Yang with OpCo. Sorry about that, Martin.\nMartin Yang: Thank you for taking my question. I want to dig a little deeper into your confidence on that 35% constant improvement on a sequential basis. What gave you the type of confidence because I look at the underlying market and your customer behavior, it's a very dynamic market for mobile gaming with new game launches, certain games performing worse or better and customers are doing all sort of things. So, what is a constant in that type of market that gave you the confidence that your improvement can be pretty consistent on a quarterly basis?\nAdam Foroughi: Yang you said 35% sequential quarter-over-quarter.\nMartin Yang: 3% to 5%\nAdam Foroughi: So, there's two components, right, like one is the market growth, which we can all say is low-single digits. One is just models getting better every single quarter because they see more data and they get more accurate. And that's -- these models by definition, this is how they work. And so we see that in real-time, the models continue to get more accurate. Now our advertisers and I said this in my talk track, our advertisers will spend much more today on our platform that we can deliver to them. The limitation is how many users can the models match-up on across every single one of those advertisers at those revenue goals. If the models get better, they're able to process more data and find more users for those advertisers, so the spend will go up naturally. And it's not that these advertisers are adding more budget, it's not that they're saying, we want to buy users at a more expensive cost to them by definition, lowering their goals. It's that the models get better, all else stays equal and these advertisers grow on our platform. And so we're seeing that in real-time. And there is a very, very large appetite for incremental spend on our platform because we deliver profits to these advertisers. They're arbitrage marketing on us, they are buying at a profit. And so they will spend a lot more if our models can do it. And so those two things can build out a very good sustainable growth rate inside the mobile gaming category. And then the third piece is, if you end up having a lift to the form of technology that you're using, you materially enhance that technology. And in the past have used like ChatGPT 3.5 for these are incremental changes that are step functions in these types of technologies and I use that as an analogy because people understand it. But in our world, we're constantly making enhancements to the technology. When there is a lift to the technology, that could be a step-function in growth for the same reason because these advertisers will spend more and it can make our models more accurate at larger-scale on behalf of them. So hopefully that answers for you, Martin.\nMartin Yang: Yeah. A quick follow-up. So are you saying that the key inputs to your own model improvement is primarily volume-driven or the volume data driven?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean, look, we're a very, very large-scale, right? So that data creates a moat. And the more data our models process, the better they're going to get. So every single quarter, we launch the system, we just went and lapped the one-year anniversary, right? So it's been in the market now for a year-plus. Every month has been bigger than the prior month. So we get more data, processes more data with those incremental data points, the math gets stronger, the model gets stronger and it can drive more value. And so we've seen that consistently. These AI technologies are very, very new. So it's not like in the world, we have 10 years of history to look-back on and go, when do these models stop improving themselves. They currently are doing that today. That's by nature, that's how this AI technology works, processes immense amounts of data and through that, the math gets stronger and more accurate and more predictive. And so we're seeing that in real time. That gives us confidence that this core underlying technology is going to continue to grow over time.\nMartin Yang: Got it. You talked about matching. Is there a sense you can give us on how accurately are you matching the users to the apps now and how much more accurate it can be in the future?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I mean, look, we're very, very accurate today. When an advertiser says, I want to break even in 30 days on our platform, we achieve that goal for them. When I say increasing the match rate, it means let's say that advertiser says, I want to spend $1,000 today and I want to get the $1,000 back in 30 days and we get that within a percent of inaccuracy. So they get whether it's $990 or $1,010 back in 30 days that we have a limit of $1,000 that they can spend today, though the system can only deliver that much with a very low error rate for them. Now let's say tomorrow the system processes more data or our team makes an enhancement and now the system can deliver $2,000 at that same 30-day breakeven. The advertiser is going to say, I got the $2,000 ready to go. You're breakeven in 30 days, I'll put it on my credit card. Well, they have unlimited tolerance to spend, if all else remains equal and as our technology continues to improve, that business will continue to grow.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nOperator: Well, this concludes our question-and-answer session and today's webinar. We thank you all for your participation and we look forward to seeing you all next quarter. You may now disconnect. Enjoy your summer.",

            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We had another strong quarter in Q2. Our software business had 5% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter because our models continue to improve. As you'll recall, in Q1, we had a big step-up in growth, so continuing that trend to continue to grow quarter-over-quarter is a really promising sign. As we've stated in previous earnings calls, if we keep growing the software business, the flow through to EBITDA and cash is very high and our business margins and cash conversion will continue to improve. We've also consistently said that the slower growth market we're in, mobile gaming doesn't constrain our opportunity to grow our software business. We've noticed that at times, this concept is needed a little bit more explaining for our shareholders and prospective investors. So, I wanted to take the time to do that here. Our platform is entirely performance based. In other words, gaming advertisers who market on our platform generate a measurable revenue and profit from the dollars they spend on our platform. Our customers run marketing campaigns with target return goals, but tend to have a much higher appetite for spend on our platform than we can deliver today. And why can't we deliver more today? Because our current system can only find a limited number of users who will meet their revenue goals. As our technology improves, we will continue to find more users who achieve these goals, increasing advertiser spend, resulting in materially higher growth than the growth rate of the mobile gaming market. Last quarter, I talked about a goal of growing our software business 20% to 30% for the long term. I typically don't communicate externally about our goals if I don't have confidence in it. I'm communicating it now because I do have strong confidence in it and I see many years of growth ahead of us. Here are the primary drivers of that growth goal. Continued improvement from our models as they learn from more data. As our models gather more data, they'll become more accurate and find more good users for our advertisers, gains that our team delivers to the efficacy of our models through enhancements. Our research, science, and core engineering team members are exceptionally talented and consistently deliver lifts to the performance of our models. Demand expansion into new verticals, we just launched the first web advertising campaigns for shops this quarter. And while in pilot right now, we think it will unlock a lot of demand expansion opportunities for us. And then supply expansion, as we broaden out our demand base outside of gaming, we expect the new categories will really help grow our CTV footprint. We continue to be very excited about our prospects and the performance our team is able to deliver. We will work tirelessly to achieve the goals we set and hope that over the next many quarters and years together, you will have a better sense of how an AI driven marketing platform creates growth opportunities that just weren't possible in advertising before because technologies were not this sophisticated. With that, I'll hand it off to Matt to run you through the financial highlights. Yeah. Good to see, Jason. In the quarter, Q2, we launched pilot of our web advertising program and this allows -- let's talk about e-commerce first. This allows an e-commerce shop that has a website to buy on our in-app inventory, the billion-plus daily active users we see in mobile gaming, a video advertisement routes that user to their shop and purchase that user in the same way that mobile game companies like purchasing users on our platform. So, doing it on a performance basis and then we're delivering them measurable revenue and results. This is brand-new. I'd say it's been in pilot for a few months now. Results are looking really promising, materially better than what we would have expected this early in our progression in trying to get into web advertising. So this product, we think is something that we're going to invest heavily behind, start scaling out and hopefully will show a material impact in '25 and beyond. And it is not limited to just e-commerce. It opens the door to advertising for any website of any type that wants to drive transactions that are measurable on a performance basis on our platform. Thanks. Yeah. I mean, look, when we've talked about this growth goal, if you just think about the growth goal in terms of mobile gaming in the business that we have today, we just grew 5% quarter-over-quarter, the numbers are getting pretty big. Q1 was materially more. It was in the teens quarter-over-quarter. We've always talked about like the model is going to continue to improve itself and pick up a few points of growth every single quarter just from that enhancement. But then the team is also trying to apply enhancements on top. When we get lifts from the team, those can be step-function. Like, we saw in Q1, you wouldn't expect Q1 having double-digit growth over Q4. And so we're seeing really good trends in Q3. The business is still very strong. We've got a lot of momentum with our customers. They continue to see us as really the main channel now in mobile gaming advertising. And around and behind that, we're also now seeing exciting trends in what we just talked about, the web advertising category. So we've got a lot of optimism going into the next quarter. Yeah. We don't think it's very dependent outside of gaming at all. You've got a mobile gaming category. It's got a few percentage points of growth a year now. So let's call that low-single digits. You've got a business that as these models continue to improve from gathering more data, we think that's an extra 3%, 4% a quarter as well. So, that sort of gets you to the low end. And then we've got a team that's constantly working on improving the models and any improvement that's actually develop or driven enhancement to the models that makes them more accurate, then steps you up into the higher-end of that range. And so we've got a lot of confidence in the growth goal we put out there just on a baseline basis the current business. Now, we do the with current business now we do sit on 1 billion plus daily active users. We've got one of the most sophisticated advertising platforms in the world and we're driving billions of dollars of performance value in gaming. There's nothing about the technology we have that would disallow it from going outside of just mobile gaming, and we're already seeing positive trends in that pilot. So as we start putting these pieces together and broaden out our platform over time, we're really excited about how big the numbers could become. No. And we're not seeing any change in the aggregate, but you also have to remember our market is a little bit different. We're driven in large part by advertising based applications growing audience. So that 1 billion plus daily active users are inside of apps that run advertisements. You monetize those apps partially with games that generate purchases, partially with games that generate purchases and advertising. And so that number isn't documented anywhere, but we're seeing the overall IP market, everyone can look at industry reports and see it growing low-single digits. We're also seeing the advertising-supported market grow faster than that. Great. Omar. Yeah. So we don't provide long-term guidance. Obviously, we're only looking a quarter ahead. As Clark touched on, you can sort of deduce where that software business we're guiding to on the upcoming quarter. It's still -- if you start adding up the quarters to get into 20%, 30%, you want to see 5%, 6%, 7% quarter-over-quarter growth. We think we can be confidently in those ranges for quite some time, we see a lot of opportunity to grow. Now that removes any opportunity for step function gains and model enhancements driven by the team. That also does not include really any sort of thought given to what new categories are going to contribute to our business long-term because frankly, again, they're in pilot. So, we're not backing those numbers into longer-term views on the business. So we think we're going to be in a place where this business is going to be steady, it's going to be growing at a very nice rate and the conversion in cash flow is only going to improve and we've got a lot of other exciting things that are going on that give us confidence that we could even be above those ranges. Yeah. Also, look, that market already is growing much faster than the in-app purchasing market because it's just at a smaller base. We're also -- the MAX platform we've touched on in the past, the majority of the mobile gaming and app advertising market is running through that MAX auction. That MAX auction has gone from the inefficient world of waterfall to programmatic bidding. Vast, vast majority of the auction is now in a bidding state and so it's continuously gotten more efficient. Our advertising has also gotten a lot more efficient. So as you've seen our business doubling in the last year, there's billions of dollars of more investment happening for mobile gaming companies and user acquisition and user discovery. Some part of that is in-app advertising advertisers and that's helped be a catalyst to regrowing this industry as a whole in-app purchasing. But some portion of that also is are these publishers that are buying more users now because our systems are more effective for advertising based applications are so -- but all of this stuff is intertangled together and we're one of the main catalysts of growth in this category because our scale is so large inside this category on both fronts. Yeah. I mean, look, like at this level of scale with how big the software business is, if you backed out total advertiser dollars that you think are in our platform, it's in the many billions of dollars. So we've always worked with some of the very large publishers like we usually have had pretty deep penetration in mobile gaming, but there are some very well-known large publishers that did look at us as a competitor. At this point, our platform is so successful in mobile gaming, it's very, very hard for any publisher to look the other way. And so we've gotten a lot more adoption across even those publishers. There isn't really a customer that I know of in mobile gaming that does not find success -- scalable success on our platform at this point today. Like, we can't speak to other people's technologies or things that prohibit them from being able to get categories to work in gaming, but Trade Desk products are nothing like ours. When it comes to succeeding on behalf of advertisers, in any category, we want our models to be able to drive measurable revenue. So you got to have an attribution framework, you've got to have models that can predict revenue and match the user up with the advertiser and you've got to make it all work together. We're in pilot with this product right now. It's looking quite promising. And so we think it's something that we're going to be able to build on and build on very aggressively as we go forward. No, I think it's a combination of both. I mean, we process tens of billions of dollars of transactional volume already, and we see $1 billion-plus daily active. So our platform is not small at this point. And that data is able to be used across anything. These are human beings, not just mobile gamers and the audience skews female and middle-aged. And so it's completely different than what people would assume a gaming audience is at a very, very large scale, directly applicable to e-commerce is something that we've always hypothesized as possible. The models in AXON 2 are so much more sophisticated than in technologies we've had in the past that they should enable success there. Now we're in pilot and we're seeing success there. So we're at the point now where we know we put the pieces in place and now it's more of a go-to-market problem and less of a technology problem. Yeah, sure. Sure,. So the non-gaming continues to grow, but it's still a relatively small portion of the overall installations when you look at the overall software business. So to Adam's previous comments, like it's still a relatively small portion of the existing business and it's still kind of in pilot mode there. So we continue to see kind of promising results, but it's really not needing today. I mean, like we've said in the past about M&A and divesting the apps businesses, we continue to be open to it and we're really just waiting for the market to improve. And we've been optimizing the app studios over the last over a year. So, you can see that as well, right, in this quarter where we've adjusted the return goals for our UA spend, decreasing costs pretty materially and increasing our margin profile. So, we'll continue to maximize those businesses for-profit and we'll be open to transactions in the future. Yang you said 35% sequential quarter-over-quarter. So, there's two components, right, like one is the market growth, which we can all say is low-single digits. One is just models getting better every single quarter because they see more data and they get more accurate. And that's -- these models by definition, this is how they work. And so we see that in real-time, the models continue to get more accurate. Now our advertisers and I said this in my talk track, our advertisers will spend much more today on our platform that we can deliver to them. The limitation is how many users can the models match-up on across every single one of those advertisers at those revenue goals. If the models get better, they're able to process more data and find more users for those advertisers, so the spend will go up naturally. And it's not that these advertisers are adding more budget, it's not that they're saying, we want to buy users at a more expensive cost to them by definition, lowering their goals. It's that the models get better, all else stays equal and these advertisers grow on our platform. And so we're seeing that in real-time. And there is a very, very large appetite for incremental spend on our platform because we deliver profits to these advertisers. They're arbitrage marketing on us, they are buying at a profit. And so they will spend a lot more if our models can do it. And so those two things can build out a very good sustainable growth rate inside the mobile gaming category. And then the third piece is, if you end up having a lift to the form of technology that you're using, you materially enhance that technology. And in the past have used like ChatGPT 3.5 for these are incremental changes that are step functions in these types of technologies and I use that as an analogy because people understand it. But in our world, we're constantly making enhancements to the technology. When there is a lift to the technology, that could be a step-function in growth for the same reason because these advertisers will spend more and it can make our models more accurate at larger-scale on behalf of them. So hopefully that answers for you, Martin. Yeah. I mean, look, we're a very, very large-scale, right? So that data creates a moat. And the more data our models process, the better they're going to get. So every single quarter, we launch the system, we just went and lapped the one-year anniversary, right? So it's been in the market now for a year-plus. Every month has been bigger than the prior month. So we get more data, processes more data with those incremental data points, the math gets stronger, the model gets stronger and it can drive more value. And so we've seen that consistently. These AI technologies are very, very new. So it's not like in the world, we have 10 years of history to look-back on and go, when do these models stop improving themselves. They currently are doing that today. That's by nature, that's how this AI technology works, processes immense amounts of data and through that, the math gets stronger and more accurate and more predictive. And so we're seeing that in real time. That gives us confidence that this core underlying technology is going to continue to grow over time. Yeah. I mean, look, we're very, very accurate today. When an advertiser says, I want to break even in 30 days on our platform, we achieve that goal for them. When I say increasing the match rate, it means let's say that advertiser says, I want to spend $1,000 today and I want to get the $1,000 back in 30 days and we get that within a percent of inaccuracy. So they get whether it's $990 or $1,010 back in 30 days that we have a limit of $1,000 that they can spend today, though the system can only deliver that much with a very low error rate for them.

Well, they have unlimited tolerance to spend, if all else remains equal and as our technology continues to improve, that business will continue to grow."

            "name": "Matt Stumpf",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to report we had another strong quarter with total revenue reaching $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $601 million, achieving a 56% adjusted EBITDA margin. This marks a 44% increase in revenue and an 80% increase in adjusted EBITDA from the same-period last year, translating to an impressive 81% flow through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter, we generated $446 million in free cash flow, which is a 74% flow through from adjusted EBITDA. Quarter-over-quarter, our free cash flow grew 15% compared to 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA over the same period as we benefited from a relatively stable base of cash tax and interest. During the quarter, improvement in our AXON technology driven by ongoing self-learning contributed to further growth of our software platform, which generated $711 million in revenue and $520 million in adjusted EBITDA, retaining our 73% margin and growing 91% from the same period last year. This represents an 87% flow through of revenue from the prior quarter, illustrating our ability to remain disciplined with our costs, growing revenue while remaining lean and efficient. Our apps revenue for the quarter was $369 million, an increase of 7% from last year with $81 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 22% margin. During the quarter, we readjusted our user acquisition return goals, resulting in an 11% quarter-over-quarter decrease in total app segment costs, while revenue decreased by 3%. We expect our future margin profile to normalize to approximately 15% over the long term, consistent with industry standards. Looking ahead to capital allocation, we plan to focus on three key areas. First, investment in organic growth initiatives, specifically our engineering and business development headcount to support the development of our AXON technology and expansion into e-commerce. We do not expect significant capital investment here since we plan to expand our teams in a very lean and targeted manner. Second, continued share management activities with the combination of withhold to cover on future share vesting and strategic repurchases. And third, strengthening of our balance sheet to enhance operational flexibility and liquidity while reducing net debt. In Q2, we used $356 million to withhold 4.2 million shares, allocating about 80% of our free cash flow in the quarter to share management. Since 2022, we have invested nearly $3 billion to repurchase and withhold a combined 83.6 million shares. Finally, in the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate to deliver between $1.115 billion and $1.135 billion in revenue with adjusted EBITDA between $630 million and $650 million, targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 57%. Now with that, let's move to Q&A. Yeah. Sure, Clark. So our plan currently is to continue kind of the historical trend of continuing to manage our shares through withhold the cover on shares that are vesting each quarter. And then on a strategic basis, we'll continue to do supplemental repurchases in addition to the quarterly investing."

Now, I'll turn it over to Adam and Matt for some opening remarks, then we'll have the moderator take us through Q&A.\nAdam Foroughi: Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report another record quarter in Q1, continuing our pattern of delivering strong financial results. With AXON 2 turning one year old and achieving nearly a full recovery in our share price after a very difficult 2022, I wanted to reflect on some key themes that we've consistently stated and now actively proven out. We believe our culture is unique. By staying lean and retaining key contributors, we have built an exceptionally high performing team of subject matter experts capable of innovating faster and more effectively than those at other companies. We believe our business is not limited by the size of the mobile gaming market, but rather that our business can drive market growth. Advertisers have increased their spend on our platform as a result of the improved performance from AXON. And now, we're seeing the industry return to growth. We stated the operating leverage of our software platform business is as good as any technology company in the world. In one year, our quarterly software business revenue grew from $355 million to $678 million. Of this incremental $323 million of revenue, 84% or $273 million flowed through to adjusted EBITDA. Now, two more themes that are important to understand as our business goes forward. First, a key driver of our growth will be the ongoing improvements to AXON. Our models are still in an early stage and will continue to improve themselves, but more importantly, our teams are still finding ways to materially improve these algorithms. While these gains may not be predictable, they may sometimes lead to quarters like Q1 where we far exceed expectations. Second, there is nothing that limits our models to just gaming. By expanding into web based marketing and e-commerce, we expect our AI models to improve with added demand diversity. As we continue to execute on the previously discussed themes, we expect to see further growth in our business. While our early days in the public markets were volatile since we started this company 12 years ago, our business has consistently remained strong and we hope over time, all of our shareholders and prospective investors will gain the same confidence in our business and vision that we have always had. I can promise you that we've never been more excited about our prospects. With that, I'll hand it off to Matt to run you through the financial highlights.\nMatt Stumpf: Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. I'm happy to share we had another quarter of exceptional financial results, generating total revenue of $1.06 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $549 million, which is a 52% margin. Our revenue grew nearly 50% from the same period last year, while adjusted EBITDA has doubled. During the first quarter, we generated $388 million in free cash flow, that's an incredible 71% flow through from adjusted EBITDA. Our software platform also had another excellent quarter, with revenue of $678 million and adjusted EBITDA of $492 million, retaining our 73% margin and more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA from the same period last year. This represents a 71% flow through of revenue from the prior quarter. While we remain diligent about cost discipline, we did have a slight step function increase in our cloud data center costs at the end of Q4 to reserve GPU capacity to support future growth. We saw the full impact of the cost increase during this quarter and expect future flow through to improve. Our business was reinforced by strong market conditions, including expansion in the mobile advertising market and continued adoption of real-time bidding. Our software platform also benefited from technology improvements, including ongoing self-learning, additional data and enhancements by our engineering team. We continue to be optimistic about our ability to drive compounding efficiencies, leading to improved performance for our advertising partners. Our apps portfolio remained stable from last quarter, maintaining 15% adjusted EBITDA margin. Turning to our capital structure. During the quarter, we amended our term loans, capitalizing on favorable market conditions to further reduce interest expense, while at the same time amending our loans to include outstanding revolver borrowings previously used for share repurchases. Continuing our commitment to share management, in Q1, we repurchased and withheld a total of 14.9 million shares of our stock. Net of issuances during the quarter, we reduced our total shares outstanding by approximately 3%. Since we began our share management activities in early 2022, we have spent nearly $2.6 billion to repurchase and withhold a combined 79 million shares, that's a remarkable 20% pro forma reduction in our total shares outstanding. Turning to our second quarter guidance. We expect to deliver between $1.06 billion and $1.08 billion in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within the range of $550 million and $570 million, that represents an adjusted EBITDA margin between 52% and 53%. In conclusion, we continue to have confidence on our ability to drive growth from our core business, while we work to expand our long-term opportunities. Now with that, we'll move on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Matt, and now, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Clark, please go ahead.\nClark Lampen: Okay. Can you guys hear me, okay?\nAdam Foroughi: We hear you, Clark.\nClark Lampen: Perfect. Okay. Adam, I've got two on software and app discovery. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that this quarter results exceeded your internal expectations. Is there anything specific that you might call out for us amongst the sort of key sources of outperformance? And then I guess sort of second and bigger picture, as we think about the trajectory for software and app discovery after a couple of quarters of really strong sequential revenue growth, I think there's some concern percolating that once we anniversary the start of the AXON cycle that maybe growth starts to asymptote. Could you help us frame-up, I guess, current momentum and the runway that you see within both the core gaming market and new channels like e-commerce?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Thanks, Clark for the question. So on the first one, I touched on this in the script, but we've got a few growth vectors. One is going to be adding more advertisers both within gaming and then breaking out to these new verticals that we're working on and quite excited about. Secondarily and more importantly, anytime we see improvements in our core models, we see gains in our business and there's two forms of improvements. These models are self-learning. So, we've got them in the marketplace. We're serving a ton of impressions every single day and there's a feedback loop that gets this data back into the model and it improves itself. So, there's a component of that, that's why the system continues to get better since we launched it. And the second piece is, our team obviously is still working every single day. So, every time our research science team creates some sort of innovation or breakthrough on those models, that ends up a step-function gain in the business because if you think about these models, it's all math. And if the math gets more accurate, then we're going to see a gain in the business and these are very high margin gains because there's no costs associated with that gain. There's no sales process to go bank that gain, it's just a gain in the business. And so, I try to tie it back to the first quarter and performing really well against obviously the toughest quarter in advertising against Q4. This -- the gain we saw in the first quarter was predominantly due to just enhancements to the models themselves. And so, that's going to be one of our core drivers going forward. Now to the question of the software growth slow, look, software is growing about 90%, 100% year-over-year and it's a 73% margin business. So, we don't need it to grow double every single year. It's a net revenue reported business on the vast, vast majority of the revenue. So, every incremental dollar is very, very high margin. We'd love to be in the neighborhood of a 20%, 30% long-term grower for many years to come. In order to do that, how do we think about the business longer term, it's the same building blocks that we just talked about. We're going to get more advertisers in gaming that are buying on our platform because now at this point, our platform is the best channel for a mobile gaming customer to go buy advertising. Now, if we're the best in the world today at driving value to mobile gaming advertisers and there's nothing that limits our technology from working outside gaming, how good could we be in other verticals. So, the vertical expansion is a key part of our focus. And then beyond that, we're in the business of creating improvements to our technology. So, if you start adding all that up, how do we keep growing this business? There's a lot of levers that we have to pull to be really excited and that's why it ended with. We've never been more excited about the prospects we have in front of us than we are today.\nClark Lampen: Thank you.\nOperator: And Ralph Schackart with William Blair has the next question.\nRalph Schackart: Good afternoon, Adam. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, you've been fairly consistent in saying that AXON 2 engine, works outside sort of the gaming vertical and you sort of touched on that in your last response. Can you maybe give an update sort of where you are in that sort of effort, outside of gaming? Do you need new sales force? Are you testing any results you could share? Sort of want to get a sense as sort of where you are in that effort. Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Thanks, Ralph. Good to see you. And a couple of things. One is, we look at the advertising world with apps and websites, right? Like, there's two forms of media that people are buying to the end destination. And today in the app marketing world, we're very good at gaming. We also work with non-gaming apps, and we've seen success once we rolled out AXON 2 across a variety of non-gaming companies growing on our platform too. And I think last call, we touched on that that the non-gaming app space is growing faster than the gaming app space on our platform just because it starts from a lower base. That success hasn't changed. We still see the same trajectory. Now, what has us excited and what we've been working on is launching the first form of web advertising on our platform. And if you think about a lot of transactional industries, e-commerce in particular, most of the transactions are still done on the website, not the mobile application because a lot of shops don't even have a mobile application and so, that's been work we've been doing. We will be bringing that product to market this quarter, and it's something we're very, very excited about as a way to really build out a lot more demand density into our platform.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Thanks, Adam\nOperator: Moving on to Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: I'm afraid to ask this question because you guys are doing so well. But would you mind just giving us an update on your sales process? I remember several years ago, you sort of made fun of yourself because you didn't really have a sales force and didn't think about it. And I'm just trying to get a sense, you haven't talked about it as a vector, but is all of this growth we're seeing a function of sales and the technology or is it just purely the technology and it's sort of selling itself based on the return to customer?\nAdam Foroughi: So, like, since day one, I know that I'm not a very good seller and it was something that we really focus on being product first at the company. We believe if we build great products and we innovate well that if the advertisers are seeing success on our platform, they're going to tell their peers and their peers are going to come to our platform and this thing could self-sell itself. And we've seen that happen in mobile gaming as AXON 2 continues to perform well. A lot of the mobile gaming customers who either hadn't heard of us or had chosen not to work with us have adopted our platform over the last year. So, we haven't ramped up sales to go get those relationships. And a lot of those relationships are still in an earlier stage than some of the companies that have been on our platform for years. So, that will contribute to growth in the gaming vertical over time. When we look at outside of gaming, we're still -- we have no interest in getting into brand advertising. So, everything is performance based. We fundamentally want to play -- replay the same playbook where we're not going to invest heavily in sales now, and some of these transactional categories outside gaming, you do need some presence, some marketing, some sales, but it's not going to be a heavy investment. And we do believe that if we're able to go drive the same result where, for instance, in e-commerce, the shops seek a lot of benefit from marketing on our platform and they can measure the result and they see a stronger result on our platform as some of the other channels they buy on, there's going to be a lot of interest because these other transactionally charged categories desperately need more marketing available to them as those industries are struggling to grow themselves.\nOperator: Thanks, Jason. Omar Dessouky has the next question. And just to let you both know he's on audio only, so you won't see him.\nOmar Dessouky: Hey, thanks. I had a couple of questions about header bidding, aka real-time bidding. I guess those are the same term. What is the quarterly revenue run-rate trajectory for the rest of this year, for that? I think you guys said that you collect a 5% fee on header bidding into MAX supply. I was wondering where that stood and how that's going to move going forward?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So Omar, we don't disclose that level of detail, the revenue for specifically the MAX business or for header bidding. But we have continued to see that trend that we've been talking about historically, the trend of people shifting over to header bidding with an acceleration in Q1. So, we're continuing to see that positive trend.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. It's been -- I've heard that Unity will be bidding into AppLovin and MAX Supply and I was wondering, if you could maybe describe the strategic implications or importance of that to you, right, because they're viewed as a competitor. Is there any new data that you'll be getting about your primary competitor as a result of this and why does it take so long for this to happen?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So, a bunch of questions embedded in there. But for one, let's just start with the market. The vast, vast majority of the market bids today, 80% plus. So, the transition that was a multi-year effort to get market to go from traditional ad-tech in mobile app to go to real-time format is nearly complete at this point. Two, MAX is by far the largest mediation solution in mobile gaming. We've touched on this in the past and it continues to be a very strong platform. So, as a marketplace, third parties want to buy on our platform in a real-time format. It's just more efficient. And when any company ends up buying on our platform, they're an advertising solution that's competitive with us. And so, I wouldn't call any one company a primary competitor, we're all friendly competitors. And we've also talked about what drives this market in particular that's quite unique to other markets is there's no zero-sum in this ecosystem. If the whole market is buying efficiently and the publishers are making more, the publishers reinvest more in the user acquisition, the pie grows and all of us advertising companies are hopefully benefiting from that. The last point to make, and I think there's a misunderstanding in the marketplace on this, we don't have some sort of data advantage with any of the companies that are buying into our platform. We're very secure about data. Our partners can audit us when it comes to our data practices. The data that we have available to us is the same data that any bidder on our platform gets available to them. And so therefore, there isn't some data advantage from Unity or anyone else buying on our platform. It's a completely fair, transparent and clean auction and it provides a huge benefit to the publisher. And for us, it's been a very good product that we have in market and is continuing to do well.\nOmar Dessouky: Do you have time for one -- just one quick one. I didn't see net revenue for install growth -- or install growth on your letter. Could you update us on that and give us any kind of the puts and takes around that?\nMatt Stumpf: Yeah. So, the numbers will be disclosed within our 10-Q, Omar, so you can see all the actual figures there, but similar to prior quarters, we've had an increase in both the net revenue per install as well as the volume of installations and that's through the continued improvement of AXON that we've been talking about. As the technology continues to improve, we should see both the growth in the amount of money that we're making per installation and volume of install as we see more advertisers increasing their spend.\nOmar Dessouky: Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\nTim Nollen: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to pull a few strings together from what we've been hearing already. And I'd like to ask about going beyond mobile gaming base of advertising. You answered the question about having access to, sales force and accessing other verticals. And you've spoken in the last couple of quarters about expanding your Wurl business into bringing some more demand into CTV. So, can I sort of combine these into a question to ask, why does that need to be focused on performance based advertisers and not brand advertisers? I mean, I understand the difference, but if you've got an expanded advertising base, more verticals moving into connected TV, I'm just wondering, if you could update us on what you're doing with Wurl and why you couldn't become more of a competitor in that CTV ad-buying space?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. So, Wurl to us is just added eyeballs. It's added supply CTV channel versus the mobile app ecosystem we touched on, we have over 1 billion daily actives in the mobile app ecosystem. We've got a lot of access to eyeballs, but 5 hours a day of TV watching is inaccessible if we don't get to an SSP that sits in connected TV. So, that was the idea with Wurl is bring a lot of supply online. Now, it's our job to go monetize it. We've never wavered from being focused on performance advertising at the company in a couple of reasons. One, again, I didn't want to build out a sales force. And if you're selling someone to buy a brand-advertised spent dollar, you have to really convince them that that dollar is well spent. There's no data that backs it up. The attribution is murky at best. And so, you have to have a salesperson that convinces the other side that dollar spent was well spent. Our model is the advertisers spent a dollar and everything is measurable, it's all closed-loop, it's real-time reported and they know if they spend a dollar and they made more than a dollar, they're buying as an arbitrage marketer and there's not a whole lot of selling to do in the middle there. If you have someone spend a dollar and earn two, they will spend that dollar as many times a day as you will spend it on their behalf. And so, all of our algorithms, our entire system is predicated on that concept. And what's powerful about that concept is, when we can create lifts in our business, as you've seen over the last year and I touched on the incredible flow-through of this business that we've consistently set as a theme in our business model. We don't have to go convince advertisers to spend more. They will automatically spend more. So, our constraint is just how many dollars can our systems accurately on their behalf place in the universe. To create growth, the systems have to improve, which we've shown can drive a lot of growth and we have to go access more eyeballs. And that's the goal around the world. We do think in connected TV advertising, as we get into e-commerce and prove an efficient model for shops to advertise on our platform, that will extend very naturally to the e-commerce yet to the CTV landscape because the shopping ad could be very beneficial for consumers in that media.\nTim Nollen: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. Any comments on Wurl's growth or contribution to revenues or anything you can share?\nAdam Foroughi: It's still too small to break out, so we don't talk about it, but they've done a great job of bringing a lot of supply online. So, now the other side is the opportunities bringing the demand on\nTim Nollen: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you very much. Maybe following up on Tim's question, but asking a little bit different way, Adam, when you think about entering new verticals or new canvases, we've seen you taken a number of different approaches, purchasing companies, taking stakes in companies, partnerships. How should we be thinking about the capital allocation dynamics around thinking through organic versus inorganic growth? And where the -- how to sort of maximize for ROI when you think about how far reaching the platform can become as you look at some of these canvases over the medium to longer term? And then second question would just be incremental margins. Obviously, you guys continue to produce very high incremental margins after the investment cycle you had been through in the prior 12, 18 months. Just continued thoughts on guideposts around incremental margins as the business continues to sustain relatively high levels of growth. Thanks so much, guys.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. I'll start with the first and Matt can answer the second. Thanks, Eric. That really, when we think about our business, we built a very, very compelling implementation of AI, one of the most powerful systems the world has ever seen in this space. And so organically, we have a huge advantage to continue to build on that and how do we build on that? It will come from a few different things, get more partnerships, get more data and get more reach. And so, all of that in terms of like the way we think about it and getting more reach is accessing eyeballs. Well, we have a carrier OEM business now, we have a CTV business and we have our core business and there's over 1 billion daily active users just on the core business. So, we access a lot of eyeballs already. So, the reach is sort of there, sitting there for us to go capitalize on. Demand diversity is we fundamentally believe is an organic problem. The algorithms are going to be able to execute on any transactional vertical. And so, we just have to get this product rolled out. The R&D effort was building the system to be able to do web marketing for the first time. This is that's just not something a company named AppLovin really thought about over the last 12 years. And so, now as we go forward, we've got that technology, we're going to be able to execute in that space. And so, that again is an organically charged effort. And the hardest part of all of this was building the algorithms, building that that the AI models are incredibly complex. And a lot of companies obviously in the world today and technology, almost every company will talk about the AI strategy, but very, very few have been able to actually execute on a large scale implementation of complex systems like these. So, having that at our disposal really keeps us excited about this organic path we've got going forward.\nMatt Stumpf: And just in terms of expectations around margins, Eric, I mean, we expect the margins to continue to expand to the extent that we see increased development for AXON, right, as Adam has talked about in the past, the improvements to the actual technology because we're already reporting net revenue essentially dropped to the bottom line. So, what you're seeing is as margins grow through that development is that it should continue to expand. Obviously, as volumes growing, then margins should stay relatively flat. So, at this point, we wouldn't expect any decrease from our existing level of partner.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you.\nOperator: Jefferies, James Heaney has the next question.\nEd Alter: Hey, guys. This is Ed Alter on for James Heaney. Thanks for the question. From piggybacking on some of the earlier questions from some of our checks, we're seeing that the bigger the app developer is, the more they actually are kind of spending share of AppDiscovery. So, like besides obviously AXON, what are you seeing that is winning those incremental dollars versus others, and where are the bounds of that?\nAdam Foroughi: I mean, in our system, we don't really have a limit to what an advertiser spends. Most all of our partners don't set any sort of budgetary limitation. So, the bigger advertisers obviously by definition have a better base business. They've got probably in mobile gaming, a more successful games, so they're a bigger company, then therefore, they can spend more dollars per day. But the really nice thing about our system today is somehow someone on our research science team tomorrow had a breakthrough and our models got twice as effective, the business would double overnight because there isn't a budgetary constraint. So, we think like at this point, our job in mobile gaming to deliver value to the advertiser has been effectively accomplished. And now, a lot of the growth is going to come from new advertisers, both in gaming that we don't work with 100% penetration of the market or even close to that. So, gaming customers around the world now are hearing about this platform that a year ago didn't exist and now is outperforming every other platform in the world. And so, that as we continue to see organic adoption of our platform in the gaming category, we will see growth from these new advertisers, which some are large, some are small, but all adds up. And then secondarily, again, this expansion outside the mobile gaming business is something we're really excited about.\nEd Alter: Yeah. Great. Maybe just to follow up on your view of the where we sit in the mobile gaming market in general, after a couple of years of down, most -- some are expecting growth this year, is that what you guys see as well, and what's driving that?\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah, totally. We said it on the talk track, but our platform is really large. If you think about a net revenue reported advertising network, which is the vast majority of our software business, for us to have doubled the software business in the last year, there's billions of incremental dollars that were spent in the mobile gaming category on our platform. That didn't hold from other channels. So, companies in mobile gaming don't go. Today, I can spend $0.10 extra over here. Therefore, I'm going to take $0.10 from this other channel and move it over. They'll just say, I can spend $0.10 more in my goal, therefore, I'm going to spend more on my goal and that's it. And so, it takes a while for that to compound and be reflected in the $100 billion TAM that everyone looks at because these -- the paybacks on the user acquisition tend to be somewhere between three months to 12 months. So, if you build-out like, okay, well, what happened? Well, AppLovin doubled in a year, their business. So, billions of more dollars were spent on an industry that spends tens of billions of dollars of user acquisition. So, there is certainly material amount of growth in the dollars invested because of the AXON breakthrough, then you'll start seeing the TAM start expanding once that starts paying off, users are paying back into those cohorts into the games that they downloaded, the cohorts start stacking and the whole category will expand. And so, a lot of the TAM expansion you're starting to see reflected by single-digit growth, which is what a lot of that is attributed directly back to the success our technology is having driving growth to these advertisers.\nEd Alter: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks.\nOperator: Moving on to Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball.\nVasily Karasyov: Good afternoon. I have a question about your competitive dynamic. Obviously, your results are so good. AXON 2 is working so well. Do you see any competitors ramping up to go after your business and put up a fight against you? And if so, how do you feel about it and obviously, the returns are too good, right, to pass up? Do you see any changes in the competitive situation at this point? And how are you preparing for that? Thank you.\nAdam Foroughi: Yeah. Thanks, Vasily. We've been asked about competition for years and we always say we don't necessarily pay attention to the competition because look, there's some -- people look at the technology that we have and in the industry that we do and they view it in an oversimplified manner and think one company builds some sort of algorithm and everyone else can just copy and everyone's going to catch up. These systems are really, really complicated. We built cutting-edge AI technologies. It's a multi-year effort for anyone to be able to look at that and go be able to replicate that. And I don't even think it's conceivable that it's something that can be replicated. So, by the time there's anyone that's actually going to be able to compete against our technology, we will be years advanced from where we are today because we're continuing to evolve the technology. Second piece is, we can open-source our code tomorrow. We can hand-out the code to competition. It still won't matter because these technologies need data that they're achieving in the marketplace to be able to drive themselves. So, if you think about like AI models, like what makes an AI model impactful? Well, they're utilized and that data feedback that they get from human behavior retrains the model and allows the model to continue to improve itself. ChatGPT being a perfect example of an AI model that's super compelling. Every search that every word that we all type into it gets a result and that result in the efficiency of that result and the way the user engages with that result retrains that model if you give it a thumbs up, thumbs down. In our model, we're getting an insane amount of data into the system every single day. System is continuing to improve itself. So, we sort of look at the world now and say, we've got cutting-edge technologies. We're in a leadership position in a category that's pretty large, this isn't the largest and certainly isn't very fast-growing, but we've got an opportunity to really go out and expand our business and go deliver value to companies all over the world well outside of mobile gaming and allow them to unlock value for their business through our use of AI. And that's something that we're very excited about and we think is going to continue to allow us to distance ourselves from other players in our ecosystem.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Martin Yang with OpCo.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. In your shareholder letter, you highlighted that underlying advertising market have grown year-over-year. And can you maybe comment on, what's from your view, how much have that market grow in 1Q and you have the number, how much has the market grow in 4Q?\nAdam Foroughi: You're asking how much of the market grow from quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year?\nMartin Yang: If you have both year-over-year numbers for 1Q and 4Q, respectively.\nAdam Foroughi: It's very hard for us to understand the whole ad market. And it's also like I'm not sure the whole ad market has ever been fairly defined. Is it the global advertising spend? Is it the global advertising spend in mobile apps? Like, what we look at when we talk about growth are the two areas that drive our business. One, IAP category, so we talk about mobile gaming as a vertical a lot. When we talk about the advertising market, in large part, we're talking about the MAX marketplace that's growing quite a lot, double-digit plus year-over-year, but we don't disclose what the annual year-over-year growth is of the actual MAX marketplace.\nMartin Yang: Got it. So is it right to you -- so you -- are you assuming MAX marketplace is a good proxy for the world market?\nAdam Foroughi: For mobile gaming, advertising, yes, given our leadership position in the category and what we've talked about percentage of market share of the MAX product that we think it's so diversified at this point that it is a very good proxy for the growth in advertising-based mobile gaming businesses.\nMartin Yang: Got it. My next question is on your net revenue per install and volume both install. This quarter, it's 5% and 87% respectively. The net revenue per install change on a year-over-year basis is very different from preceding quarters. How should we interpret those two numbers and the changes? Is there any -- a relationship between the two that tell us, underlying changes in the market?\nMatt Stumpf: Yeah. So, I think we've talked about this in the past, Martin, that when you see a very large increase in the volume of installations as we were talking about in this quarter that -- that's correlated to an increase in advertiser spend. So, as a result, year-over-year, right, comparing to Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024, we saw the AXON on launch during that period. And so, as a result of that, we saw advertisers increase their spend pretty dramatically over the last four quarters.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's webinar. We thank you all for your participation and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care until then.\nAdam Foroughi: Thanks everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Foroughi",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report another record quarter in Q1, continuing our pattern of delivering strong financial results. With AXON 2 turning one year old and achieving nearly a full recovery in our share price after a very difficult 2022, I wanted to reflect on some key themes that we've consistently stated and now actively proven out. We believe our culture is unique. By staying lean and retaining key contributors, we have built an exceptionally high performing team of subject matter experts capable of innovating faster and more effectively than those at other companies. We believe our business is not limited by the size of the mobile gaming market, but rather that our business can drive market growth. Advertisers have increased their spend on our platform as a result of the improved performance from AXON. And now, we're seeing the industry return to growth. We stated the operating leverage of our software platform business is as good as any technology company in the world. In one year, our quarterly software business revenue grew from $355 million to $678 million. Of this incremental $323 million of revenue, 84% or $273 million flowed through to adjusted EBITDA. Now, two more themes that are important to understand as our business goes forward. First, a key driver of our growth will be the ongoing improvements to AXON. Our models are still in an early stage and will continue to improve themselves, but more importantly, our teams are still finding ways to materially improve these algorithms. While these gains may not be predictable, they may sometimes lead to quarters like Q1 where we far exceed expectations. Second, there is nothing that limits our models to just gaming. By expanding into web based marketing and e-commerce, we expect our AI models to improve with added demand diversity. As we continue to execute on the previously discussed themes, we expect to see further growth in our business. While our early days in the public markets were volatile since we started this company 12 years ago, our business has consistently remained strong and we hope over time, all of our shareholders and prospective investors will gain the same confidence in our business and vision that we have always had. I can promise you that we've never been more excited about our prospects. With that, I'll hand it off to Matt to run you through the financial highlights. We hear you, Clark. Yeah. Thanks, Clark for the question. So on the first one, I touched on this in the script, but we've got a few growth vectors. One is going to be adding more advertisers both within gaming and then breaking out to these new verticals that we're working on and quite excited about. Secondarily and more importantly, anytime we see improvements in our core models, we see gains in our business and there's two forms of improvements. These models are self-learning. So, we've got them in the marketplace. We're serving a ton of impressions every single day and there's a feedback loop that gets this data back into the model and it improves itself. So, there's a component of that, that's why the system continues to get better since we launched it. And the second piece is, our team obviously is still working every single day. So, every time our research science team creates some sort of innovation or breakthrough on those models, that ends up a step-function gain in the business because if you think about these models, it's all math. And if the math gets more accurate, then we're going to see a gain in the business and these are very high margin gains because there's no costs associated with that gain. There's no sales process to go bank that gain, it's just a gain in the business. And so, I try to tie it back to the first quarter and performing really well against obviously the toughest quarter in advertising against Q4. This -- the gain we saw in the first quarter was predominantly due to just enhancements to the models themselves. And so, that's going to be one of our core drivers going forward. Now to the question of the software growth slow, look, software is growing about 90%, 100% year-over-year and it's a 73% margin business. So, we don't need it to grow double every single year. It's a net revenue reported business on the vast, vast majority of the revenue. So, every incremental dollar is very, very high margin. We'd love to be in the neighborhood of a 20%, 30% long-term grower for many years to come. In order to do that, how do we think about the business longer term, it's the same building blocks that we just talked about. We're going to get more advertisers in gaming that are buying on our platform because now at this point, our platform is the best channel for a mobile gaming customer to go buy advertising. Now, if we're the best in the world today at driving value to mobile gaming advertisers and there's nothing that limits our technology from working outside gaming, how good could we be in other verticals. So, the vertical expansion is a key part of our focus. And then beyond that, we're in the business of creating improvements to our technology. So, if you start adding all that up, how do we keep growing this business? There's a lot of levers that we have to pull to be really excited and that's why it ended with. We've never been more excited about the prospects we have in front of us than we are today. Yeah. Thanks, Ralph. Good to see you. And a couple of things. One is, we look at the advertising world with apps and websites, right? Like, there's two forms of media that people are buying to the end destination. And today in the app marketing world, we're very good at gaming. We also work with non-gaming apps, and we've seen success once we rolled out AXON 2 across a variety of non-gaming companies growing on our platform too. And I think last call, we touched on that that the non-gaming app space is growing faster than the gaming app space on our platform just because it starts from a lower base. That success hasn't changed. We still see the same trajectory. Now, what has us excited and what we've been working on is launching the first form of web advertising on our platform. And if you think about a lot of transactional industries, e-commerce in particular, most of the transactions are still done on the website, not the mobile application because a lot of shops don't even have a mobile application and so, that's been work we've been doing. We will be bringing that product to market this quarter, and it's something we're very, very excited about as a way to really build out a lot more demand density into our platform. So, like, since day one, I know that I'm not a very good seller and it was something that we really focus on being product first at the company. We believe if we build great products and we innovate well that if the advertisers are seeing success on our platform, they're going to tell their peers and their peers are going to come to our platform and this thing could self-sell itself. And we've seen that happen in mobile gaming as AXON 2 continues to perform well. A lot of the mobile gaming customers who either hadn't heard of us or had chosen not to work with us have adopted our platform over the last year. So, we haven't ramped up sales to go get those relationships. And a lot of those relationships are still in an earlier stage than some of the companies that have been on our platform for years. So, that will contribute to growth in the gaming vertical over time. When we look at outside of gaming, we're still -- we have no interest in getting into brand advertising. So, everything is performance based. We fundamentally want to play -- replay the same playbook where we're not going to invest heavily in sales now, and some of these transactional categories outside gaming, you do need some presence, some marketing, some sales, but it's not going to be a heavy investment. And we do believe that if we're able to go drive the same result where, for instance, in e-commerce, the shops seek a lot of benefit from marketing on our platform and they can measure the result and they see a stronger result on our platform as some of the other channels they buy on, there's going to be a lot of interest because these other transactionally charged categories desperately need more marketing available to them as those industries are struggling to grow themselves. Yeah. So Omar, we don't disclose that level of detail, the revenue for specifically the MAX business or for header bidding. But we have continued to see that trend that we've been talking about historically, the trend of people shifting over to header bidding with an acceleration in Q1. So, we're continuing to see that positive trend. Yeah. So, a bunch of questions embedded in there. But for one, let's just start with the market. The vast, vast majority of the market bids today, 80% plus. So, the transition that was a multi-year effort to get market to go from traditional ad-tech in mobile app to go to real-time format is nearly complete at this point. Two, MAX is by far the largest mediation solution in mobile gaming. We've touched on this in the past and it continues to be a very strong platform. So, as a marketplace, third parties want to buy on our platform in a real-time format. It's just more efficient. And when any company ends up buying on our platform, they're an advertising solution that's competitive with us. And so, I wouldn't call any one company a primary competitor, we're all friendly competitors. And we've also talked about what drives this market in particular that's quite unique to other markets is there's no zero-sum in this ecosystem. If the whole market is buying efficiently and the publishers are making more, the publishers reinvest more in the user acquisition, the pie grows and all of us advertising companies are hopefully benefiting from that. The last point to make, and I think there's a misunderstanding in the marketplace on this, we don't have some sort of data advantage with any of the companies that are buying into our platform. We're very secure about data. Our partners can audit us when it comes to our data practices. The data that we have available to us is the same data that any bidder on our platform gets available to them. And so therefore, there isn't some data advantage from Unity or anyone else buying on our platform. It's a completely fair, transparent and clean auction and it provides a huge benefit to the publisher. And for us, it's been a very good product that we have in market and is continuing to do well. Yeah. So, Wurl to us is just added eyeballs. It's added supply CTV channel versus the mobile app ecosystem we touched on, we have over 1 billion daily actives in the mobile app ecosystem. We've got a lot of access to eyeballs, but 5 hours a day of TV watching is inaccessible if we don't get to an SSP that sits in connected TV. So, that was the idea with Wurl is bring a lot of supply online. Now, it's our job to go monetize it. We've never wavered from being focused on performance advertising at the company in a couple of reasons. One, again, I didn't want to build out a sales force. And if you're selling someone to buy a brand-advertised spent dollar, you have to really convince them that that dollar is well spent. There's no data that backs it up. The attribution is murky at best. And so, you have to have a salesperson that convinces the other side that dollar spent was well spent. Our model is the advertisers spent a dollar and everything is measurable, it's all closed-loop, it's real-time reported and they know if they spend a dollar and they made more than a dollar, they're buying as an arbitrage marketer and there's not a whole lot of selling to do in the middle there. If you have someone spend a dollar and earn two, they will spend that dollar as many times a day as you will spend it on their behalf. And so, all of our algorithms, our entire system is predicated on that concept. And what's powerful about that concept is, when we can create lifts in our business, as you've seen over the last year and I touched on the incredible flow-through of this business that we've consistently set as a theme in our business model. We don't have to go convince advertisers to spend more. They will automatically spend more. So, our constraint is just how many dollars can our systems accurately on their behalf place in the universe. To create growth, the systems have to improve, which we've shown can drive a lot of growth and we have to go access more eyeballs. And that's the goal around the world. We do think in connected TV advertising, as we get into e-commerce and prove an efficient model for shops to advertise on our platform, that will extend very naturally to the e-commerce yet to the CTV landscape because the shopping ad could be very beneficial for consumers in that media. It's still too small to break out, so we don't talk about it, but they've done a great job of bringing a lot of supply online. So, now the other side is the opportunities bringing the demand on Yeah. I'll start with the first and Matt can answer the second. Thanks, Eric. That really, when we think about our business, we built a very, very compelling implementation of AI, one of the most powerful systems the world has ever seen in this space. And so organically, we have a huge advantage to continue to build on that and how do we build on that? It will come from a few different things, get more partnerships, get more data and get more reach. And so, all of that in terms of like the way we think about it and getting more reach is accessing eyeballs. Well, we have a carrier OEM business now, we have a CTV business and we have our core business and there's over 1 billion daily active users just on the core business. So, we access a lot of eyeballs already. So, the reach is sort of there, sitting there for us to go capitalize on. Demand diversity is we fundamentally believe is an organic problem. The algorithms are going to be able to execute on any transactional vertical. And so, we just have to get this product rolled out. The R&D effort was building the system to be able to do web marketing for the first time. This is that's just not something a company named AppLovin really thought about over the last 12 years. And so, now as we go forward, we've got that technology, we're going to be able to execute in that space. And so, that again is an organically charged effort. And the hardest part of all of this was building the algorithms, building that that the AI models are incredibly complex. And a lot of companies obviously in the world today and technology, almost every company will talk about the AI strategy, but very, very few have been able to actually execute on a large scale implementation of complex systems like these. So, having that at our disposal really keeps us excited about this organic path we've got going forward. I mean, in our system, we don't really have a limit to what an advertiser spends. Most all of our partners don't set any sort of budgetary limitation. So, the bigger advertisers obviously by definition have a better base business. They've got probably in mobile gaming, a more successful games, so they're a bigger company, then therefore, they can spend more dollars per day. But the really nice thing about our system today is somehow someone on our research science team tomorrow had a breakthrough and our models got twice as effective, the business would double overnight because there isn't a budgetary constraint. So, we think like at this point, our job in mobile gaming to deliver value to the advertiser has been effectively accomplished. And now, a lot of the growth is going to come from new advertisers, both in gaming that we don't work with 100% penetration of the market or even close to that. So, gaming customers around the world now are hearing about this platform that a year ago didn't exist and now is outperforming every other platform in the world. And so, that as we continue to see organic adoption of our platform in the gaming category, we will see growth from these new advertisers, which some are large, some are small, but all adds up. And then secondarily, again, this expansion outside the mobile gaming business is something we're really excited about. Yeah, totally. We said it on the talk track, but our platform is really large. If you think about a net revenue reported advertising network, which is the vast majority of our software business, for us to have doubled the software business in the last year, there's billions of incremental dollars that were spent in the mobile gaming category on our platform. That didn't hold from other channels. So, companies in mobile gaming don't go. Today, I can spend $0.10 extra over here. Therefore, I'm going to take $0.10 from this other channel and move it over. They'll just say, I can spend $0.10 more in my goal, therefore, I'm going to spend more on my goal and that's it. And so, it takes a while for that to compound and be reflected in the $100 billion TAM that everyone looks at because these -- the paybacks on the user acquisition tend to be somewhere between three months to 12 months. So, if you build-out like, okay, well, what happened? Well, AppLovin doubled in a year, their business. So, billions of more dollars were spent on an industry that spends tens of billions of dollars of user acquisition. So, there is certainly material amount of growth in the dollars invested because of the AXON breakthrough, then you'll start seeing the TAM start expanding once that starts paying off, users are paying back into those cohorts into the games that they downloaded, the cohorts start stacking and the whole category will expand. And so, a lot of the TAM expansion you're starting to see reflected by single-digit growth, which is what a lot of that is attributed directly back to the success our technology is having driving growth to these advertisers. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Vasily. We've been asked about competition for years and we always say we don't necessarily pay attention to the competition because look, there's some -- people look at the technology that we have and in the industry that we do and they view it in an oversimplified manner and think one company builds some sort of algorithm and everyone else can just copy and everyone's going to catch up. These systems are really, really complicated. We built cutting-edge AI technologies. It's a multi-year effort for anyone to be able to look at that and go be able to replicate that. And I don't even think it's conceivable that it's something that can be replicated. So, by the time there's anyone that's actually going to be able to compete against our technology, we will be years advanced from where we are today because we're continuing to evolve the technology. Second piece is, we can open-source our code tomorrow. We can hand-out the code to competition. It still won't matter because these technologies need data that they're achieving in the marketplace to be able to drive themselves. So, if you think about like AI models, like what makes an AI model impactful? Well, they're utilized and that data feedback that they get from human behavior retrains the model and allows the model to continue to improve itself. ChatGPT being a perfect example of an AI model that's super compelling. Every search that every word that we all type into it gets a result and that result in the efficiency of that result and the way the user engages with that result retrains that model if you give it a thumbs up, thumbs down. In our model, we're getting an insane amount of data into the system every single day. System is continuing to improve itself. So, we sort of look at the world now and say, we've got cutting-edge technologies. We're in a leadership position in a category that's pretty large, this isn't the largest and certainly isn't very fast-growing, but we've got an opportunity to really go out and expand our business and go deliver value to companies all over the world well outside of mobile gaming and allow them to unlock value for their business through our use of AI. And that's something that we're very excited about and we think is going to continue to allow us to distance ourselves from other players in our ecosystem. You're asking how much of the market grow from quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year? It's very hard for us to understand the whole ad market. And it's also like I'm not sure the whole ad market has ever been fairly defined. Is it the global advertising spend? Is it the global advertising spend in mobile apps? Like, what we look at when we talk about growth are the two areas that drive our business. One, IAP category, so we talk about mobile gaming as a vertical a lot. When we talk about the advertising market, in large part, we're talking about the MAX marketplace that's growing quite a lot, double-digit plus year-over-year, but we don't disclose what the annual year-over-year growth is of the actual MAX marketplace. For mobile gaming, advertising, yes, given our leadership position in the category and what we've talked about percentage of market share of the MAX product that we think it's so diversified at this point that it is a very good proxy for the growth in advertising-based mobile gaming businesses. Thanks everyone."

            "name": "Matt Stumpf",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon. I'm happy to share we had another quarter of exceptional financial results, generating total revenue of $1.06 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $549 million, which is a 52% margin. Our revenue grew nearly 50% from the same period last year, while adjusted EBITDA has doubled. During the first quarter, we generated $388 million in free cash flow, that's an incredible 71% flow through from adjusted EBITDA. Our software platform also had another excellent quarter, with revenue of $678 million and adjusted EBITDA of $492 million, retaining our 73% margin and more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA from the same period last year. This represents a 71% flow through of revenue from the prior quarter. While we remain diligent about cost discipline, we did have a slight step function increase in our cloud data center costs at the end of Q4 to reserve GPU capacity to support future growth. We saw the full impact of the cost increase during this quarter and expect future flow through to improve. Our business was reinforced by strong market conditions, including expansion in the mobile advertising market and continued adoption of real-time bidding. Our software platform also benefited from technology improvements, including ongoing self-learning, additional data and enhancements by our engineering team. We continue to be optimistic about our ability to drive compounding efficiencies, leading to improved performance for our advertising partners. Our apps portfolio remained stable from last quarter, maintaining 15% adjusted EBITDA margin. Turning to our capital structure. During the quarter, we amended our term loans, capitalizing on favorable market conditions to further reduce interest expense, while at the same time amending our loans to include outstanding revolver borrowings previously used for share repurchases. Continuing our commitment to share management, in Q1, we repurchased and withheld a total of 14.9 million shares of our stock. Net of issuances during the quarter, we reduced our total shares outstanding by approximately 3%. Since we began our share management activities in early 2022, we have spent nearly $2.6 billion to repurchase and withhold a combined 79 million shares, that's a remarkable 20% pro forma reduction in our total shares outstanding. Turning to our second quarter guidance. We expect to deliver between $1.06 billion and $1.08 billion in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within the range of $550 million and $570 million, that represents an adjusted EBITDA margin between 52% and 53%. In conclusion, we continue to have confidence on our ability to drive growth from our core business, while we work to expand our long-term opportunities. Now with that, we'll move on to Q&A. Yeah. So, the numbers will be disclosed within our 10-Q, Omar, so you can see all the actual figures there, but similar to prior quarters, we've had an increase in both the net revenue per install as well as the volume of installations and that's through the continued improvement of AXON that we've been talking about. As the technology continues to improve, we should see both the growth in the amount of money that we're making per installation and volume of install as we see more advertisers increasing their spend. And just in terms of expectations around margins, Eric, I mean, we expect the margins to continue to expand to the extent that we see increased development for AXON, right, as Adam has talked about in the past, the improvements to the actual technology because we're already reporting net revenue essentially dropped to the bottom line. So, what you're seeing is as margins grow through that development is that it should continue to expand. Obviously, as volumes growing, then margins should stay relatively flat. So, at this point, we wouldn't expect any decrease from our existing level of partner. Yeah. So, I think we've talked about this in the past, Martin, that when you see a very large increase in the volume of installations as we were talking about in this quarter that -- that's correlated to an increase in advertiser spend. So, as a result, year-over-year, right, comparing to Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024, we saw the AXON on launch during that period. And so, as a result of that, we saw advertisers increase their spend pretty dramatically over the last four quarters."
