Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 25, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Michael Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please, go ahead. \nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. On the line is Steve Chapman, our CEO; Bob Schueren, Chief Operating Officer; Solomon Moshkevich, General Manager of Oncology; and Paul Billings Chief Medical Officer. Today we also have our Co-Founder and Chairman, Matt Rabinowitz, on to review the results of the SMART trial. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be available@investor.natera.com. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our operational and financial outlook, our assumptions for that outlook, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, market sizes, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various current and future products, including product capabilities, expected release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that, such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter, unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes, as we discuss our financial performance and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let's get into the highlights. Q4 2020 was the best quarter we've ever had at Natera. We processed 295,000 tests, up 13% sequentially versus a very strong Q3 2020 and up 41% over Q4 2019. Revenues were $112 million, our first quarter above $100 million and product revenues were up 43% versus Q4 of last year. This represents the fastest quarterly net unit growth in company history. I'll get into more details on what's driving our performance in a moment. On top of 2020 being a great year for Natera, we enter 2021 with significant momentum across all of our businesses. In women's health, we've seen an acceleration in commercial payer coverage in average risk NIPT, even since we last spoke in November. As of January, all of the major national plans are covering NIPT for all women and we've seen significant adoption among state Medicaid plans. We also released the results of the SMART trial at the SMFM Conference in late January and we announced the validation of our new Panorama artificial intelligence platform. The final results from this trial were even stronger than expected and put us in an excellent position to achieve reimbursement for our microdeletions test and further drive market share gains within the NIPT space. Our growth is being further amplified by the progress we are making in the transplant business. We've collaborated with top KOLs to present data at each of the major academic conferences this winter. We've continued to produce data on Prospera's unique differentiators, including the ability to detect background cell-free DNA simultaneously from the same workflow, with no extra turnaround time or added cost. We believe this differentiator will be valuable for physicians. For example, the high level of background cell-free DNA we are seeing in patients affected by COVID-19 can mask rejection and we've completed a study highlighting our ability to assess when this might be occurring. All of these data sets are being submitted for publication. And I will spend more time on that when it comes out later this year. Overall, we continue to hit our internal volume growth targets for Prospera. And we're very pleased with how the transplant business is developing. In oncology, on the pharma side of the business, we announced in January that deals signed in 2020 exceeded $65 million up from $9 million two years ago. That business got a boost in December when Genentech's IMvigor study was presented. This was the first time an MRD assay has been evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial and the results for Signatera were compelling. On the clinical side of the business, our colorectal cancer launch is underway and we've now completed the build-out of our commercial team. This investment gives us a great jump-start as we seek to capitalize on our first-mover advantage. Now that the commercial team is in place, we can start executing on our plan to expand the Signatera indications and add other new products to their bag. I'm excited today to announce two oncology launches, Signatera I/O monitoring and Altera tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling which allows physicians to select targeted therapies for cancer patients. Altera can be ordered from the same tissue sample used to power Signatera, but will also be available as a stand-alone offering. There are significant synergies between the two tests, particularly in advanced-stage indications, where the use of a therapy selection panel is commonplace and reimbursed and the need for improved monitoring of patients for sponsored immunotherapy is clear. Altera fits right into the bag of the clinical field force we have in place for Signatera. And we think this combined offering will be compelling for oncologists. Solomon will get into more detail on that later in the call. Mike is going to get into details on the revised guide at the end of the call, but there are two major headlines. The first is that, we're guiding total revenues at $500 million to $525 million. And second, we expect the reproductive health business to get to a sustainable cash flow breakeven during 2021. Having our core women's health franchise cash flow breakeven, allows us to continue making substantial investments to maintain our leadership position in oncology for the long-term. This guide presumes, we keep the volume growth going across all three areas of the business, and that's exactly what we've seen so far this year in 2021. Going above the $500 million mark in revenues, and getting to cash flow breakeven in women's health are two major milestones that have been years in the making. And we're excited how to have these goals in sight. Okay. With that, let's get into some of the business trends. The next slide is our volume progression over time. Q4 represents a big step-up, even compared to our very strong Q3 performance. This breaks from historical trends where both. Q3 and Q4 have traditionally been more muted, providing a nice momentum into 2021. The volume growth we experienced in the second half of the year was driven by strong account retention and new business wins during the height of COVID-19, last spring and early summer. The mix in our women's health business between average risk and high-risk hasn't changed that much. We believe two potential future drivers of growth average-risk NIPT market penetration and a bump from the SMART trial are likely still in front of us. The next slide demonstrates that revenue growth is tracking nicely with volume growth, once again accelerating meaningfully over what we've seen in the past. If you just zero in on product revenues on the right-hand side, you'll see revenue growth rates of 43%. This removes development revenue from partners which was larger in 2019 than it is now. We saw recurring ASPs step-up again in Q4 versus prior periods and blended COGS remain in the low 200 range. The combination of consistent gross profit per test and volume growth that we talked about in the past is working as expected, allowing us to get the women's health business to cash flow breakeven, supporting even bigger investments in the oncology business. The payor response to the ACOG practice bullet has been stronger and faster than we anticipated last fall. We were really pleased to see all the major payors start covering NIPT in all women, and continue to see excellent progress among state Medicaid plans. This is positive not only for coverage but also for market penetration. As health plans expand coverage, many providers are changing their protocols from serum to NIPT. Given those trends, the timing of our SMART trial data readout is very timely. We are very pleased to be joined on the call today by Matt Rabinowitz, our Board Chairman and Natera's, Co-Founder, who helped initiate and steer this trial for several years. Matt?\nMatt Rabinowitz: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. I decided to join the call today to highlight the significance of the team's achievement on the SMART trial, which was over five years in the making. The trial was designed to affirm the performance of our NIPT technology in the general population and in the detection of microdeletions. We have made some big predictions at Natera. These include that NIPT would be adopted and reimbursed in all risk categories and that our personalized oncology assay Signatera would achieve differentiated performance and reimbursement across multiple cancer indications. These have now occurred as we predicted because solid science usually prevails. Based on the exceptional performance of our technology in the SMART trial and the prevalence of microdeletions in the study, we now believe that professional guidelines can change and that microdeletions testing in NIPT will be more broadly reimbursed. SMART was an over 20,000-patient prospective clinical trial with 21 global centers. We collected pregnancy clinical outcomes as well as genetic truth samples from the fetus or the born children for 18,497 cases. This unprecedented data was used to showcase unique capabilities of Panorama, including Panorama AI. The AI or Artificial Intelligence component uses deep learning neural networks to model the sequencing data better than could be achieved by our team of classical statisticians. This amazing science was enabled by more than 1.6 million samples that we could use for training the deep learning network and the performance can continue to evolve with more samples. This is like a modern biotech equivalent of the competition between Kasparov and the supercomputer over the game of chess, which the supercomputer ultimately had to win. Panorama AI extends our leadership in women's health. Two major presentations came out of the trial and each are now being submitted for publication. First, SMART serves as the largest ever prospective aneuploidy NIPT trial and the only study of this scale to collect genetic outcomes at birth, setting a new bar in quality and science. The majority of the patients in the study were average-risk and we demonstrated best-in-class performance with 99% sensitivity and 99.97% specificity in Trisomy 21 with a positive predictive value in the general population of 95.1%. As a large number of newly adopting providers start using an NIPT, we think this study confers a significant advantage and further separates us from NIPTs that have limited or no peer-reviewed data. Panorama AI lowered the no call rate to roughly 1.5% while maintaining best-in-class accuracy. This category of cases that have very low fetal fraction were also clinically significant as these cases were at substantially increased risk for other conditions including preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. These add to the list of unique clinical differentiators, which have made Panorama the leading test. Second, SMART serves as a major advancement for microdeletion testing, rigorously validating Panorama's best-in-class performance and advanced and clinical knowledge of the most common microdeletions 22Q11.2. We showed excellent performance in detecting 22Q, as we expected detecting a 100% of cases of the most common microdeletion, 2.6 megabases or greater. Using Panorama AI, we were able to also detect the smaller microdeletions below 2.6 megabases, down to 0.7 megabases, which amounted to 41% of the disease load, significantly more than previously believed. Including microdeletions of all sizes in the 22Q region, we demonstrated a sensitivity of 83% and a positive predictive value of 53%. This performance is unique in the industry. Today, none of the mass parallel shotgun sequencing labs are testing for the smaller microdeletions, which is a critical issue given how common they are. This could prove to be a major competitive advantage for Natera. Clinically, 22Q microdeletions proved to be much more common than previously believed, but consistent with our estimates based on commercial experience. At an incidence of one in 1,525 this disorder is more common than cystic fibrosis at one in 4,000 or spinal muscular atrophy at one in 10,000 each of which are in the guidelines for screening and broadly reimbursed. In women under the age of 35 the incidence of this disorder neared that of Trisomy 21. Crucially none of these 22Q cases were detected at the first trimester ultrasound and only roughly half were detected by any other means throughout the pregnancy. We can't be prescriptive yet on timing but we think that the study should be sufficient to drive changes to society guidelines. We received a dedicated reimbursement code for microdeletions testing which is priced by CMS at $759 and we already run more than 400,000 of these tests annually which grew 37% year-on-year from 2019 to 2020. The next step is to get these data sets accepted for publication in high-impact journals. Back to you Steve. \nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Matt. Panorama is the market-leading NIPT. We performed over two million tests to date. We're uniquely leveraging the power of SNPs to deliver best-in-class performance and differentiated clinical value and the SMART trial further amplifies those differences. We studied more than 1.3 million patients in 23 peer-reviewed publications. With the completion of the SMART trials we now have the largest, most rigorous and the highest-quality validation data for both aneuploidy and microdeletion testing. Combined that with our seasoned clinical and commercial teams and we're very well positioned for the increase in NIPT adoption over the next several years. We believe the average risk NIPT market could get close to 75% to 90% penetration over the next three to five years which bodes well for our business, especially with the high and consistent attachment rates of both carrier screening and microdeletion testing to NIPT which further amplify the benefit of the expanding NIPT market penetration. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Solomon Moshkevich to cover some of the recent highlights in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. The first slide here is on the addressable markets in liquid biopsy that we've shown before. Natera is the leader in MRD and monitoring and we are aggressively investing to maximize our first-mover advantage. We have hired up the commercial oncology team and we're well underway with our launch in colorectal cancer which is going very well. As Steve announced earlier, we're now launching Signatera for immunotherapy monitoring as well on the strength of both our peer-reviewed data in Nature Cancer published last year and our draft coverage decision from Medicare which we expect to be finalized later in this year. We're now also leveraging our leadership position in monitoring and MRD to expand into adjacent markets. We're excited today to announce the launch of Altera tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling or CGP for therapy selection. Therapy selection we believe is a $6 billion market opportunity with established reimbursement which makes a lot of sense for Natera given the growing strength of our customer relationships in oncology. Altera also pairs nicely with our launch of Signatera in immunotherapy monitoring which we'll go into more in a moment. Let's first dive into how Altera works. Altera reports genomic alterations found in the cancer across the full exome with extra boosted coverage in over 400 clinically relevant oncogenes. Altera is at the cutting-edge of therapy selection tests with its exome-wide coverage of nearly 20,000 genes, its full transcriptome-based RNA-seq analysis for optimal detection of structural rearrangements its matched normal DNA analysis to filter out germline mutation that can sometimes cause false positives and other tests and its ability to identify MSI status and gold standard TMB status based on the exome. Altera will be offered as a stand-alone test and also in conjunction with Signatera for those who want to combine therapy selection with personalized monitoring. A big advantage here is that Signatera is a tumor-informed test where whole exome sequencing is already performed on the tissue and normal DNA specimens from all Signatera patients to inform the personalized assay design. So now we can deliver the Altera CGP results seamlessly from the same specimens. This is a key advantage for advanced-stage patients where both CGP and treatment monitoring are both clinically indicated and where tissue can often be scarce. Now let me share a typical patient journey that includes both Altera and Signatera for a patient receiving immunotherapy. As we've discussed before over 200,000 patients per year are treated with immunotherapy, but an even higher number of patients are screened annually for immunotherapy eligibility. This eligibility assessment often depends on biomarker status including what alterations are found in the patient's tumor. For example the FDA has approved a pan-cancer indication for the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-high tumors or tumors with high Tumor Mutational Burden or TMB. We think that using our Altera test would be an efficient way for a treating physician to assess immunotherapy eligibility or eligibility for other targeted therapies and then use the pretreatment blood sample as the baseline for future treatment response monitoring with Signatera with no additional tissue specimen required. Both Altera and Signatera would be covered by Medicare in this scenario. So in our clinical business, we're now full steam ahead with early-stage colorectal cancer where we are enrolling nicely into the BESPOKE registry trial as commercial adoption of Signatera gains broader momentum. And now we're launching IO monitoring and Altera. We look forward to releasing more updates on the clinical market as time goes on. Now shifting gears to the pharma business. You see the rapid progression we've had these last two years since launch. This business has continued to mature as we have predicted and we're now seeing significant interest in larger Phase III studies which if successful can lead to having Signatera included in the drug's label as a companion diagnostic. Pharma is now using Signatera in studies of more than a dozen different cancer types. A key driver of this business is the compelling data that we've been able to generate from some of the clinical trials. The muscle-invasive bladder cancer data presented just a couple of months ago by Genentech at ESMO IO is an excellent case study. This was the IMVIGOR one trial which was a global Phase III randomized and controlled trial of atezolizumab. It took more than five years to run at great expense. Unfortunately the trial itself failed to meet its primary endpoint in all cumbers after cystectomy. But atezo improved overall survival by 41% for the Signatera-positive patients, which was 37% of the population. So with 581 patients analyzed, IMVIGOR 010 is by far the largest study evaluating any MRD assay. And it's the first ever randomized controlled Phase III trial presenting results stratified by MRD status. Critically the study shows how Signatera can take a trial that did not work in all-comers and make the results positive by getting the drug to the right patients who are MRD-positive. As you can imagine we've fielded a lot of interest after the results of this study. Going forward we expect most adjuvant trials to include some level of MRD-related stratification. And in addition we also are seeing the impact of this predictive data on how physicians in the clinical market are perceiving the utility of Signatera even in early-stage colorectal cancer and in other indications. So to summarize, in oncology we have a lot of activity underway to drive the business: clinical launch of Signatera and CRC now in IO monitoring; launch of Altera CGP to drive additional insights for our ordering physicians; and continuing to ramp in our pharma business. Beyond that this slide gives a good snapshot of the data that we've already published to date and our pipeline that we'll be reporting out over time. As you can see we have a significant head start in published data across a range of cancer types and that leadership creates its own momentum and network effect. The leading biopharma companies academic medical centers and community oncologists all have a strong incentive to use the most thoroughly validated technology for their patients and in their clinical trials which could in turn enable us to accelerate our lead in generating more data which eventually leads to more coverage and adoption in new clinical indications. It's a virtuous cycle. As Mike will cover in a second this demands a significant investment on our part. But the rationale for our patients and our business is very clear.  Now let me hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? \nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The slide here is just a summary set of results for the quarter. Steve covered the major trends on volumes and revenues at the top of the call. You can see on the first two rows of the chart that the revenue growth was driven by robust product revenue growth and accounting-driven revenue recognition around signing the BGI and foundation medicine deals in 2019 was actually a headwind for the year-on-year revenue growth comparison. That's a very healthy dynamic and exactly what we had hoped to see. Within the reproductive health business, we continue to see a stable mix between Panorama and Horizon carrier screening and microdeletions testing was ordered as part of the Panorama NIPT about 75% of the time, which is consistent with what we've seen for the last five years or more. COGS per unit in the women's health business continued to improve. We are now below $200 per unit in that category and we saw improving trends in the NIPT average selling price. On NIPT ASP, we started to benefit from average-risk NIPT coverage policies, but the full benefit I think will gradually translate to revenue over several quarters as we get more history with changing payor coverage policies. To be clear, we started getting paid right away when coverage changes, but the visible impact on the P&L is really driven by the history required for accounting accruals on revenue. So the unit economics for our reproductive health tests continue to improve. Overall gross margins were slightly softer owing to driving some volumes in our new businesses prior to getting fully reimbursed. That's also a fairly transient impact as I'll discuss on the guide. On the expenses side, we were able to significantly accelerate our build of the infrastructure for commercialization in oncology. Accelerating this build-out is crucial to making sure we can win on every dimension not just technology and published out of leadership, but also in the experience we provide for the physician and the patient. It's much the same story in R&D. There's really two categories of R&D efforts we have going. One is a very targeted effort on true research. These teams are doing things like leveraging the data we are collecting from early-stage cancer exomes to develop new tests that can expand our addressable market. We've always committed a minority of our R&D team to this kind of work and the results include the technology behind Panorama AI and the Signatera and Prospera franchises. The second much larger effort is focused on development work that requires time and effort from a lot of really high-quality people, but the technical risk is relatively low and the returns are very clear. If you could sit in our reviews of these projects you would want us to fund all of them. One of the large projects in this category is our aggressive effort partnering with academia to generate validation data in a growing set of oncology indications. These types of projects have obviously paid off for us in the past and we are happy to have more sample banks and studies to run in this area. We built a strong cash position last year and we've been able to use it to our competitive advantage. For example in return for more favorable terms from partners and vendors and long-term deals, we made prepayments of roughly $15 million in Q4. Other than those prepayments our cash burn last year actually came in below our previous guide. Okay. Let's get to the next slide and the guidance for the year 2021. Steve gave you the headline at the top of the call. We expect revenues to be $500 million to $525 million, gross margins in the 47% to 52% range and we are expecting our cash burn to be $230 million to $250 million this year distributed across SG&A and R&D as you can see on the page. Let's walk through each of the key assumptions for each of these lines. First, the revenue line presumes that we will continue to see strong volume growth across all three business areas. In reproductive health, we've historically focused on the absolute unit volume growth per sales rep given that team is more mature. So the guide presumes we can produce a similar unit growth pace as last year which of course will require very good execution given the year we just had. The guide does not presume we get a huge windfall of units in a short period of time from the average-risk NIPT market opening up since the specific timing and speed of broader NIPT adoption are not under our direct control. Similarly we've tried to take a balanced approach in modeling the volume trajectory in transplant and oncology recognizing that we now have big teams in large markets for these areas. But these are also basically new categories and we have less forecasting history with them. We've taken a conservative tack on average selling price assumptions for the year's guide. That's mainly, a philosophical point in that, we just don't think it's wise for diagnostics businesses to just assume ASPs are going to improve, because the factors that can move against you are also largely behind your control. But if the very recent trends, we've seen so far in Q1 hold up our blended ASP assumption could end up being slightly conservative for the year. The gross margin assumptions have several crosscurrents running this year. We feel great about the reproductive health gross margin trajectory because \u2013 both because of the improving NIPT coverage, but also because cost of goods sold per unit continues to decline. For example, we've got a better Illumina supply agreement and the Pano AI platform is cutting down on our redraw rates once again. We are also pleased with the cost per unit trends we are seeing in oncology and transplant, which should be no surprise since both franchises are based on our core technology. The pressure on gross margins is as much more transient in linked to volume growth as I mentioned. For example, we are excited about launching in the IO monitoring indication and hope to grow units quickly, but don't expect a final reimbursement decision from CMS until the second half of the year. I covered the major drivers of SG&A and R&D increases in my review of the Q4 results. I expect those lines to grow in Q1 and Q2, and basically stay flat in the second half of the year based on the objectives we have mapped out for 2021 at this point. I do think there's one more variable that gets obscured on the page. We have found that investing in SG&A and R&D is much more effective and capital-efficient than doing lots of acquisitions. Many of the players in our space pay full price for targets to stay relevant and what we've done instead is, we've built our team. We'll try to be opportunistic on the M&A front, but I think you'll see us selectively picking up technologies for relatively small dollars and that's because the organic growth engine here is really strong. We talked in the past about the gross profit per test, and the unit volume metrics we would need to get to cash flow breakeven in the reproductive health business. Even with some additional investment targeting new product features and commercial activities, to support the growth we've seen, we feel confident we can cross over the cash flow breakeven line in reproductive health this year as Steve mentioned at the top of the call. That's a huge milestone for us, and should give some confidence that the investments we are making are primarily focused on these large markets in transplant and especially in oncology. So to summarize, we are very excited about 2021. We are off to a great start so far in Q1 and we think we've got a bunch of interesting catalysts to unlock as the year progresses. So with that, let me hand it back to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time here, and congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to ask an overarching question on the guide here. I know Mike you mentioned that, you've been relatively conservative in your assumptions for Signatera and Prospera. I'm assuming it's \u2013 Altera is probably not in there at this stage at all. Can you sort of like put a finer point on it in terms of giving us some color around volume trends particularly in the back half for each of those tests?\nSteve Chapman: Mike, you want to take them?\nMichael Brophy: Yeah. So thanks for the question. I think you hit on something there in your question, which was just the weighting for the year. I would expect the year to be somewhat back-end weighted as we kind of grow into these launches. In terms of specific stages, I think like in the future, we will start to give you kind of more color on volume trends broadly in those new areas. But not yet, I mean, we're basically starting from launches in Signatera effectively in Q4, and then middle of the year last year is when we got going in transplant. So we started to see some green shoots there and some contribution to revenue in Q4. And we're just going to expect that to kind of grow consistent with our comps, so far this year. \nTejas Savant: Got it. Fair enough. And Matt, it's good to hear for you again. Following the SMART study readout and the validation of the algorithm here, can you just share some color on early feedback you've had since the SMART study? I know, it's very recent, but I'm especially interested in the ability to detect patients at increased risk of pre-term birth in pre-eclampsia. Are those sort of standalone indication something that you could look to essentially add to the reproductive portfolio here? And on microdels, over what time frame do you think you start generating meaningful pay traction following the readout?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. This is Steve. Thanks Tejas. I'll take those. So, on the payer side, we think the most important thing is society guidelines. And we're at a position now generating this really gold standard evidence, the largest -- frankly the largest NIPT prospective trial that's ever been done but now doing that for microdeletions to have the type of data that societies will react favorably to. And so, once the papers published this summer, we expect to hear from the societies. And if you look at some of the press releases where the PIs on the study have been quoted, they've spoken very favorably about the opportunity here to change society guidelines. If that occurs, the payers will absolutely change their guidelines. So we look forward to the paper coming out followed by updated society guidelines and then payer policy following suit. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, last year we did 400,000 microdeletion tests and that was at a growth rate of 37% year-on-year versus 2019. So this is really a rocket-ship that's growing. We're running the tests. If we can get reimbursement, it's going to be -- we're going to be off to the races. When you look at, the first question, pre-eclampsia pre-term birth, we made a decision a long time ago to not report out results at extremely low fetal fraction, because we thought that there's something biologically going on there that is important for the physicians to not get tripped by and to not just get a negative NIPT result when there might be something more going on there. And now, it turns out that not only is fetal fraction and important as a quality control metric in getting an accurate annuality or microdeletion result, but patients that have low fetal fraction actually are at risk for pre-term birth, fetal demise, pre-eclampsia, at very significant levels. So we look forward to seeing, again, how physicians and the KOL community want to digest this information. With the Panorama AI algorithm, we were seeing percentages -- risk percentages of a 15%, 16%, 17%, risk to the pregnancy. And that's very significant compared to other biomarkers that are out there. So it's unlikely that will be a standalone test. But it's important when you're getting a no callback that you can get this extra information that no other laboratory can provide.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's super helpful, Steve. And one final one on Prospera for me. I feel like that's a part of the pipeline that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as oncology. The market is sort of still relatively at low levels of penetration. Over what timeframe, do you think you have a shot at sort of pulling even with sort of your competition there? And have you thought about sort of creating an ecosystem of service offerings around Prospera? Your competitors launched a referral service and a weightless management service and a software like EMR platform, et cetera. Is that as very much on your radar as well as you think about ramping Prospera volumes here?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So, we did spend a lot of time today talking about organ health, but that's an area where we continue to invest. And we're actually doing really well in 2020. I think we mentioned at the JPMorgan Conference that we actually beat our pre-COVID estimates for Prospera. So, we're pleased with the performance of the test. We're pleased with the interactions we've had with key opinion leaders. And certainly, we keep our eyes on some of these ancillary opportunities. You have to sort of decipher whether it fits in with the broader strategy at Natera -- these ancillary services whether they fit in with the broader strategy of Natera and whether they fit in with the strategy of interacting with patients and physicians. And if it does then we're certainly going to take a look. But we're keeping our finger on the pulse and it's an area that we think has an enormous opportunity to grow in the future.\nTejas Savant: Got it. Thanks so much and congrats again.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. A couple on Signatera IO and Altera, given the time line for the final LCD that you laid out, I guess is the initial use case for Signatera IO for RUO for pharma until you have the final LCD? And then, pricing you previously talked about $1,800 to $3,500. I'm just curious, if there's any updated thoughts? And then how are you thinking about pricing for Altera?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. So on the Signatera IO side, the test is CLIA validated. We have a peer-reviewed publication that came out in Nature Genetics last summer that serves as a validation study. So it's on the market now through our sales force in the CLIA environment clinical offering. So it's available to pharma as well as a CLIA test, but it is being sold through the commercial clinical sales force at this point. Now we're getting out there pre-reimbursement and we expect reimbursement to come in at some point this summer. And as you build the ramp when you initially launch something in the earlier days, the volume coming in and the ramp is less significant. So we think we'll be hitting our stride right around the time that that reimbursement comes in. The great thing about the Altera launch is that it's the same tissue sample and it's going to be very convenient for physicians to be able to order Altera, get the information back on therapy selection and tumor mutational burden MSI status, and then the ongoing monitoring and surveillance with personalized Signatera. Now the reimbursement for Altera is already established, so we can piggyback on the broad reimbursement that's already in place there. And that's one of the reasons why we thought it made sense to launch this and to add it to the bag.\nTycho Peterson: And then how often do you expect Signatera IO and Altera to be used together? Do you think that becomes the norm?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. I mean, if you look at the opportunity and the percentage of patients that are eligible for IO monitoring and then how that decision is made on who's eligible for IO treatment, it does seem like the vast majority of the time someone is setting up for potential Signatera that they're going to want Altera.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then as we think about your work with Foundation on developing liquid exome, how do you think about that in the context of these launches? I mean, is that something that potentially could replace Altera over time, or no?\nSteve Chapman: No. We think about the Foundation partnership as separate. I mean, Foundation medicine is really the leader in tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling. And the product that we're working on with them is going to be a therapy monitoring product that is based on their FoundationOne CDx product, which is a targeted panel comprehensive genomic profile. So they have a large team in place. They have a big customer base. And whenever somebody orders that FoundationOne CDx, they'll be eligible to design personalized primers. So we think about our exome-based Altera and Signatera as an independent offering. And together we're going to approach this market.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then a follow-up on the microdel commentary, I just want to be sure I heard that right. Do you think the guidelines could actually change as soon as this summer? I mean, we're all a little bit jaded from the average situation. And why do you think you're more bullish on microdels than some of your peers who have talked it down?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. So I mean look the societies respond to peer-reviewed data and this is the study that is going to change -- move the needle. If you look at the studies that move the needle for noninvasive prenatal testing in high risk or even in average risk, they were significantly smaller than this and less rigorous than this study. So a study of this magnitude with this level of clinical outcome has never been done before. So if you were to go back and design the perfect study that the societies would respond positively to this is it. And at the outset when we met with the key opinion leaders and society members and we said, what do you need to see in order to change society guidelines? They said two things, a disease incidence that is in line with expectations. And at that time it was thought that 22Q had a prevalence of about one in 2,000. In the study, we showed that it was about one at 1,500. So it's actually more common than what was thought. And the second thing was, we have to show a high sensitivity and a high positive predictive value. And we've done both of those. So the sensitivity in the microdeletions of above 2.6 megabases was 100%. And for all microdeletions -- all 22q microdeletions it was 83%. And the positive predictive value was 53%. So if you think about aneuploidy screening overall, serum screening has a positive predicted value of 5%. And so NIPT and aneuploidy has a higher PPV 80% to 90% for trisomy 21 and lower for the other aneuploidy trisomy 18 and 13. So this performance is right in there now with the top common aneuploidies. So we feel very positive about it. It's a severe genetic disorder that has a significant outcome on live births. There's a screening test that works very, very well. The gold standard study has been done. And the results came out very positively. So it's exactly what you would need in order to change guidelines. Now, of course, we can't promise anything, but this is exactly what you would want. It's a perfect setup for a guideline change. And if guidelines do change the payers certainly will change. And we're looking forward to the publication coming out at some point this summer.\nTycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. And then just last one quickly on guidance. On the guidance side for R&D, you highlighted expansion into new oncology indications. Is that anything you can kind of shed some more color on? Is that other indications beyond CRC? Is it pan-cancer MRD? Is it liquid exome? What's kind of the priority of this?\nSteve Chapman : Yes. So we're looking at multiple different things. That includes rapidly expanding Signatera indications. So while we work on commercializing colorectal and IO monitoring, we're looking at a long list of additional indications. We think eventually Signatera will be a pan-cancer assay and we're working on generating the data and multiple different indications as we've shown in the slide deck. But we're also looking at other ways that we can penetrate to the $50 billion liquid biopsy market. We talked today about tissue-based therapy selection. But we think that there's a lot more that Natera can do to leverage the strength of our technology across the entire $50 billion TAM. And you can certainly believe we have irons in the fire in each of those circles that we've shown in the slide deck.\nTycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. \nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon guys, and thank you for taking my questions. First, I guess, just a trend and kind of math question. Doing this on the fly, but it looks like you guys were doing about 22,000 tests per week in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering how that trended over the course of the quarter from beginning to end. And then keeping in mind you were doing -- using the same logic 17,000 to 19,000 tests per week over the first three quarters of the year, how much of the lift relative to the beginning of the year versus what we saw in Q4 was a function of average risk or new products versus seasonality? And then, I guess, a final component of this, presumably, you're expecting to trend up from here as we look ahead to Q1 and beyond?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Doug. I apologize actually my phone broke up for the first half of the quarter. \nMichael Brophy: I got it. Steve, I'll take it.\nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. So I think the core of the question is like how much of the uplift in Q4 is due to average risk versus just the business coming along and our typical kind of seasonality here. And look if you look back over the year what we saw was that in retrospect and spring in the summer what really drove the volume outperformance for the year was just organic kind of new account wins paired with even better than normal account retention. The mix between average risk and high risk NIPT didn't really change all that much through the course of the year. I mean, I think, historically that makes us like 60% average risk and 40% high risk. And that's ticked up maybe that's like 63-37 something in that Doug. So that not just positive, but that's sort of a rough and ready metric to tell you that it's not like -- I don't think that a lot of the average risk penetration is what's really driving us yet. I think that's largely in the future for us. So what led to Q4? I think there's -- typically, there's some step-up in Q4 versus Q3, but not like what we've seen here. And I think the second or third chart in the deck just shows you visually the size of the step-up in this Q4 versus the typical step-up that we've seen in years past. So I think that is a lot of kind of good account wins and just on organic growth. And we'll be able to tell with the benefit of hindsight to what extent it was some more kind of average-risk penetration. But anecdotally, it seems like that average-risk penetration is still ahead of us.  In terms of the volume like for next year, I mean I just kind of encapsulated in the revenue guide. So it does presume a strong volume growth next year tempered with the other areas of conservatism that we talked about in the prepared remarks. \nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Just a couple of clarifications, Mike. And thank you for all that. So there's nothing in there. I think Signatera would be in that number in terms of kind of Q3 to Q4 where you had another quarter of marketing. You're starting to get paid. That wasn't a big mover to the sequential improvement. \nMichael Brophy: Yes. So that is a contributor. And because it didn't exist really as much in Q3 because it's our growth, I think that is a contributor. But really I mean, if you look at the sequential growth in the women's health business are really across the product lines. I mean there's not like -- it's not a huge disparity where the new products are growing and the existing products are flat. The products are flat. On the contrary, I mean we saw very strong uplift across the business. \nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Super helpful. And then Steve, I'm going to ask a similar question to what I've asked other companies in this sub-segment over the course of earnings. So sorry, for folks listening, but we're going to go there again. You and your peers seem to be stating in the same place when it comes to cancer menu, which is something we've envisioned for a while. It just seems to be happening at a quicker pace than maybe we thought was going to happen. With you guys your moving to MRD monitoring was a pretty natural and smart extension given your leadership in high sensitivity cell-free DNA assay development.  That said you're now moving into tissue where you don't have a ton of experience at least in terms of using tissue for actual diagnostic purposes. And you would seem to need assays in screening and blood-based therapy selection to kind of round things out. So with that in mind my questions are, one. How do you build it -- how did you build out the tissue capabilities?  Two, how are you expanding your commercial infrastructure pursuant to the full menu build-out? And is that the right way to think about it? And then third, how do you think about building out the menu? Mike, at the end of his prepared remarks talked about increased investment in R&D and SG&A. But when I think of some of these things particularly screening that's an example of where you might be better served going inorganic. I just want to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Doug. So I think first, we've been doing a lot of hiring in R&D and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we put out. And we have a really solid team in place. So we've been working on different things. Yes. I think we're excited about the Altera launch. We think this is the first step into the $6 billion therapy selection opportunity.  We do think that looking at liquid therapy selection and asymptomatic screening makes place, but -- makes sense. But I think we're going to make smart decisions and be very targeted with our efforts. We do have some unique advantages. For example, we can -- we're doing a lot of early-stage exomes at this stage and that gives us information that others don't have access to that we can leverage to design assays that can perform well in an asymptomatic environment. So we're doing things in a very targeted manner on asymptomatic screening, but it is something that we're looking at. And I think as that program develops, we'll release more information.  On the tissue side and on the liquid therapy selection side, these techniques are the same techniques that we use for other assays. And we have very skilled team members and I think we're in a great position to put good tests out on the market. And yes, we'll be very competitive. What we're trying to do is leverage the commercial footprint that we've put in place and offer a full menu back to physicians.  So the oncology team that we built is top-quality, high-quality medical staff, sales staff, MSL staff. And when they're meeting with a physician, especially where there's significant amount of synergies, like there are with IO monitoring and Altera, it makes a lot of sense to capitalize on these different opportunities.\nDoug Schenkel: Thank you.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Steve, can I add a comment there? \nSteve Chapman: Yes. Sure, Solomon. \nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. There's obviously a lot of opportunity here, Doug, you pointed out. And from my perspective, our first priority is to maintain and extend our leadership position in MRD, which has opened up so much opportunity to improve patients' lives. A huge amount of demand, just inbound coming in from the data and utility we've been able to generate. And if you think about -- there's some serious platform opportunity, when you think about two things. First, to run a Signatera test, you automatically get the tissue sample, a normal DNA sample and plethora [ph] samples, right? So there's just so much you can do with those specimens. And then, the second thing is, once you generated a personalized assay for a patient and you're running monitoring for a long period of time, that's our patient for a long time. And that's a very special type of long-term relationship that's less common historically in this industry. And we intend to make the most out of that, to deliver the most services and insights we can for those patients. And those two things together is also going to help us generate our clinical genomic data strategy as well, generating an enormous amount of genomic information that's never before been available from exomes in early and late-stage patients, with long-term follow-up, it's going to create a whole new opportunity we're investing in significantly that will then further extend our leadership position. So I think there's a lot of opportunity on the table and we're well positioned. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. First, just one on guidance and then I have a couple on Signatera. Mike, how should we think about revenue pacing throughout this year kind of weighting in the first half versus the back half? And I'd imagine transplant and oncology as well as some of the average-risk ASP lift are likely more back-end loaded. \nMichael Brophy: Yes, that's exactly right. Thanks for that question. I mean, it is significantly back-end loaded. And part of that is, just the natural tempo of the business and the fact that you've got volumes growing through the course of the year, since the business is growing so quickly. Part of that is related to reimbursement, where you'll have broader reimbursement for things like, IO monitoring which will be contributing volumes in the first half and can start to contribute to actual revenues in the second half, so long as we can get the CMS reimbursement in place. So drivers like that do tend to put you kind of more back-end weighted this year.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. And then on Signatera RUO, you had $55 million of total contracted value at the end of 2019, added another $65 million to that last year. Can you just talk to how much that contributed to revenue in 2020? And when can we expect to see that ramp up more materially?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. So just to refresh everyone, I mean, the typical waterfall is, you sign a contract to do a pharma deal, it takes about a year from signing for the patients to start actually sending samples and you book whatever revenue you signed from that contract in years two and three post-signing, if that makes sense. So you can kind of see on that chart, you started in that kind of $9 million-ish range and then grew from there. And so that waterfall is pretty -- actually pretty high fidelity indication of where we landed for pharma revenues this year, kind of, high single low, double-digit kind of millions of revenues kind of the sense of that. And so that's just going to continue to ramp, much more so as you hit into these bigger studies. And that's why results like this Imvigor trial are so important to us. \nCatherine Schulte: Okay. And then on the breast cancer recurrence Phase II trial initiated by Mass Gen last year, are you still expecting a data readout sometime this year? And is it your thought that that would be enough to take to Medicare, or do you think you\u2019d have to wait for the Phase III data? \nSteve Chapman: Yes, I'll make a comment on that and then maybe Solomon, you can come in. So we actually announced two trials one with Pfizer and the other with Novartis that were looking at breast cancer treatment on molecular recurrence one -- both Phase II trials. And I think, we're excited about that because that's an enormous opportunity. I mean, the breast recurrence market is maybe five, six times bigger than the colorectal market. And that's an area where there are Phase III trials that we've competed for and we're feeling very, very good about. I do think that in order for physicians and pharma companies to be enabled to actually make that change, you'll need to see the Phase III data. But certainly, I think these Phase II trials will be good initial readouts. But there are Phase III trials underway that we look forward to making announcements in the near future. Solomon, would you like to make additional comments there?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Yes. Just echoing breast cancer is a hugely important area with a lot of unmet need and there are other studies that are underway that have not been announced yet. But yes, I agree with Steve that in terms of base case assumption, you need some strong level one data like Phase III data to really enable that. But there is upside potential. And we've seen before the breast cancer patient population. It's very active, very forward-thinking, a lot of patients who take matters into their own hands and push policy forward more than you see in some of the other cancer types. So, between that and a lot of the data, we'll be reading out earlier, I think there's some upside potential. But in general I agree with you Steve.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. And if I could sneak in one more -- go ahead. \nSteve Chapman: Yes, just going to say Catherine. As a reminder too, we just published some great data in neoadjuvant breast. And as you saw in the slide deck, we've had another peer-reviewed paper in breast cancer that's been accepted that we can't talk about now. But just adding to the massive amount of data that we have out there, one of the main things that separates Signatera from some of the other groups that are coming into MRD is the amount of data that we have. I mean, we have now eight accepted and published peer-reviewed papers and over 2,000 patients that have been studied. And when you look at some of the competitors that are now coming in that really don't have any peer-reviewed data yes, I think it's a very significant differentiator.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. Got it. And just sneaking one and you've talked a lot about early detection today. What's the general time line we should think about for hearing more about your early detection plans? And is your general thought to take a multi-cancer or single-cancer approach there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I think at this point, we haven't really released any of the details of our plans. And we're going to update everyone on that in the future when we're ready. What we're saying at this point is that, we have irons in the fire. We have some unique capabilities based on all the early stage exome data that we have. And we have a very targeted way from an investment standpoint to go after this market. So, we look forward to giving some future updates when those are ready. But we're really -- as you can see we didn't include any of the prepared remarks. We will do that in the future when we're ready, but we're just not -- we're not ready to do that today.\nCatherine Schulte: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions today and this also does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. The first slide here is on the addressable markets in liquid biopsy that we've shown before. Natera is the leader in MRD and monitoring and we are aggressively investing to maximize our first-mover advantage. We have hired up the commercial oncology team and we're well underway with our launch in colorectal cancer which is going very well. As Steve announced earlier, we're now launching Signatera for immunotherapy monitoring as well on the strength of both our peer-reviewed data in Nature Cancer published last year and our draft coverage decision from Medicare which we expect to be finalized later in this year. We're now also leveraging our leadership position in monitoring and MRD to expand into adjacent markets. We're excited today to announce the launch of Altera tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling or CGP for therapy selection. Therapy selection we believe is a $6 billion market opportunity with established reimbursement which makes a lot of sense for Natera given the growing strength of our customer relationships in oncology. Altera also pairs nicely with our launch of Signatera in immunotherapy monitoring which we'll go into more in a moment. Let's first dive into how Altera works. Altera reports genomic alterations found in the cancer across the full exome with extra boosted coverage in over 400 clinically relevant oncogenes. Altera is at the cutting-edge of therapy selection tests with its exome-wide coverage of nearly 20,000 genes, its full transcriptome-based RNA-seq analysis for optimal detection of structural rearrangements its matched normal DNA analysis to filter out germline mutation that can sometimes cause false positives and other tests and its ability to identify MSI status and gold standard TMB status based on the exome. Altera will be offered as a stand-alone test and also in conjunction with Signatera for those who want to combine therapy selection with personalized monitoring. A big advantage here is that Signatera is a tumor-informed test where whole exome sequencing is already performed on the tissue and normal DNA specimens from all Signatera patients to inform the personalized assay design. So now we can deliver the Altera CGP results seamlessly from the same specimens. This is a key advantage for advanced-stage patients where both CGP and treatment monitoring are both clinically indicated and where tissue can often be scarce. Now let me share a typical patient journey that includes both Altera and Signatera for a patient receiving immunotherapy. As we've discussed before over 200,000 patients per year are treated with immunotherapy, but an even higher number of patients are screened annually for immunotherapy eligibility. This eligibility assessment often depends on biomarker status including what alterations are found in the patient's tumor. For example the FDA has approved a pan-cancer indication for the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-high tumors or tumors with high Tumor Mutational Burden or TMB. We think that using our Altera test would be an efficient way for a treating physician to assess immunotherapy eligibility or eligibility for other targeted therapies and then use the pretreatment blood sample as the baseline for future treatment response monitoring with Signatera with no additional tissue specimen required. Both Altera and Signatera would be covered by Medicare in this scenario. So in our clinical business, we're now full steam ahead with early-stage colorectal cancer where we are enrolling nicely into the BESPOKE registry trial as commercial adoption of Signatera gains broader momentum. And now we're launching IO monitoring and Altera. We look forward to releasing more updates on the clinical market as time goes on. Now shifting gears to the pharma business. You see the rapid progression we've had these last two years since launch. This business has continued to mature as we have predicted and we're now seeing significant interest in larger Phase III studies which if successful can lead to having Signatera included in the drug's label as a companion diagnostic. Pharma is now using Signatera in studies of more than a dozen different cancer types. A key driver of this business is the compelling data that we've been able to generate from some of the clinical trials. The muscle-invasive bladder cancer data presented just a couple of months ago by Genentech at ESMO IO is an excellent case study. This was the IMVIGOR one trial which was a global Phase III randomized and controlled trial of atezolizumab. It took more than five years to run at great expense. Unfortunately the trial itself failed to meet its primary endpoint in all cumbers after cystectomy. But atezo improved overall survival by 41% for the Signatera-positive patients, which was 37% of the population. So with 581 patients analyzed, IMVIGOR 010 is by far the largest study evaluating any MRD assay. And it's the first ever randomized controlled Phase III trial presenting results stratified by MRD status. Critically the study shows how Signatera can take a trial that did not work in all-comers and make the results positive by getting the drug to the right patients who are MRD-positive. As you can imagine we've fielded a lot of interest after the results of this study. Going forward we expect most adjuvant trials to include some level of MRD-related stratification. And in addition we also are seeing the impact of this predictive data on how physicians in the clinical market are perceiving the utility of Signatera even in early-stage colorectal cancer and in other indications. So to summarize, in oncology we have a lot of activity underway to drive the business: clinical launch of Signatera and CRC now in IO monitoring; launch of Altera CGP to drive additional insights for our ordering physicians; and continuing to ramp in our pharma business. Beyond that this slide gives a good snapshot of the data that we've already published to date and our pipeline that we'll be reporting out over time. As you can see we have a significant head start in published data across a range of cancer types and that leadership creates its own momentum and network effect. The leading biopharma companies academic medical centers and community oncologists all have a strong incentive to use the most thoroughly validated technology for their patients and in their clinical trials which could in turn enable us to accelerate our lead in generating more data which eventually leads to more coverage and adoption in new clinical indications. It's a virtuous cycle. As Mike will cover in a second this demands a significant investment on our part. But the rationale for our patients and our business is very clear.  Now let me hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Steve, can I add a comment there? Yes. There's obviously a lot of opportunity here, Doug, you pointed out. And from my perspective, our first priority is to maintain and extend our leadership position in MRD, which has opened up so much opportunity to improve patients' lives. A huge amount of demand, just inbound coming in from the data and utility we've been able to generate. And if you think about -- there's some serious platform opportunity, when you think about two things.

And that's a very special type of long-term relationship that's less common historically in this industry.

So I think there's a lot of opportunity on the table and we're well positioned. Sure. Yes. Just echoing breast cancer is a hugely important area with a lot of unmet need and there are other studies that are underway that have not been announced yet.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Matt Rabinowitz",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. I decided to join the call today to highlight the significance of the team's achievement on the SMART trial, which was over five years in the making. The trial was designed to affirm the performance of our NIPT technology in the general population and in the detection of microdeletions. We have made some big predictions at Natera. These include that NIPT would be adopted and reimbursed in all risk categories and that our personalized oncology assay Signatera would achieve differentiated performance and reimbursement across multiple cancer indications. These have now occurred as we predicted because solid science usually prevails. Based on the exceptional performance of our technology in the SMART trial and the prevalence of microdeletions in the study, we now believe that professional guidelines can change and that microdeletions testing in NIPT will be more broadly reimbursed. SMART was an over 20,000-patient prospective clinical trial with 21 global centers. We collected pregnancy clinical outcomes as well as genetic truth samples from the fetus or the born children for 18,497 cases. This unprecedented data was used to showcase unique capabilities of Panorama, including Panorama AI. The AI or Artificial Intelligence component uses deep learning neural networks to model the sequencing data better than could be achieved by our team of classical statisticians. This amazing science was enabled by more than 1.6 million samples that we could use for training the deep learning network and the performance can continue to evolve with more samples. This is like a modern biotech equivalent of the competition between Kasparov and the supercomputer over the game of chess, which the supercomputer ultimately had to win. Panorama AI extends our leadership in women's health. Two major presentations came out of the trial and each are now being submitted for publication. First, SMART serves as the largest ever prospective aneuploidy NIPT trial and the only study of this scale to collect genetic outcomes at birth, setting a new bar in quality and science. The majority of the patients in the study were average-risk and we demonstrated best-in-class performance with 99% sensitivity and 99.97% specificity in Trisomy 21 with a positive predictive value in the general population of 95.1%. As a large number of newly adopting providers start using an NIPT, we think this study confers a significant advantage and further separates us from NIPTs that have limited or no peer-reviewed data. Panorama AI lowered the no call rate to roughly 1.5% while maintaining best-in-class accuracy. This category of cases that have very low fetal fraction were also clinically significant as these cases were at substantially increased risk for other conditions including preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. These add to the list of unique clinical differentiators, which have made Panorama the leading test. Second, SMART serves as a major advancement for microdeletion testing, rigorously validating Panorama's best-in-class performance and advanced and clinical knowledge of the most common microdeletions 22Q11.2. We showed excellent performance in detecting 22Q, as we expected detecting a 100% of cases of the most common microdeletion, 2.6 megabases or greater. Using Panorama AI, we were able to also detect the smaller microdeletions below 2.6 megabases, down to 0.7 megabases, which amounted to 41% of the disease load, significantly more than previously believed. Including microdeletions of all sizes in the 22Q region, we demonstrated a sensitivity of 83% and a positive predictive value of 53%. This performance is unique in the industry. Today, none of the mass parallel shotgun sequencing labs are testing for the smaller microdeletions, which is a critical issue given how common they are. This could prove to be a major competitive advantage for Natera. Clinically, 22Q microdeletions proved to be much more common than previously believed, but consistent with our estimates based on commercial experience. At an incidence of one in 1,525 this disorder is more common than cystic fibrosis at one in 4,000 or spinal muscular atrophy at one in 10,000 each of which are in the guidelines for screening and broadly reimbursed. In women under the age of 35 the incidence of this disorder neared that of Trisomy 21. Crucially none of these 22Q cases were detected at the first trimester ultrasound and only roughly half were detected by any other means throughout the pregnancy. We can't be prescriptive yet on timing but we think that the study should be sufficient to drive changes to society guidelines. We received a dedicated reimbursement code for microdeletions testing which is priced by CMS at $759 and we already run more than 400,000 of these tests annually which grew 37% year-on-year from 2019 to 2020. The next step is to get these data sets accepted for publication in high-impact journals. Back to you Steve."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let's get into the highlights. Q4 2020 was the best quarter we've ever had at Natera. We processed 295,000 tests, up 13% sequentially versus a very strong Q3 2020 and up 41% over Q4 2019. Revenues were $112 million, our first quarter above $100 million and product revenues were up 43% versus Q4 of last year. This represents the fastest quarterly net unit growth in company history. I'll get into more details on what's driving our performance in a moment. On top of 2020 being a great year for Natera, we enter 2021 with significant momentum across all of our businesses. In women's health, we've seen an acceleration in commercial payer coverage in average risk NIPT, even since we last spoke in November. As of January, all of the major national plans are covering NIPT for all women and we've seen significant adoption among state Medicaid plans. We also released the results of the SMART trial at the SMFM Conference in late January and we announced the validation of our new Panorama artificial intelligence platform. The final results from this trial were even stronger than expected and put us in an excellent position to achieve reimbursement for our microdeletions test and further drive market share gains within the NIPT space. Our growth is being further amplified by the progress we are making in the transplant business. We've collaborated with top KOLs to present data at each of the major academic conferences this winter. We've continued to produce data on Prospera's unique differentiators, including the ability to detect background cell-free DNA simultaneously from the same workflow, with no extra turnaround time or added cost. We believe this differentiator will be valuable for physicians. For example, the high level of background cell-free DNA we are seeing in patients affected by COVID-19 can mask rejection and we've completed a study highlighting our ability to assess when this might be occurring. All of these data sets are being submitted for publication. And I will spend more time on that when it comes out later this year. Overall, we continue to hit our internal volume growth targets for Prospera. And we're very pleased with how the transplant business is developing. In oncology, on the pharma side of the business, we announced in January that deals signed in 2020 exceeded $65 million up from $9 million two years ago. That business got a boost in December when Genentech's IMvigor study was presented. This was the first time an MRD assay has been evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial and the results for Signatera were compelling. On the clinical side of the business, our colorectal cancer launch is underway and we've now completed the build-out of our commercial team. This investment gives us a great jump-start as we seek to capitalize on our first-mover advantage. Now that the commercial team is in place, we can start executing on our plan to expand the Signatera indications and add other new products to their bag. I'm excited today to announce two oncology launches, Signatera I/O monitoring and Altera tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling which allows physicians to select targeted therapies for cancer patients. Altera can be ordered from the same tissue sample used to power Signatera, but will also be available as a stand-alone offering. There are significant synergies between the two tests, particularly in advanced-stage indications, where the use of a therapy selection panel is commonplace and reimbursed and the need for improved monitoring of patients for sponsored immunotherapy is clear. Altera fits right into the bag of the clinical field force we have in place for Signatera. And we think this combined offering will be compelling for oncologists. Solomon will get into more detail on that later in the call. Mike is going to get into details on the revised guide at the end of the call, but there are two major headlines. The first is that, we're guiding total revenues at $500 million to $525 million. And second, we expect the reproductive health business to get to a sustainable cash flow breakeven during 2021. Having our core women's health franchise cash flow breakeven, allows us to continue making substantial investments to maintain our leadership position in oncology for the long-term. This guide presumes, we keep the volume growth going across all three areas of the business, and that's exactly what we've seen so far this year in 2021. Going above the $500 million mark in revenues, and getting to cash flow breakeven in women's health are two major milestones that have been years in the making. And we're excited how to have these goals in sight. Okay. With that, let's get into some of the business trends. The next slide is our volume progression over time. Q4 represents a big step-up, even compared to our very strong Q3 performance. This breaks from historical trends where both. Q3 and Q4 have traditionally been more muted, providing a nice momentum into 2021. The volume growth we experienced in the second half of the year was driven by strong account retention and new business wins during the height of COVID-19, last spring and early summer. The mix in our women's health business between average risk and high-risk hasn't changed that much. We believe two potential future drivers of growth average-risk NIPT market penetration and a bump from the SMART trial are likely still in front of us. The next slide demonstrates that revenue growth is tracking nicely with volume growth, once again accelerating meaningfully over what we've seen in the past. If you just zero in on product revenues on the right-hand side, you'll see revenue growth rates of 43%. This removes development revenue from partners which was larger in 2019 than it is now. We saw recurring ASPs step-up again in Q4 versus prior periods and blended COGS remain in the low 200 range. The combination of consistent gross profit per test and volume growth that we talked about in the past is working as expected, allowing us to get the women's health business to cash flow breakeven, supporting even bigger investments in the oncology business. The payor response to the ACOG practice bullet has been stronger and faster than we anticipated last fall. We were really pleased to see all the major payors start covering NIPT in all women, and continue to see excellent progress among state Medicaid plans. This is positive not only for coverage but also for market penetration. As health plans expand coverage, many providers are changing their protocols from serum to NIPT. Given those trends, the timing of our SMART trial data readout is very timely. We are very pleased to be joined on the call today by Matt Rabinowitz, our Board Chairman and Natera's, Co-Founder, who helped initiate and steer this trial for several years. Matt? Thanks, Matt. Panorama is the market-leading NIPT. We performed over two million tests to date. We're uniquely leveraging the power of SNPs to deliver best-in-class performance and differentiated clinical value and the SMART trial further amplifies those differences. We studied more than 1.3 million patients in 23 peer-reviewed publications. With the completion of the SMART trials we now have the largest, most rigorous and the highest-quality validation data for both aneuploidy and microdeletion testing. Combined that with our seasoned clinical and commercial teams and we're very well positioned for the increase in NIPT adoption over the next several years. We believe the average risk NIPT market could get close to 75% to 90% penetration over the next three to five years which bodes well for our business, especially with the high and consistent attachment rates of both carrier screening and microdeletion testing to NIPT which further amplify the benefit of the expanding NIPT market penetration. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Solomon Moshkevich to cover some of the recent highlights in oncology. Solomon? Mike, you want to take them? Yes. This is Steve. Thanks Tejas. I'll take those. So, on the payer side, we think the most important thing is society guidelines. And we're at a position now generating this really gold standard evidence, the largest -- frankly the largest NIPT prospective trial that's ever been done but now doing that for microdeletions to have the type of data that societies will react favorably to. And so, once the papers published this summer, we expect to hear from the societies. And if you look at some of the press releases where the PIs on the study have been quoted, they've spoken very favorably about the opportunity here to change society guidelines. If that occurs, the payers will absolutely change their guidelines. So we look forward to the paper coming out followed by updated society guidelines and then payer policy following suit. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, last year we did 400,000 microdeletion tests and that was at a growth rate of 37% year-on-year versus 2019. So this is really a rocket-ship that's growing. We're running the tests. If we can get reimbursement, it's going to be -- we're going to be off to the races. When you look at, the first question, pre-eclampsia pre-term birth, we made a decision a long time ago to not report out results at extremely low fetal fraction, because we thought that there's something biologically going on there that is important for the physicians to not get tripped by and to not just get a negative NIPT result when there might be something more going on there. And now, it turns out that not only is fetal fraction and important as a quality control metric in getting an accurate annuality or microdeletion result, but patients that have low fetal fraction actually are at risk for pre-term birth, fetal demise, pre-eclampsia, at very significant levels. So we look forward to seeing, again, how physicians and the KOL community want to digest this information. With the Panorama AI algorithm, we were seeing percentages -- risk percentages of a 15%, 16%, 17%, risk to the pregnancy. And that's very significant compared to other biomarkers that are out there. So it's unlikely that will be a standalone test. But it's important when you're getting a no callback that you can get this extra information that no other laboratory can provide. Yes. So, we did spend a lot of time today talking about organ health, but that's an area where we continue to invest. And we're actually doing really well in 2020. I think we mentioned at the JPMorgan Conference that we actually beat our pre-COVID estimates for Prospera. So, we're pleased with the performance of the test. We're pleased with the interactions we've had with key opinion leaders. And certainly, we keep our eyes on some of these ancillary opportunities. You have to sort of decipher whether it fits in with the broader strategy at Natera -- these ancillary services whether they fit in with the broader strategy of Natera and whether they fit in with the strategy of interacting with patients and physicians. And if it does then we're certainly going to take a look. But we're keeping our finger on the pulse and it's an area that we think has an enormous opportunity to grow in the future. Thanks. Yeah. So on the Signatera IO side, the test is CLIA validated. We have a peer-reviewed publication that came out in Nature Genetics last summer that serves as a validation study. So it's on the market now through our sales force in the CLIA environment clinical offering. So it's available to pharma as well as a CLIA test, but it is being sold through the commercial clinical sales force at this point. Now we're getting out there pre-reimbursement and we expect reimbursement to come in at some point this summer. And as you build the ramp when you initially launch something in the earlier days, the volume coming in and the ramp is less significant. So we think we'll be hitting our stride right around the time that that reimbursement comes in. The great thing about the Altera launch is that it's the same tissue sample and it's going to be very convenient for physicians to be able to order Altera, get the information back on therapy selection and tumor mutational burden MSI status, and then the ongoing monitoring and surveillance with personalized Signatera. Now the reimbursement for Altera is already established, so we can piggyback on the broad reimbursement that's already in place there. And that's one of the reasons why we thought it made sense to launch this and to add it to the bag. Yeah. I mean, if you look at the opportunity and the percentage of patients that are eligible for IO monitoring and then how that decision is made on who's eligible for IO treatment, it does seem like the vast majority of the time someone is setting up for potential Signatera that they're going to want Altera. No. We think about the Foundation partnership as separate. I mean, Foundation medicine is really the leader in tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling. And the product that we're working on with them is going to be a therapy monitoring product that is based on their FoundationOne CDx product, which is a targeted panel comprehensive genomic profile. So they have a large team in place. They have a big customer base. And whenever somebody orders that FoundationOne CDx, they'll be eligible to design personalized primers. So we think about our exome-based Altera and Signatera as an independent offering. And together we're going to approach this market. Yeah. So I mean look the societies respond to peer-reviewed data and this is the study that is going to change -- move the needle. If you look at the studies that move the needle for noninvasive prenatal testing in high risk or even in average risk, they were significantly smaller than this and less rigorous than this study. So a study of this magnitude with this level of clinical outcome has never been done before. So if you were to go back and design the perfect study that the societies would respond positively to this is it. And at the outset when we met with the key opinion leaders and society members and we said, what do you need to see in order to change society guidelines? They said two things, a disease incidence that is in line with expectations. And at that time it was thought that 22Q had a prevalence of about one in 2,000. In the study, we showed that it was about one at 1,500. So it's actually more common than what was thought. And the second thing was, we have to show a high sensitivity and a high positive predictive value. And we've done both of those. So the sensitivity in the microdeletions of above 2.6 megabases was 100%. And for all microdeletions -- all 22q microdeletions it was 83%. And the positive predictive value was 53%. So if you think about aneuploidy screening overall, serum screening has a positive predicted value of 5%. And so NIPT and aneuploidy has a higher PPV 80% to 90% for trisomy 21 and lower for the other aneuploidy trisomy 18 and 13. So this performance is right in there now with the top common aneuploidies. So we feel very positive about it. It's a severe genetic disorder that has a significant outcome on live births. There's a screening test that works very, very well. The gold standard study has been done. And the results came out very positively. So it's exactly what you would need in order to change guidelines. Now, of course, we can't promise anything, but this is exactly what you would want. It's a perfect setup for a guideline change. And if guidelines do change the payers certainly will change. And we're looking forward to the publication coming out at some point this summer. Yes. So we're looking at multiple different things. That includes rapidly expanding Signatera indications. So while we work on commercializing colorectal and IO monitoring, we're looking at a long list of additional indications. We think eventually Signatera will be a pan-cancer assay and we're working on generating the data and multiple different indications as we've shown in the slide deck. But we're also looking at other ways that we can penetrate to the $50 billion liquid biopsy market. We talked today about tissue-based therapy selection. But we think that there's a lot more that Natera can do to leverage the strength of our technology across the entire $50 billion TAM. And you can certainly believe we have irons in the fire in each of those circles that we've shown in the slide deck. Yes. Thanks, Doug. I apologize actually my phone broke up for the first half of the quarter. Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. Thanks, Doug. So I think first, we've been doing a lot of hiring in R&D and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we put out. And we have a really solid team in place. So we've been working on different things. Yes. I think we're excited about the Altera launch. We think this is the first step into the $6 billion therapy selection opportunity.  We do think that looking at liquid therapy selection and asymptomatic screening makes place, but -- makes sense. But I think we're going to make smart decisions and be very targeted with our efforts. We do have some unique advantages. For example, we can -- we're doing a lot of early-stage exomes at this stage and that gives us information that others don't have access to that we can leverage to design assays that can perform well in an asymptomatic environment. So we're doing things in a very targeted manner on asymptomatic screening, but it is something that we're looking at. And I think as that program develops, we'll release more information.  On the tissue side and on the liquid therapy selection side, these techniques are the same techniques that we use for other assays. And we have very skilled team members and I think we're in a great position to put good tests out on the market. And yes, we'll be very competitive. What we're trying to do is leverage the commercial footprint that we've put in place and offer a full menu back to physicians.  So the oncology team that we built is top-quality, high-quality medical staff, sales staff, MSL staff. And when they're meeting with a physician, especially where there's significant amount of synergies, like there are with IO monitoring and Altera, it makes a lot of sense to capitalize on these different opportunities. Yes. Sure, Solomon. Yes, I'll make a comment on that and then maybe Solomon, you can come in. So we actually announced two trials one with Pfizer and the other with Novartis that were looking at breast cancer treatment on molecular recurrence one -- both Phase II trials. And I think, we're excited about that because that's an enormous opportunity. I mean, the breast recurrence market is maybe five, six times bigger than the colorectal market. And that's an area where there are Phase III trials that we've competed for and we're feeling very, very good about. I do think that in order for physicians and pharma companies to be enabled to actually make that change, you'll need to see the Phase III data. But certainly, I think these Phase II trials will be good initial readouts. But there are Phase III trials underway that we look forward to making announcements in the near future. Solomon, would you like to make additional comments there? Yes, just going to say Catherine. As a reminder too, we just published some great data in neoadjuvant breast. And as you saw in the slide deck, we've had another peer-reviewed paper in breast cancer that's been accepted that we can't talk about now. But just adding to the massive amount of data that we have out there, one of the main things that separates Signatera from some of the other groups that are coming into MRD is the amount of data that we have. I mean, we have now eight accepted and published peer-reviewed papers and over 2,000 patients that have been studied. And when you look at some of the competitors that are now coming in that really don't have any peer-reviewed data yes, I think it's a very significant differentiator. Yes. So I think at this point, we haven't really released any of the details of our plans. And we're going to update everyone on that in the future when we're ready. What we're saying at this point is that, we have irons in the fire. We have some unique capabilities based on all the early stage exome data that we have. And we have a very targeted way from an investment standpoint to go after this market. So, we look forward to giving some future updates when those are ready. But we're really -- as you can see we didn't include any of the prepared remarks. We will do that in the future when we're ready, but we're just not -- we're not ready to do that today."

And now I would like to turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s get into the highlights. Q3 was another very strong quarter for Natera. The work we\u2019ve been doing for the last 5 years has really started to deliver results. I will just hit the high points on this slide and then get into more detail on each of these topics on the call. In Q3, we processed 262,000 tests, which represents 31% growth versus last year and 12% versus the second quarter of this year. This is a record quarter in several respects. For example, this is the best sequential quarterly growth we\u2019ve seen in Q3 since 2015, when the business was a small fraction of the size we are today. We generated revenues of $98.1 million, which is again a record and is up 13% from Q2 2020 and 26% from Q3 2019. This revenue growth was largely driven by product revenues, which was up 39% year-on-year. As most of you saw, after years of effort, we were very pleased to see a position statement from ACOG and SMFM supporting NIPT in all pregnancies. The statement included a table highlighting the superior performance of NIPT, and specifically, highlighted unique aspects of the SNP-based technology, including the detection of triploidy and zygosity in twin pregnancies. We have already seen a significant amount of momentum among payers adding average-risk NIPT to their coverage policies, and we could see significant additions to that list in the near term. This development aligns nicely with the timing of the completion of the SMART trial. The SMART trial is a prospective 20,000-patient multisite clinical trial with newborn genetic outcomes, and that has taken 5 years to run. We think a study of this magnitude and scale will never be repeated, and therefore, could become the gold standard in NIPT for the foreseeable future. The data has been unblinded to us and to the investigators in the trial. And we believe the results have the potential to further drive market share in NIPT and may unlock guidelines on reimbursement for microdeletions, which is already more than 100,000 units per quarter for Natera. We expect the data to be presented at the SMFM conference early next year. We have continued to make excellent progress in the transplant space. We executed our full commercial launch this summer after securing a final reimbursement in May, and we have continued to develop compelling data on our Prospera test. In Q3, we published a clinical utility study, and we announced a unique program highlighting the overlap of cancer and transplantation. We have recently made significant strides in our oncology business as well. We received a positive final coverage decision from Medicare for Signatera in Stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer and we received another draft local coverage decision for our immunotherapy monitoring indication we just introduced on the August earnings call. Together, these indications represent nearly 2 million Signatera tests per year. Additionally, we continue to see growth in our pharma business. For example, we are excited to announce a trial with Pfizer and another with Novartis, where Signatera was selected to evaluate patients receiving CDK4/6 therapy in early-stage breast cancer. If successful, we expect that positive data from these and other trials would continue to expand the addressable market for Signatera. Finally, we continue to build on our leadership position in published data. We expect to present four posters at the SITC conference in November, followed by significant new data in an oral presentation at the ESMO IO conference, with two spotlight poster presentations at San Antonio Breast in December as well. These datasets have all been submitted to top journals for publication next year. Based on the success we have had in Q3, we\u2019re excited today to significantly raise our 2020 revenue guidance. Mike will get into the specific details of that at the end of the call. Okay. Now let\u2019s get into some of the business trends. The next slide shows our volume progression over time and highlights a large acceleration in volumes we saw in Q3. This was a blowout quarter for us. We are pleased with the initial volumes in organ health and in the pre-launch phase of Signatera. Those launches are both on track and doing very well. The bulk of this performance comes from the core reproductive health business hitting on all cylinders. Post-ACOG, we are seeing an uptick in accounts ordering average-risk NIPT, and we have continued to benefit from closing new customers as well. Also, as you would expect, when the clinic starts ordering Panorama from us, we have an opportunity to educate the practice on our carrier screening offering, which serves to amplify the effect of these trends in our business. The next slide shows our total revenue progression, and a lot of the same trends are at work here. In addition to accelerating top line revenue, as you can see, product revenue growth compared to Q3 of last year was also very strong. Q3 saw revenue contributions from our new businesses as well. As I said in the introduction, this is the time we\u2019ve really been working for over the past 5 years, where the success that we\u2019ve had in organ health and oncology has now started to contribute to revenues. We\u2019re not breaking out the new businesses for competitive reasons here, but it\u2019s exciting to see some of the green shoots in these very large markets. The next slide is our standard average selling price per unit and blended COGS comparison. On the ASPs, you can see again the business is going very well. We have continued to grind upward in the women\u2019s health business, and we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of average-risk reimbursement coming in. And as I mentioned, we had a small but noticeable contribution from the new business units as well. We are pleased to see blended COGS dip back down again in Q3 as we got some scale benefits on infrastructure investments we made in Q1 and Q2, like expanding our lab footprint in Austin. This chart was historically a great metric for tracking our path to profitability in the women\u2019s health business. Given our volume growth, ASP and COGS execution, we now see a clear line of sight to reaching cash flow breakeven in the women\u2019s health business in the first half of 2021, which is a major achievement for Natera. It\u2019s gratifying to see the key pieces of our long-standing plan come together like this. Now that the product mix is shifting a bit, this blended ASP and COGS approach is going to lose some relevance as a way to track our progress in women\u2019s health. For example, even though we keep making progress on NIPT and carrier screening COGS per unit, we expect blended COGS to move up in Q4 because we are going to be running a lot more exomes for the first time point in Signatera patients. We\u2019ll continue to talk about ASP and COGS, and we will comment on how it\u2019s going in women\u2019s health, but we will be moving away from these blended metrics. Okay, next slide. Speaking of average-risk NIPT, I wanted to spend another minute on some of you \u2013 for some of you that might be newer to Natera. So this next slide shows the practice bulletin that came out in August. This statement from ACOG and SMFM supports aneuploidy screening in all patients regardless of maternal age or baseline risk and highlights, for the first time that NIPT can be performed in twin pregnancies. The bulletin also highlights unique aspects of SNP-based technology, including the detection of triploidy, use as early as 9 weeks and the ability to assess zygosity in individual fetal fraction when testing twins. As the only SNP-based NIPT available today, these advantages are unique to Natera and help us differentiate in the market. As a reminder, the U.S. market for NIPT consists of about 4 million to 5 million pregnancies per year and is very underpenetrated in the average-risk setting, which makes up 80% of those pregnancies. So we still have a significant room to run in the NIPT space. We think the ACOG statement is already having a positive impact on NIPT volumes, and we are seeing momentum with payers changing coverage policies for both average-risk and twin pregnancies. The next slide shows some of the progress with payers in more detail. The acceleration we\u2019ve seen in 2020 is really incredible, and it\u2019s picked up even more since the ACOG bulletin. Notably, we were very pleased to recently see payers like Humana and Centene join the majority of payers covering NIPT for all women. Payers with positive coverage policies now in place comprise more than 200 million covered lives. There are still some notable exceptions, of course, like UnitedHealthcare, but it\u2019s been important to see a wave of very large and prominent payers quickly changing their coverage policies post the ACOG. In addition to the average-risk changes, some new policies also now include coverage for twin pregnancies as well, which provides additional upside for Natera. Now moving on to organ health, as I mentioned, we executed our full commercial launch of Prospera in Q2 of 2020. We\u2019ve been pleased with our performance, thus far, and have continued to make meaningful relationships with top key opinion leaders in key centers. In Q3, we published new data showing the clinical utility of Prospera. The study concluded that practicing nephrologists who used the Prospera test detected more cases of rejection and made better clinical decisions than physicians in the control group. The study evaluated kidney transplant patients at typical scenarios seen in routine practice. We think continued data generation is important for the overall donor-derived cell-free DNA market, and we are very pleased with how this study read out. In addition, in Q3, we announced an expansive program to improve care for organ transplant patients with a history of cancer. The goal of this program is to understand how Signatera and Prospera can be used together to improve clinical decision-making and respond to the unmet medical needs within these communities. We look forward to giving further updates on our progress in the future. Now I would like to hand the call over to Solomon to cover some of the recent highlights in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. The next slide should look familiar. This is the same pathway to reimbursement that we started presenting when we first received the draft local coverage decision last year in colorectal cancer. As a reminder, there are roughly 145,000 patients in the U.S. diagnosed every year with colorectal cancer, and about two-thirds of them have Stage 2 or Stage 3 disease. So with the repeat testing described in the Medicare coverage policy, this would imply roughly 1 million tests per year as a total addressable market. As we expected, we now have the final coverage decision for this indication from Medicare, which went into effect on October 18. We are continuing to work with CMS to finalize pricing, and we are nearing the finish line. The process for pricing is company- and assay-specific, and the final pricing will not be publicly posted by the agency. So for competitive reasons, we do not plan to disclose final pricing when it is completed. We think we have a good sense, however, on where we are likely to land. And we are pleased that the pricing is likely to be consistent with what other companies are receiving for MRD testing in oncology. We expect to be able to bill for patient volumes starting as of the October 18 effective date. As a result, we are now moving into the formal commercial launch phase for Signatera in the clinical setting for colorectal cancer, and we plan to build on the momentum we\u2019ve seen in the pre-launch phase. As Steve mentioned, we are also significantly ahead of schedule with our immunotherapy response monitoring indication that was just introduced on our last earnings call in Q2. More than 200,000 patients are estimated to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors every year across a range of cancer types, and that number is growing with every successful new pharma trial. While immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care in many ways, it is expensive, and the majority of patients do not respond to this type of treatment. One particular challenge is how to determine whether the treatment is working after it has been initiated and when it may be appropriate to discontinue or switch treatment strategies. For example, if a patient is not responding to treatment, you would expect the tumor to get larger over time on a scan. However, up to 1 in 10 immunotherapy-treated patients see their tumor get bigger on a scan before it gets smaller because it\u2019s being filled with lymphocytes and swelling up under attack from the immune system. With a CT scan, this swelling looks like disease progression, which is why it\u2019s called pseudo-progression. As a result of these types of uncertainties, as illustrated in the graphic, current treatment guidelines for immunotherapy suggest that physicians continue treating beyond progression until they see confirmation of progression in a follow-up scan, approximately 6 to 12 weeks later. This extra treatment can significantly delay sick patients from switching to other available lines of therapy that may be more effective or it can also result in premature discontinuation for a patient who may actually be responding to the treatment. Based on the data that we published just this summer in Nature Cancer, we think a serial testing protocol with Signatera could help improve this picture, setting a baseline ctDNA measurement before treatment and then following up regularly in conjunction with imaging to help identify true disease progression earlier and to help identify exceptional responders who have achieved ctDNA clearance and who may be eligible for a drug holiday. So if you assume about 4 Signatera tests per year for over 200,000 patients, we think the addressable market for Signatera in this indication could exceed 800,000 tests per year, as we described in August. The next slide summarizes the favorable draft local coverage decision that we received in response to our application to Medicare in IO monitoring. We submitted the dossier for reimbursement to Medicare this summer, just after we published the Nature Cancer publication. And we received the draft LCD ahead of schedule in September. And we were very pleased that Medicare proposed coverage for IO monitoring across solid tumor types based on the strength of our data. We now expect to get final coverage and pricing in 2021, previously, we had not planned to get there until 2022. I also want to give a quick example of the type of work we are doing with pharmaceutical companies. This slide describes the DARE study, where we are working with Pfizer. In this study, Signatera will be used for patient selection and ongoing monitoring in early-stage, ER-positive breast cancer. Patients who test MRD-positive by Signatera will be randomized into an active arm in which they get palbociclib plus fulvestrant or into a control arm, where they get the standard-of-care endocrine therapy. If studies like these are successful, it would pave the way for Signatera usage in the large early-stage breast cancer recurrence monitoring market. Pharma demand has been growing rapidly for us. We continue to win business from new customers, and our repeat business from our largest pharma clients is continuing to grow, consistent with trends we described in August. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we look forward to Signatera data being presented in three different conferences before the end of this year, including new breast cancer data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer meeting in December and new bladder cancer data in an oral presentation at ESMO IO, also in December. These data will be really novel and will contribute meaningfully to the data leadership position we have developed in MRD. Now, let me hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The slide here is just a summary set of results for the quarter. Steve covered volumes, revenues and COGS. Product revenues really drove the quarter, and the revenue recognition we were getting from \u2013 as we signed the partnership deals with BGI and Foundation Medicine was significantly lower in Q3. That development-related revenue recognition has largely run its course as the projects shift toward commercialization in the future. So despite that transition away from partnership revenue recognition, which is very high margins, overall gross margins still managed to increase meaningfully over the last year. This speaks to the improvement in average selling prices and cost of goods sold per unit that Steve presented. A couple of other items to note on the expenses side, when we spoke in August, we described that our business has responded really well despite the pandemic and we are scaling up, particularly in our pharma operations channel to meet increased demand. We have accelerated our plans to support that growth, and that has started to be noticeable in our operating expenses. That increase in investment has been balanced against improving cash flows from the business. So as I will talk about on the next slide, our cash burn range for the year is actually poised to be better than our previous guide. As many of you know, we were very pleased to execute a follow-on equity offering in the quarter, where we took net proceeds of roughly $271 million and now have a total cash and investment position of over $800 million. This cash position, along with our expectation that the women\u2019s health business crosses over the cash flow breakeven threshold next year, means that we are very well situated to make the investments necessary to support the new products. Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next slide and the revised guide. From the left to right, you see how the guide has evolved from the beginning of the year, which we set out before we had any inkling of the impact of COVID-19. Despite the pandemic, we were one of the few companies in our space to reinstate a substantially higher guide on our Q2 call, as you see in the middle of the page and now we are raising again as you see on the right column. The new revenue guide of $380 million to $390 million incorporates the strong volume performance through the first three quarters of the year and anticipates that the underlying trends in the business remain stable. The high end gives room for continued acceleration in ASP and volume trends, and the low end of the range acknowledges the possibility that volumes through the year could be a bit lumpier. And we still, of course, have a lot of unknowns in the environment as we are watching the COVID case counts seemingly accelerate here more recently. Gross margins imply that we are comfortable in this mid-40% range for now. Again, there could be some lumpiness with more Signatera exomes getting run in Q4. So that is why we left some range in the guide there. But we do feel comfortable enough with the full year results that we could tighten to the upside, as you see on the page. OpEx investments will continue, as we described and we are pleased to tighten the cash burn guide below the high end back into our original range for the year, as I talked about. So overall, we are very pleased with all the momentum in the business, and we really appreciate everyone\u2019s support. With that, let me hand it back to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nSubhalaxmi Nambi: Hey, good afternoon. This is Subbu on for Doug Schenkel. Thank you for taking my questions. First, on Signatera, the draft LCD mentioned the possible use of Signatera for other solid tumors. Is this tied to patients who have been treated with IO drugs or is it different? And if different, how much more addressable market would that add? And I have a follow-up.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, thank you for asking that question. I really appreciate it. So I would say, first, we are super excited about the final LCD that we have just received for colorectal, which is an enormous market, over 1 million patients per year in Stage 2 and 3 and there is an opportunity to expand that further, for example with some advanced colorectal cancer patients on the oligometastatic stage that we published this summer at the ESMO conference. So we look forward to getting that under coverage and expanding that indication. For IO monitoring, the initial coverage that we submitted just for that IO monitoring indication is an additional 800,000 patients, so again, like massive expansion of the market. There is an opportunity for us to expand it further into other tumor types even beyond IO monitoring. And we think that, again, we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of that. The most important thing is generating data. And as you\u2019ve seen, we \u2013 now we have 5 or 6 marquee peer-reviewed publications. And we have two more very significant datasets that are, I would say, on the order of magnitude of our Nature Cancer publication that are going to be reading out initially at some of the conferences later this year and then published in the first half of next year. So we do have a path to expand to other cancer types. And that\u2019s how we really tap into that $18 billion TAM. So getting the data is super important, and that\u2019s an area where we now have a lead with the publications that we\u2019ve put out. And I think we said before, we have 25 additional biobanks that are in-house that we are going to be running and publishing additional data on over time, and then at least two of them that we think will be very significant and published in the near future.\nSubhalaxmi Nambi: Got it. That\u2019s really, really helpful. The second one is on the sales strategy for Signatera, you have had 25 sales reps. And then with the recent financing, you were planning to expand your reach. How is the hiring progressing? And where do you think you\u2019ll be in early 2021? And at a very high level, what would be your sales strategy, because you aim to penetrate this big market? Is the focus to \u2013 is the plan to focus on the 250 Tier 1 or 2 institutions or is there another way to think about the market pyramid?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So what we said before is that we \u2013 at the beginning of the year, we sort of hired up 25 oncology sales reps that would help us in that kind of pre-launch phase. And then after we fully commercialize, we\u2019d expand that over time. And I think now that we\u2019ve gotten the final coverage decision, it puts us in a position to be able to add more sales reps. We have incrementally added a few over time. But we\u2019re also making investments in other areas: product life cycle; clinical data generation; clinical trials, like you have seen with the big prospective BESPOKE registry study that we\u2019ve announced; society and KOL relationships. So there is a lot of investments across the business and across each functional area going into oncology that go well beyond just sales. Certainly, our strategy is to make relationships with top academic centers and key opinion leaders, and then in addition, cover the community oncology practices. And we are looking to be in a position to execute that and continue on the success that we\u2019ve had. The early evidence is looking very, very good. We are pleased with how we are doing. And I think we are executing on all cylinders on the clinical launch.\nSubhalaxmi Nambi: Thank you so much. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nEleni Apostolatos: Hi, thanks. This is Eleni on for Tycho. Congrats on a strong quarter. My first question is a follow-up on Signatera, good to see the final LCD and commercial launch in the quarter. But I was wondering, can you give us more color on expectations for the Signatera ramp in 4Q and possibly an initial sense of the ramp next year? I believe The Street is modeling about $5 million to $10 million in sales for Signatera in 2021. And with only 1% penetration of the MRD market, you \u2013 it\u2019s closer to $30 million to $50 million. So a question we have been getting is how quickly can you ramp and how can we start to think about that?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I will make a couple of comments. And then Mike, maybe you can jump in. Yes, so if you go back and you look at any other specialty diagnostic company that has launched a novel product, back \u2013 when Foundation Medicine was launching the conference on genomic profiling or Guardant launching liquid biopsy, there\u2019s a pretty kind of similar cadence of what the penetration looks like over the first couple of years. And you have to go out and really train the physicians on a novel concept and a novel product, and that doesn\u2019t flip on like a light switch overnight. A lot of times, they want to trial it out. They want to see what the KOLs in the area are doing. They want to see some data. So there is a lot of effort that goes into building the market and getting the ramp. We published some great initial commercial experience data. If you go back and look at what was available at ASCO or the summer at ESMO, you can see some of the engagement we have in the commercial \u2013 in the early pre-commercial launch with some of the top key opinion leaders. So we\u2019re excited about how things are going. We think we\u2019re going to be kind of right in there with the ramps of some of these extremely successful companies like Guardant and Foundation when they went out, and we\u2019re expecting to have a kind of similar type of penetration over time to what they\u2019ve been able to do. And frankly, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. Mike, you want to comment on that?\nMichael Brophy: No. I think you covered it well.\nEleni Apostolatos: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is as we think about sort of penetration in the average-risk NIPT market going up from where it is today, around 15%, how confident are you that you can maintain the \u2013 your level of market share? I believe you have stayed at around 55% or so in the past or how should we think about you potentially gaining share in this environment?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So that\u2019s a great question. And so this is effectively the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for on average-risk. I mean, for years, we\u2019ve been behind the scenes, doing the clinical trials, putting the teams in place, building the user experience capabilities, logistics capabilities to be able to expand in this very large underpenetrated average-risk market. So today, there\u2019s 3.2 million pregnancies every year that are average-risk. And despite NIPT now being available for 8 years commercially, that average-risk market is only about 25% penetrated. We believe we have slightly more than 50% of the market share. And we\u2019ve continued to gain share and grow that business, both from expanding average-risk usage in our existing customer base, and especially, we\u2019ve seen that actually accelerating in the last month or so, 1.5 months post the guidelines, but also competitive takeaways. And when you look at the unique clinical aspects that Panorama offers for noninvasive prenatal testing and you combine that with the massive data trove that we have that really dwarfs the clinical data than any other NIPT has on the market. Just that package, combined with our seasoned sales team and our extreme focus on user experience, is playing very, very well. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of receptivity. And also note that, really, for the first time, we saw ACOG and SMFM actually call out the unique benefits of the SNP-based technology, things like triploidy that none of the other technologies can test for or things like zygosity on twin gestations that none of the other technologies can test for. Now, those are actually now written into the guidelines as advantages of the SNP-based platform. So it\u2019s rare that you see that type of thing, but we\u2019re super excited that, that\u2019s now been incorporated in the guidelines. So we\u2019re in a position to continue growing and maintaining our share and riding the wave of NIPT expansion as the market becomes much more penetrated over the next several years.\nEleni Apostolatos: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one last question, can you update us on your partnership with BGI? And what is the latest on the time line for the launch of Signatera in China? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we actually have a couple of really fantastic partnerships in Signatera. One, with Foundation Medicine, where they\u2019re going to be designing personalized monitoring off of a baseline of FoundationOne CDx. And we think that\u2019s a great opportunity for us in both biopharma and the clinical setting, where they are really in a dominant position. And then we\u2019ve announced our partnership with the Beijing Genomics Institute in China. So BGI is the dominant cell-free DNA and sequencing provider in China. They\u2019ve done more testing than anybody. They\u2019re going to be launching Signatera onto both clinical setting and then also as a pharma service provider. So we\u2019ve seen with big multinational pharma companies that they want to get their drug on the market in China. And in order for them to get the drug on the market, they have to run trials in China. And that means you have to have a partner on the ground in China. So we think this is an advantage. We\u2019ve signed very good global pharma trials that include a China arm with BGI, and we look forward to them launching and servicing those trials. So we\u2019re ready this year to start servicing those customers. And we think some of the sample flow will really start to ramp up as we go into 2021.\nEleni Apostolatos: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Yuko on for Tejas. Thank you for taking our questions. For Prospera, can you update us on traction among transplant centers now that things have sequentially improved relative to the COVID pandemic? Are there any centers where the volumes are on par with your closest competitor? And what do repeat ordering patterns look like at this early stage of the commercial launch? Heading into 2021, how should we expect adoption curve to accelerate as you launch your quantification ability as well as the PEDAL study reads out?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So yes, those are great questions. I think our hypothesis going into the transplant business was that we could compete very well with the incumbents. And I\u2019m pleased with the performance of our team. So we are meeting our plan despite the impact of COVID. We\u2019re seeing very strong receptivity, expanding our relationships with many centers and many key opinion leaders. You can see from some of the press releases that we\u2019ve done around our data that we\u2019re generating at conferences that we\u2019re working with really the A-list of key opinion leaders. So I\u2019m pleased with how we\u2019re doing. We do think that we\u2019re going to continue to grow that business as we turn the corner into next year. I think we have a couple of new data points that just read out actually. We announced this summer that we could quantify the background DNA and that could have an impact on the donor-derived cell-free DNA. And then just last week at the ASM conference, we had major key opinion leaders talking about the clinical utility of testing for background DNA. And one really amazing example was that we were able to identify patients, who actually had COVID, who had a 57x background DNA. And that\u2019s the type of thing that you can really now only get with the Prospera product. So we\u2019re excited about what the future holds. We\u2019re bringing our innovation and expertise that we\u2019ve developed over the years in cell-free DNA to bear in organ transplant to help patients. And we\u2019re very pleased with the performance and how we\u2019re doing. And I think now you can \u2013 I mean, if you look at our revenue numbers and volume numbers, we blew it out this quarter, right? And some of that revenue increase, like we said, from the first time now, we\u2019re really seeing the impact of these new business units. And so we\u2019re pleased to see that happening as we thought it would.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to get a sense on \u2013 and I apologize if this has been covered, in terms of Signatera, pricing updates, if you can provide? And in terms of IO indication expansion, that was great to see. But just wanted to get a sense of anything else, any other studies that you are planning here in terms of indication expansion with \u2013 on the Signatera product?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I will make a couple of comments and then maybe Solomon, you can jump in. So first, on other indications and other data sets, I would strongly recommend you tune into the ESMO IO conference and the San Antonio Breast conference because there\u2019s going to be some very compelling data there, and we think it \u2013 on the level of the data that we\u2019ve published in Nature Cancer and some of our other marquee publications. So the key to generating additional opportunities and unlocking additional opportunities is data, and that is an area that we have a very significant leadership. Now with 5 to 6 peer-reviewed publications in top journals and a big trove of additional papers that are going to be reading out over time, we have roughly 25 additional biobanks that are in-house that we\u2019re going to be publishing on and reading out over time. And then we have two very significant prospective studies that we\u2019ll be reading out this year, and they\u2019ll be discussed at these conferences, and then they should be published next year. So I mean we\u2019ve \u2013 this is just the beginning. Although I want to reiterate, colorectal and IO together make up around 2 million tests per year. If you compare that to some of the other oncology diagnostic opportunities that are out there that are in the range of, say, 400,000 tests per year TAM, I mean, we\u2019re talking about orders of magnitude bigger than anything else out there and it\u2019s covered, and it\u2019s just the beginning. So we are super excited about that. Now on pricing, we are in the process of wrapping things up right now with Medicare. The discussions have been going very well. We expect to have it wrapped, I would say, probably in the next 2 weeks, roughly. And it\u2019s exactly sort of in line with where we thought it would be. We\u2019ve said now on this call, because of the uniqueness of our product and the unique situation of doing recurrent monitoring of cancer patients and the bespoke nature of our test, that we have some unique pricing strategies. And we\u2019re not going to actually publicly announce anything because we think it\u2019s confidential to us, and we don\u2019t want to give our playbook away to all the competitors. But we\u2019re very positive about the way things are going. And we should have it wrapped up in the next couple of weeks and then be able to bill retroactively back to that October 18 start point. Solomon, do you have anything to add to that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: I think that was a great answer. I will just add that we have been really pleased to partner with Medicare on this. And they\u2019ve really been supportive of the pan-cancer nature of the product, which is what you\u2019re seeing with the new draft LCD. So we\u2019re excited about the future here.\nPuneet Souda: That\u2019s great. And then, Steve, if I could ask a broader question. You guys have published early data sets and lead in this market in MRD setting, in CRC and then expanding beyond that into IO. Just sort of when you look at this market potentially 5 years out with a tumor-informed assay in hand, and there are competitors that have tumor-naive assay, other products are emerging in the space. Sort of give us a sense of how do you think this market is likely to play out longer term? Because, obviously, you\u2019ve operated in competitive markets before, but this is one where there is a significant amount of Greenfield opportunity, and you are ahead in that pack. So maybe just give us a sense as to how you see this market longer term? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So look, we think that this space of MRD and recurrence monitoring and therapy effectiveness monitoring is very large, $18 billion of pan-cancer opportunity. And we think the personalized approach is the right approach in this space. And that\u2019s now being validated by the major key opinion leaders and by the data that we\u2019re seeing come out. So of course, there\u2019s going to be competition going in \u2013 coming in when you have a market of this size. But our plan is to win. And we think we\u2019re putting in place the right strategy now where we\u2019re combining significant focus on data generation, doing the right clinical trials, expanding into multiple indications, making relationships with key opinion leaders and societies and then building out that commercial presence. And we are excited about some of the early indications that we see. We have outlined before the benefits of the personalized approach versus the static panel and sort of tumor-naive approach. And so I won\u2019t go into that, again, other than to say some of the data that we\u2019ve seen coming out with other tumor-naive products, where they are doing monitoring, I think, is not as good as what we\u2019re seeing now with Signatera. Solomon, anything to add?\nPuneet Souda: Okay.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. I will just say our vision is that in this decade, MRD testing serially will become standard of care across solid tumors, the same way people think about a CT scan today. And that will come out over time as we generate more and more data, validating the use of the product. But in terms of whether tumor-informed method is going to become the gold standard, I think we\u2019re basically there at this point. I mean using information from the tumor and from the germline DNA, which is also really important, essentially allows us to cheat, right? I mean we know what we\u2019re looking for in the blood. And that just allows us to achieve a much higher performance with sensitivity and specificity, and that\u2019s just being replicated over and over again.\nPuneet Souda: Great. Alright. Thank you, guys.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thank you, Puneet.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on a really impressive quarter. I guess what was the volume growth just at the core women\u2019s health franchise in the quarter? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much the underlying growth trends are accelerating in that business? And what you think the major driver of that acceleration is? Just given the timing of ACOG, I\u2019d assume that didn\u2019t have a huge impact on the third quarter. So just curious what\u2019s driving that?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we\u2019re actually seeing really an impressive growth, I think, both in the core women\u2019s health business and then also in the early stages of launching in oncology and then in the organ health business. So I\u2019m not going to break out the specifics of each at this point, but I\u2019ll describe some of the dynamics. So in women\u2019s health, there is a couple of things driving growth. There is, I think, COVID underpinning this transition from doing procedures in the office, moving to a simpler solution of just doing blood draws rather than having to do ultrasounds or diagnostic procedures. And that\u2019s now being \u2013 that transition is now being amplified by the payer changes that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the year. Aetna, I think, earlier, maybe in Q2, was pretty quick to announce coverage for average-risk, and now we\u2019re starting to see Centene and Humana. And then we saw the big ACOG, SMFM guideline. So when we go back and we look at the percentage of our business that\u2019s average-risk or high-risk, we\u2019re seeing this kind of this slow tick-up and then an acceleration toward average-risk. And I think that, that\u2019s evident that more and more physicians are starting to adopt and met some of these payer policies and society statements are making an impact. Now in addition to that, we have competitive takeaways where we\u2019re constantly winning business and adding new customers to the fold. So we look every month at how many new customers we\u2019ve won. And we look at the growth from those new customers, and we look at the growth from our existing customers, and we look at our lost accounts. And what we\u2019re just seeing right now is we\u2019re winning customers faster than we have. Our account retention rates are at a peak level. We\u2019re losing very few customers. And we are seeing same-store sales and expansion into average-risk driving that base of growth. So we\u2019re firing on all cylinders there. And again, I think a lot of it is just \u2013 we are focused really on improving NIPT and really on improving carrier screening and delivering awesome user experience, tons of new data, tons of new features. And we\u2019re really making investments in making the women\u2019s health franchise the leading franchise, and we\u2019re seeing some of that, I think, play out competitively now. Some of the things we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years to put ourselves in a position to win are playing out. And I also didn\u2019t \u2013 I guess we\u2019d mentioned it briefly on the call, but we\u2019re also tracking the women\u2019s health business towards cash flow breakeven. And that\u2019s been a goal of ours. And now we\u2019ve gotten the COGS down and continue to do it. And that\u2019s been a goal of ours. And now we\u2019ve gotten the COGS down and continue to grind on that ASP and have relatively stable operating expenses. So while we\u2019re winning and making investments and improving the product, we\u2019re actually running toward breakeven. We\u2019re going to hit that in \u2013 somewhere in mid-2021, which is awesome. Then when you look at organ health and oncology, those are both at very earlier \u2013 obviously much earlier stages. And there, we have certain ramp expectations that we want to hit. And we are looking at the volume basically every day and every week. And we are looking at what sales reps are delivering, what customers are sending, fluctuation patterns, if they are already within those customers, if there is reps that are not performing or are performing. And we tune that up the same way that we have always done. And we have a good formula that, I think, works. And so we are pleased with the ramp that we\u2019re seeing there, but it is very early stage. Although for this quarter, some of the revenue impact that you are seeing is from that \u2013 those new businesses. And this is really, I think, the first quarter, where it\u2019s had a nice impact, which is why we have highlighted it.\nCatherine Schulte: Alright, great. Super helpful commentary. And then is the Foundation partnership still on track to launch the pharma companies this year? And is that offering something that you\u2019re already discussing with potential pharma partners, such that once you are ready to launch, there could be some pent-up demand there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So the partnership with Foundation\u2019s going very well. They are a great partner. We really have a ton of respect for their team, both commercially at the executive level and their scientific team. And so it\u2019s been really a pleasure to be partner with them. We \u2013 what we\u2019ve said is that there\u2019ll be a sort of a pilot launch to pharma and discussions with pharma starting this year. And that\u2019s actually ongoing right now. And those discussions have been very positive. And we\u2019ll be moving towards a more kind of a hard launch at some point later in the future and kind of later in 2021. But the initial interest has been very positive, and everything is on track. And there are deals that are being signed right now.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay, got it. And if I could sneak one more in on carrier screening, I think back in September, you had Evidence Street come out with a positive recommendation for expanded carrier screening. As we think about the percent of volumes that get paid today on the expanded carrier screening side, I guess, what\u2019s the revenue opportunity if those were to get fully reimbursed?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I think there is \u2013 the opportunity there is really twofold. I think one is on pricing, and then the other is just on expanded coverage. And I don\u2019t have that kind of broken out right now to go through in detail, but there are certainly some payers where putting that formal policy in place, I think, would help us significantly. And if you look at the Medicare rate for broader panels, I think there is an opportunity for us to improve the ASP there. So it\u2019s something that we are excited about.\nCatherine Schulte: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Max Masucci with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nMax Masucci: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and great quarter. First one for Mike, it is great to see the raised guidance. Can you just walk us through some of the embedded assumptions just for COVID-19 resurgence, how quickly you can get paid following several commercial payer policy updates? And then any early volume tailwinds just related to an increased willingness to order NIPT following ACOG\u2019s update? That would be great.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Thanks. So we gave a range for the rest of the year, which is really a Q4 guide. And the reason why we gave a range is because, as you pointed out, there are some variables there that \u2013 there is potential for some volatility. I mean I will tell you that the underlying trends in the business so far in the quarter are quite strong, and we are feeling very comfortable with what we\u2019re seeing so far. And frankly, the guide itself implies continued sequential growth in the business over and above this very strong Q3 that we had. So I think the baseline expectation is that the trends in the business that we are seeing so far this year remain stable. And then the top end gives basically some room for incremental acceleration beyond here, and the bottom end gives some room for there to be a little bit of lumpiness in the volumes or the case counts to \u2013 on COVID to perhaps slow us a little bit with the holidays and things like that. So I think the baseline is \u2013 trends stable, and we are feeling very good at where we\u2019re at.\nMax Masucci: Great. And then in May, you announced a settlement with your \u2013 the large sequencing provider should set you up for COGS improvements, I believe, in October and beyond. So can you just highlight what you consider the biggest needle mover in that settlement? If you are seeing any impact and just how this plays into your expectations for gross margins?\nMichael Brophy: It\u2019s not going to be something that really impacts the 2020 guide. I think that\u2019s something that \u2013 again, I mean, very favorable settlement. Great to get that behind us and it\u2019s something that, I think, can generate savings for us as we grow volumes. So I think it\u2019s just kind of a linear tailwind as volumes grow the per unit COGS will continue to benefit us. And I think that, that will be a tailwind over a couple of year time frame.\nMax Masucci: Great, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.\nAlex Nowak: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. You have had Signatera in the market for a few months. Sounds like the launch is going well there, just can you explain what the sales process is like to get a new doctor sign up? Is it rather complex or is the sales team finding that Signatera gets bolted on and trialed with a CEA test relatively easy And maybe just expand on how is the test being used so far in the first couple of months? Is it just a straight addition to CEA? Is it ordered alongside a CT scan or is it confirming another sign of a recurrence just any thoughts there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So appreciate the question. I think the sales strategy is really similar to just other sort of diagnostic products. I mean we have the team. They are convincing a physician to trial it out. They are \u2013 you talk to the nursing staff. They fill out the form or they order online. They place the order. We draw the blood. They are \u2013 we are getting the tissue from the pathology lab. That\u2019s a process that, in the first couple of weeks, really, couple of months, I would say, when we were \u2013 back when we were in the pilot mode, we had to kind of work through. But that\u2019s all resolved at this point, and that\u2019s working like clockwork. And the providers are very comfortable with this sort of releasing tissue. It\u2019s something that they do all the time for Genomic Health or Foundation Medicine in any of these other tests. So it\u2019s pretty straightforward. We are seeing use cases vary from this MRD time point, somebody who\u2019s just entering into that adjuvant window, and the physician wants to make a decision about adjuvant treatment or they want to inform the adjuvant treatment, we are seeing a lot of use there as we thought we would. And multiple time points, so we are tracking how many time points we are getting and so forth. And it\u2019s sort of tracking roughly in line with what we thought we would expect. And then there is actually some patients that are actually coming into the fold post the adjuvant window. So these are people that are \u2013 we like to think about it as the backlog from the account or the prevalent population that had previously been diagnosed. They previously had surgery. They probably may or may not have received adjuvant chemo, and now they are in remission. And we\u2019re seeing a good chunk of patients that come in and enter the protocol at that time point. So the doctor sees value even though they are in remission of going and having us run the exome, design to personalized primers and then start monitoring. So it\u2019s a little bit of a mix of those. I think we are also seeing usage in other GI cancers. And then we are \u2013 although not all of it\u2019s reimbursed, we\u2019re accepting tissue \u2013 we\u2019re accepting samples on a limited basis in other cancer types as well. There\u2019s been a couple of pretty good early-stage clinical experience posters out there at ESMO and then at ASCO, we\u2019d be happy to kind of shoot out to you as well, that highlight some of the initial experience with a couple of the top academic centers, but a little bit of both MRD and recurrence monitoring exactly as we had expected.\nAlex Nowak: That\u2019s great. Very helpful. And then we have seen some big news here with early cancer screening with the background of some others. Not to take away from the huge opportunity in MRD and recurrence, but I think Natera knows cell-free DNA better than anyone. Can you morph that Signatera technology into an early cancer screen? And perhaps the better question is, would you want to go after this market?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So obviously, we have been aware of what is going on in the space. And we \u2013 at this point, we\u2019re really staying focused on this MRD recurrence monitoring, therapy effectiveness. But I do think that expanding into other opportunities is something that would make sense for us to do and to leverage our commercial team. I think that by nature of it, Signatera technology is not something that can be used for early detection. Tumor-informed requires one to have been diagnosed previously. But certainly, we have, as you mentioned, a large expertise in cell-free DNA, and we have a very big team. And if we wanted to look at things like early detection, we would have the right team in place to be able to do that. But again, it\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s not our main focus right now. We are pretty laser-focused on this enormous opportunity ahead of us in the MRD space and getting our share of these 2 million tests per year that we think will already be reimbursed, and then expanding into that $18 billion TAM.\nAlex Nowak: Yes, understood. And then just last question. Can you expand on what the ACOG guideline does here for Medicaid from both a pricing standpoint, a coverage and a usage among state to state, just any thoughts there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, yes. So I think we have shown on one of the slides. So the state Medicaid programs have now doubled the number that we\u2019re offering at average-risk NIPT. That was really low before, it\u2019s almost nonexistent, and now we\u2019re seeing that ramp up. So I think that\u2019s a good sign because a good portion of pregnancies in the U.S. today are covered by Medicaid. And I think there\u2019s a path to reimbursement there. We think that guideline will unlock both additional reimbursement and additional usage. NIPT in the average-risk setting today is only about 25% penetrated. So there\u2019s a lot of room to run there. And we are going to be riding that wave of expansion, and that includes both in the commercial covered lives and also in the Medicaid business.\nAlex Nowak: I understand. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Alright. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with BTIG. Your line is open.\nMark Massaro: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask a question similar to Alex\u2019s, which is your technology platform for years, has been quite versatile, starting in NIPT, transplant, cancer. I guess my question is from a technological perspective, is there a tweak you would have to make from your tumor-informed strategy to enable asymptomatic cancer screening? It\u2019s more of a technical question than it is any type of other question.\nSteve Chapman: Well, I think the \u2013 I will make some comments, and then Solomon, feel free to jump in. I think with asymptomatic screening, you have to know what you are looking for, right? And I think \u2013 I guess with our technology, we speak with the tumor. We find clonal variants, and then we design multiplex PCR assays to those specific variants. So when we are not able to sequence the tumor tissue, we don\u2019t know what to go look for. Now are there other markers or other areas of genes or certain methylation markers that we could go out and look for? Yes, and I think, we are aware of different techniques that are out there. Our core Signatera opportunity would not \u2013 or our core Signatera technology would not just put over, but there are ways that we could be successful in that early detection space. Solomon, do you want to add any comments there?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. I think there is sort of a two part answer here. So if you are doing early screening in a patient who is asymptomatic, the smart set here in the industry is taking multiple approaches to that, right? Folks are adding proteomics or they are adding methylation or they are adding other capabilities that improve detection, which you can achieve \u2013 you cannot achieve with just looking for DNA mutations alone. And so you have to do that because you don\u2019t have any other way to inform your test, right? So Natera does have a lot of the tools, if we decided to make a move in that direction, to be able to compete. And we have been actually spending a good amount of time investigating some of the other technologies. And we think we have a good handle on the pros and cons there. That being said, there\u2019s such an enormous opportunity right now with building out the MRD and monitoring market. We think we\u2019ve got a great leadership position there. And looking back to a question that was asked previously about whether the tumor-informed method is going to be the one that wins out. In this case, if you have got a patient with cancer, the tumor is accessible. It\u2019s \u2013 at this point with the data we presented, it would be hard to convince a patient not to use that information in diagnosing whether that cancer is gone or whether the treatment is working in an MRD or monitoring setting. So we\u2019re focused on that $18 billion TAM, and we think we\u2019re in a great position to succeed.\nMark Massaro: Yes, super helpful. Microdeletions is a huge opportunity for you. So it looks like the SMART study will read out at the end of January. Then I believe you\u2019re expecting a publication. How soon do you think that publication might hit? Is that maybe Q1 of next year? And then when I look at your numbers, if you\u2019re doing 100,000 microdels a quarter, 400,000 times, even $400 ASP, would get you to an incremental $160 million a year. Am I crazy to think that, that is your possible run rate when revenue trickles in? And related to that, I believe the AMA awarded you guys $802 a few years ago for microdel. So can you just help us think about your pricing for microdels?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. That is exactly right. I mean we\u2019re doing now over 100,000 microdeletion tests per quarter. We\u2019ve put into work \u2013 we sponsored a 5-year prospective multisite study of 20,000 patients. It will never be repeated. It\u2019s the gold standard in NIPT and the gold standard in microdeletions. The results have been unblinded. We have looked at them. We think they are strong enough to change society guidelines and to drive payer coverage. We have gotten a price of roughly $800 from Medicare on the clinical lab fee schedule. And if we got even a fraction of that, on average, it would be hundreds of millions of dollars to the bottom line of the business. So we are in a really, I think, incredible position if we can execute on getting that coverage because we don\u2019t really have to grow any additional tests. We just have to get paid for the tests that we\u2019re already doing. And the usual thing that drives coverage is studies \u2013 clinical data and studies. And we\u2019ve done it now. We did the work, and it\u2019s reading out at SMFM. So this is \u2013 this could be a just really incredible opportunity for us that, frankly, we haven\u2019t really spent a lot of time talking about just because it\u2019s been going on for so long and we have so many other awesome things happening within the business, but it\u2019s an enormous opportunity.\nMark Massaro: Yes. And then just for housekeeping, do you expect a publication soon after the SMFM annual meeting? And do you expect commercial payers to evaluate this and maybe come on some time in 2021?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So the publication will be in first half of 2021. It could be shortly after SMFM or maybe slightly after. But I think the data is going to be out there. The main \u2013 I think, the folks that are the key drivers of the decision-making within the societies are the same people that are involved in the paper, and they\u2019ve seen the results. And all I can say is that we think it\u2019s data that is strong enough to change society guidelines. And if you look at commercial payers, the only thing they really care about is society guidelines. So I think we\u2019ve shot our shot here, and this is probably the best possible outcome we could get as far as setting up to get coverage. I mean a 20,000-patient prospective multisite trial collected over 5 years with genetic outcomes has never \u2013 nothing even close to this has ever been done before. And to have the results come out and have them be strong, I think, will be a very significant readout. And the folks that are driving the society guidelines are the ones that are involved and around the fringes of \u2013 around a group of people that are involved in the study. So it\u2019s a great setup. It could \u2013 it obviously takes time once society guidelines change to have that revenue come through. You need to have the paper published, and it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But I think it is something that will be impacting us in the future. We just can\u2019t say exactly what the time line is going to be.\nMark Massaro: Excellent. If I can ask one last one. So it sounds like you are sitting on pretty good data for breast and bladder. Have you seen that data yet? You\u2019ve called it very compelling. So I assume you have seen it. But when that data reads out at ESMO and San Antonio, is it reasonable for us to think that you could potentially announce Signatera expanding to both breast and bladder on a standalone basis?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. We think the data that we will be reading out is extremely compelling and is of the quality that could drive additional reimbursement decisions. And we think the way the current draft coverage decision reads would allow us to submit this and get coverage. Now we have to have the decision go to final, and that\u2019s not going to happen until some midpoint of next year roughly or something in that range. But certainly, these are 2 areas that we will be able to pursue based on the strength of the data.\nMark Massaro: Thanks very much guys.\nSteve Chapman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. The next slide should look familiar. This is the same pathway to reimbursement that we started presenting when we first received the draft local coverage decision last year in colorectal cancer. As a reminder, there are roughly 145,000 patients in the U.S. diagnosed every year with colorectal cancer, and about two-thirds of them have Stage 2 or Stage 3 disease. So with the repeat testing described in the Medicare coverage policy, this would imply roughly 1 million tests per year as a total addressable market. As we expected, we now have the final coverage decision for this indication from Medicare, which went into effect on October 18. We are continuing to work with CMS to finalize pricing, and we are nearing the finish line. The process for pricing is company- and assay-specific, and the final pricing will not be publicly posted by the agency. So for competitive reasons, we do not plan to disclose final pricing when it is completed. We think we have a good sense, however, on where we are likely to land. And we are pleased that the pricing is likely to be consistent with what other companies are receiving for MRD testing in oncology. We expect to be able to bill for patient volumes starting as of the October 18 effective date. As a result, we are now moving into the formal commercial launch phase for Signatera in the clinical setting for colorectal cancer, and we plan to build on the momentum we've seen in the pre-launch phase. As Steve mentioned, we are also significantly ahead of schedule with our immunotherapy response monitoring indication that was just introduced on our last earnings call in Q2. More than 200,000 patients are estimated to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors every year across a range of cancer types, and that number is growing with every successful new pharma trial. While immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care in many ways, it is expensive, and the majority of patients do not respond to this type of treatment. One particular challenge is how to determine whether the treatment is working after it has been initiated and when it may be appropriate to discontinue or switch treatment strategies. For example, if a patient is not responding to treatment, you would expect the tumor to get larger over time on a scan. However, up to 1 in 10 immunotherapy-treated patients see their tumor get bigger on a scan before it gets smaller because it's being filled with lymphocytes and swelling up under attack from the immune system. With a CT scan, this swelling looks like disease progression, which is why it's called pseudo-progression. As a result of these types of uncertainties, as illustrated in the graphic, current treatment guidelines for immunotherapy suggest that physicians continue treating beyond progression until they see confirmation of progression in a follow-up scan, approximately 6 to 12 weeks later. This extra treatment can significantly delay sick patients from switching to other available lines of therapy that may be more effective or it can also result in premature discontinuation for a patient who may actually be responding to the treatment. Based on the data that we published just this summer in Nature Cancer, we think a serial testing protocol with Signatera could help improve this picture, setting a baseline ctDNA measurement before treatment and then following up regularly in conjunction with imaging to help identify true disease progression earlier and to help identify exceptional responders who have achieved ctDNA clearance and who may be eligible for a drug holiday. So if you assume about 4 Signatera tests per year for over 200,000 patients, we think the addressable market for Signatera in this indication could exceed 800,000 tests per year, as we described in August. The next slide summarizes the favorable draft local coverage decision that we received in response to our application to Medicare in IO monitoring. We submitted the dossier for reimbursement to Medicare this summer, just after we published the Nature Cancer publication. And we received the draft LCD ahead of schedule in September. And we were very pleased that Medicare proposed coverage for IO monitoring across solid tumor types based on the strength of our data. We now expect to get final coverage and pricing in 2021, previously, we had not planned to get there until 2022. I also want to give a quick example of the type of work we are doing with pharmaceutical companies. This slide describes the DARE study, where we are working with Pfizer. In this study, Signatera will be used for patient selection and ongoing monitoring in early-stage, ER-positive breast cancer. Patients who test MRD-positive by Signatera will be randomized into an active arm in which they get palbociclib plus fulvestrant or into a control arm, where they get the standard-of-care endocrine therapy. If studies like these are successful, it would pave the way for Signatera usage in the large early-stage breast cancer recurrence monitoring market. Pharma demand has been growing rapidly for us. We continue to win business from new customers, and our repeat business from our largest pharma clients is continuing to grow, consistent with trends we described in August. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we look forward to Signatera data being presented in three different conferences before the end of this year, including new breast cancer data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer meeting in December and new bladder cancer data in an oral presentation at ESMO IO, also in December. These data will be really novel and will contribute meaningfully to the data leadership position we have developed in MRD. Now, let me hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? I think that was a great answer. I will just add that we have been really pleased to partner with Medicare on this. And they've really been supportive of the pan-cancer nature of the product, which is what you're seeing with the new draft LCD. So we're excited about the future here. Yes. I will just say our vision is that in this decade, MRD testing serially will become standard of care across solid tumors, the same way people think about a CT scan today. And that will come out over time as we generate more and more data, validating the use of the product. But in terms of whether tumor-informed method is going to become the gold standard, I think we're basically there at this point. I mean using information from the tumor and from the germline DNA, which is also really important, essentially allows us to cheat, right? I mean we know what we're looking for in the blood. And that just allows us to achieve a much higher performance with sensitivity and specificity, and that's just being replicated over and over again. Yes. I think there is sort of a two part answer here. So if you are doing early screening in a patient who is asymptomatic, the smart set here in the industry is taking multiple approaches to that, right? Folks are adding proteomics or they are adding methylation or they are adding other capabilities that improve detection, which you can achieve \u2013 you cannot achieve with just looking for DNA mutations alone. And so you have to do that because you don't have any other way to inform your test, right? So Natera does have a lot of the tools, if we decided to make a move in that direction, to be able to compete. And we have been actually spending a good amount of time investigating some of the other technologies. And we think we have a good handle on the pros and cons there. That being said, there's such an enormous opportunity right now with building out the MRD and monitoring market. We think we've got a great leadership position there. And looking back to a question that was asked previously about whether the tumor-informed method is going to be the one that wins out. In this case, if you have got a patient with cancer, the tumor is accessible. It's \u2013 at this point with the data we presented, it would be hard to convince a patient not to use that information in diagnosing whether that cancer is gone or whether the treatment is working in an MRD or monitoring setting. So we're focused on that $18 billion TAM, and we think we're in a great position to succeed."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let's get into the highlights. Q3 was another very strong quarter for Natera. The work we've been doing for the last 5 years has really started to deliver results. I will just hit the high points on this slide and then get into more detail on each of these topics on the call. In Q3, we processed 262,000 tests, which represents 31% growth versus last year and 12% versus the second quarter of this year. This is a record quarter in several respects. For example, this is the best sequential quarterly growth we've seen in Q3 since 2015, when the business was a small fraction of the size we are today. We generated revenues of $98.1 million, which is again a record and is up 13% from Q2 2020 and 26% from Q3 2019. This revenue growth was largely driven by product revenues, which was up 39% year-on-year. As most of you saw, after years of effort, we were very pleased to see a position statement from ACOG and SMFM supporting NIPT in all pregnancies. The statement included a table highlighting the superior performance of NIPT, and specifically, highlighted unique aspects of the SNP-based technology, including the detection of triploidy and zygosity in twin pregnancies. We have already seen a significant amount of momentum among payers adding average-risk NIPT to their coverage policies, and we could see significant additions to that list in the near term. This development aligns nicely with the timing of the completion of the SMART trial. The SMART trial is a prospective 20,000-patient multisite clinical trial with newborn genetic outcomes, and that has taken 5 years to run. We think a study of this magnitude and scale will never be repeated, and therefore, could become the gold standard in NIPT for the foreseeable future. The data has been unblinded to us and to the investigators in the trial. And we believe the results have the potential to further drive market share in NIPT and may unlock guidelines on reimbursement for microdeletions, which is already more than 100,000 units per quarter for Natera. We expect the data to be presented at the SMFM conference early next year. We have continued to make excellent progress in the transplant space. We executed our full commercial launch this summer after securing a final reimbursement in May, and we have continued to develop compelling data on our Prospera test. In Q3, we published a clinical utility study, and we announced a unique program highlighting the overlap of cancer and transplantation. We have recently made significant strides in our oncology business as well. We received a positive final coverage decision from Medicare for Signatera in Stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer and we received another draft local coverage decision for our immunotherapy monitoring indication we just introduced on the August earnings call. Together, these indications represent nearly 2 million Signatera tests per year. Additionally, we continue to see growth in our pharma business. For example, we are excited to announce a trial with Pfizer and another with Novartis, where Signatera was selected to evaluate patients receiving CDK4/6 therapy in early-stage breast cancer. If successful, we expect that positive data from these and other trials would continue to expand the addressable market for Signatera. Finally, we continue to build on our leadership position in published data. We expect to present four posters at the SITC conference in November, followed by significant new data in an oral presentation at the ESMO IO conference, with two spotlight poster presentations at San Antonio Breast in December as well. These datasets have all been submitted to top journals for publication next year. Based on the success we have had in Q3, we're excited today to significantly raise our 2020 revenue guidance. Mike will get into the specific details of that at the end of the call. Okay. Now let's get into some of the business trends. The next slide shows our volume progression over time and highlights a large acceleration in volumes we saw in Q3. This was a blowout quarter for us. We are pleased with the initial volumes in organ health and in the pre-launch phase of Signatera. Those launches are both on track and doing very well. The bulk of this performance comes from the core reproductive health business hitting on all cylinders. Post-ACOG, we are seeing an uptick in accounts ordering average-risk NIPT, and we have continued to benefit from closing new customers as well. Also, as you would expect, when the clinic starts ordering Panorama from us, we have an opportunity to educate the practice on our carrier screening offering, which serves to amplify the effect of these trends in our business. The next slide shows our total revenue progression, and a lot of the same trends are at work here. In addition to accelerating top line revenue, as you can see, product revenue growth compared to Q3 of last year was also very strong. Q3 saw revenue contributions from our new businesses as well. As I said in the introduction, this is the time we've really been working for over the past 5 years, where the success that we've had in organ health and oncology has now started to contribute to revenues. We're not breaking out the new businesses for competitive reasons here, but it's exciting to see some of the green shoots in these very large markets. The next slide is our standard average selling price per unit and blended COGS comparison. On the ASPs, you can see again the business is going very well. We have continued to grind upward in the women's health business, and we're starting to see some of the benefits of average-risk reimbursement coming in. And as I mentioned, we had a small but noticeable contribution from the new business units as well. We are pleased to see blended COGS dip back down again in Q3 as we got some scale benefits on infrastructure investments we made in Q1 and Q2, like expanding our lab footprint in Austin. This chart was historically a great metric for tracking our path to profitability in the women's health business. Given our volume growth, ASP and COGS execution, we now see a clear line of sight to reaching cash flow breakeven in the women's health business in the first half of 2021, which is a major achievement for Natera. It's gratifying to see the key pieces of our long-standing plan come together like this. Now that the product mix is shifting a bit, this blended ASP and COGS approach is going to lose some relevance as a way to track our progress in women's health. For example, even though we keep making progress on NIPT and carrier screening COGS per unit, we expect blended COGS to move up in Q4 because we are going to be running a lot more exomes for the first time point in Signatera patients. We'll continue to talk about ASP and COGS, and we will comment on how it's going in women's health, but we will be moving away from these blended metrics. Okay, next slide. Speaking of average-risk NIPT, I wanted to spend another minute on some of you \u2013 for some of you that might be newer to Natera. So this next slide shows the practice bulletin that came out in August. This statement from ACOG and SMFM supports aneuploidy screening in all patients regardless of maternal age or baseline risk and highlights, for the first time that NIPT can be performed in twin pregnancies. The bulletin also highlights unique aspects of SNP-based technology, including the detection of triploidy, use as early as 9 weeks and the ability to assess zygosity in individual fetal fraction when testing twins. As the only SNP-based NIPT available today, these advantages are unique to Natera and help us differentiate in the market. As a reminder, the U.S. market for NIPT consists of about 4 million to 5 million pregnancies per year and is very underpenetrated in the average-risk setting, which makes up 80% of those pregnancies. So we still have a significant room to run in the NIPT space. We think the ACOG statement is already having a positive impact on NIPT volumes, and we are seeing momentum with payers changing coverage policies for both average-risk and twin pregnancies. The next slide shows some of the progress with payers in more detail. The acceleration we've seen in 2020 is really incredible, and it's picked up even more since the ACOG bulletin. Notably, we were very pleased to recently see payers like Humana and Centene join the majority of payers covering NIPT for all women. Payers with positive coverage policies now in place comprise more than 200 million covered lives. There are still some notable exceptions, of course, like UnitedHealthcare, but it's been important to see a wave of very large and prominent payers quickly changing their coverage policies post the ACOG. In addition to the average-risk changes, some new policies also now include coverage for twin pregnancies as well, which provides additional upside for Natera. Now moving on to organ health, as I mentioned, we executed our full commercial launch of Prospera in Q2 of 2020. We've been pleased with our performance, thus far, and have continued to make meaningful relationships with top key opinion leaders in key centers. In Q3, we published new data showing the clinical utility of Prospera. The study concluded that practicing nephrologists who used the Prospera test detected more cases of rejection and made better clinical decisions than physicians in the control group. The study evaluated kidney transplant patients at typical scenarios seen in routine practice. We think continued data generation is important for the overall donor-derived cell-free DNA market, and we are very pleased with how this study read out. In addition, in Q3, we announced an expansive program to improve care for organ transplant patients with a history of cancer. The goal of this program is to understand how Signatera and Prospera can be used together to improve clinical decision-making and respond to the unmet medical needs within these communities. We look forward to giving further updates on our progress in the future. Now I would like to hand the call over to Solomon to cover some of the recent highlights in oncology. Solomon? Yes, thank you for asking that question. I really appreciate it. So I would say, first, we are super excited about the final LCD that we have just received for colorectal, which is an enormous market, over 1 million patients per year in Stage 2 and 3 and there is an opportunity to expand that further, for example with some advanced colorectal cancer patients on the oligometastatic stage that we published this summer at the ESMO conference. So we look forward to getting that under coverage and expanding that indication. For IO monitoring, the initial coverage that we submitted just for that IO monitoring indication is an additional 800,000 patients, so again, like massive expansion of the market. There is an opportunity for us to expand it further into other tumor types even beyond IO monitoring. And we think that, again, we're well positioned to take advantage of that. The most important thing is generating data. And as you've seen, we \u2013 now we have 5 or 6 marquee peer-reviewed publications. And we have two more very significant datasets that are, I would say, on the order of magnitude of our Nature Cancer publication that are going to be reading out initially at some of the conferences later this year and then published in the first half of next year. So we do have a path to expand to other cancer types. And that's how we really tap into that $18 billion TAM. So getting the data is super important, and that's an area where we now have a lead with the publications that we've put out. And I think we said before, we have 25 additional biobanks that are in-house that we are going to be running and publishing additional data on over time, and then at least two of them that we think will be very significant and published in the near future. Yes. So what we said before is that we \u2013 at the beginning of the year, we sort of hired up 25 oncology sales reps that would help us in that kind of pre-launch phase. And then after we fully commercialize, we'd expand that over time. And I think now that we've gotten the final coverage decision, it puts us in a position to be able to add more sales reps. We have incrementally added a few over time. But we're also making investments in other areas: product life cycle; clinical data generation; clinical trials, like you have seen with the big prospective BESPOKE registry study that we've announced; society and KOL relationships. So there is a lot of investments across the business and across each functional area going into oncology that go well beyond just sales. Certainly, our strategy is to make relationships with top academic centers and key opinion leaders, and then in addition, cover the community oncology practices. And we are looking to be in a position to execute that and continue on the success that we've had. The early evidence is looking very, very good. We are pleased with how we are doing. And I think we are executing on all cylinders on the clinical launch. Yes. So I will make a couple of comments. And then Mike, maybe you can jump in. Yes, so if you go back and you look at any other specialty diagnostic company that has launched a novel product, back \u2013 when Foundation Medicine was launching the conference on genomic profiling or Guardant launching liquid biopsy, there's a pretty kind of similar cadence of what the penetration looks like over the first couple of years. And you have to go out and really train the physicians on a novel concept and a novel product, and that doesn't flip on like a light switch overnight. A lot of times, they want to trial it out. They want to see what the KOLs in the area are doing. They want to see some data. So there is a lot of effort that goes into building the market and getting the ramp. We published some great initial commercial experience data. If you go back and look at what was available at ASCO or the summer at ESMO, you can see some of the engagement we have in the commercial \u2013 in the early pre-commercial launch with some of the top key opinion leaders. So we're excited about how things are going. We think we're going to be kind of right in there with the ramps of some of these extremely successful companies like Guardant and Foundation when they went out, and we're expecting to have a kind of similar type of penetration over time to what they've been able to do. And frankly, that's what we're seeing right now. Mike, you want to comment on that? Yes. So that's a great question. And so this is effectively the moment we've all been waiting for on average-risk. I mean, for years, we've been behind the scenes, doing the clinical trials, putting the teams in place, building the user experience capabilities, logistics capabilities to be able to expand in this very large underpenetrated average-risk market. So today, there's 3.2 million pregnancies every year that are average-risk. And despite NIPT now being available for 8 years commercially, that average-risk market is only about 25% penetrated. We believe we have slightly more than 50% of the market share. And we've continued to gain share and grow that business, both from expanding average-risk usage in our existing customer base, and especially, we've seen that actually accelerating in the last month or so, 1.5 months post the guidelines, but also competitive takeaways. And when you look at the unique clinical aspects that Panorama offers for noninvasive prenatal testing and you combine that with the massive data trove that we have that really dwarfs the clinical data than any other NIPT has on the market. Just that package, combined with our seasoned sales team and our extreme focus on user experience, is playing very, very well. And we're seeing a lot of receptivity. And also note that, really, for the first time, we saw ACOG and SMFM actually call out the unique benefits of the SNP-based technology, things like triploidy that none of the other technologies can test for or things like zygosity on twin gestations that none of the other technologies can test for. Now, those are actually now written into the guidelines as advantages of the SNP-based platform. So it's rare that you see that type of thing, but we're super excited that, that's now been incorporated in the guidelines. So we're in a position to continue growing and maintaining our share and riding the wave of NIPT expansion as the market becomes much more penetrated over the next several years. Yes. So we actually have a couple of really fantastic partnerships in Signatera. One, with Foundation Medicine, where they're going to be designing personalized monitoring off of a baseline of FoundationOne CDx. And we think that's a great opportunity for us in both biopharma and the clinical setting, where they are really in a dominant position. And then we've announced our partnership with the Beijing Genomics Institute in China. So BGI is the dominant cell-free DNA and sequencing provider in China. They've done more testing than anybody. They're going to be launching Signatera onto both clinical setting and then also as a pharma service provider. So we've seen with big multinational pharma companies that they want to get their drug on the market in China. And in order for them to get the drug on the market, they have to run trials in China. And that means you have to have a partner on the ground in China. So we think this is an advantage. We've signed very good global pharma trials that include a China arm with BGI, and we look forward to them launching and servicing those trials. So we're ready this year to start servicing those customers. And we think some of the sample flow will really start to ramp up as we go into 2021. Yes. So yes, those are great questions. I think our hypothesis going into the transplant business was that we could compete very well with the incumbents. And I'm pleased with the performance of our team. So we are meeting our plan despite the impact of COVID. We're seeing very strong receptivity, expanding our relationships with many centers and many key opinion leaders. You can see from some of the press releases that we've done around our data that we're generating at conferences that we're working with really the A-list of key opinion leaders. So I'm pleased with how we're doing. We do think that we're going to continue to grow that business as we turn the corner into next year. I think we have a couple of new data points that just read out actually. We announced this summer that we could quantify the background DNA and that could have an impact on the donor-derived cell-free DNA. And then just last week at the ASM conference, we had major key opinion leaders talking about the clinical utility of testing for background DNA. And one really amazing example was that we were able to identify patients, who actually had COVID, who had a 57x background DNA. And that's the type of thing that you can really now only get with the Prospera product. So we're excited about what the future holds. We're bringing our innovation and expertise that we've developed over the years in cell-free DNA to bear in organ transplant to help patients. And we're very pleased with the performance and how we're doing. And I think now you can \u2013 I mean, if you look at our revenue numbers and volume numbers, we blew it out this quarter, right? And some of that revenue increase, like we said, from the first time now, we're really seeing the impact of these new business units. And so we're pleased to see that happening as we thought it would. Yes. So I will make a couple of comments and then maybe Solomon, you can jump in. So first, on other indications and other data sets, I would strongly recommend you tune into the ESMO IO conference and the San Antonio Breast conference because there's going to be some very compelling data there, and we think it \u2013 on the level of the data that we've published in Nature Cancer and some of our other marquee publications. So the key to generating additional opportunities and unlocking additional opportunities is data, and that is an area that we have a very significant leadership. Now with 5 to 6 peer-reviewed publications in top journals and a big trove of additional papers that are going to be reading out over time, we have roughly 25 additional biobanks that are in-house that we're going to be publishing on and reading out over time. And then we have two very significant prospective studies that we'll be reading out this year, and they'll be discussed at these conferences, and then they should be published next year. So I mean we've \u2013 this is just the beginning. Although I want to reiterate, colorectal and IO together make up around 2 million tests per year. If you compare that to some of the other oncology diagnostic opportunities that are out there that are in the range of, say, 400,000 tests per year TAM, I mean, we're talking about orders of magnitude bigger than anything else out there and it's covered, and it's just the beginning. So we are super excited about that. Now on pricing, we are in the process of wrapping things up right now with Medicare. The discussions have been going very well. We expect to have it wrapped, I would say, probably in the next 2 weeks, roughly. And it's exactly sort of in line with where we thought it would be. We've said now on this call, because of the uniqueness of our product and the unique situation of doing recurrent monitoring of cancer patients and the bespoke nature of our test, that we have some unique pricing strategies. And we're not going to actually publicly announce anything because we think it's confidential to us, and we don't want to give our playbook away to all the competitors. But we're very positive about the way things are going. And we should have it wrapped up in the next couple of weeks and then be able to bill retroactively back to that October 18 start point. Solomon, do you have anything to add to that? Yes. So look, we think that this space of MRD and recurrence monitoring and therapy effectiveness monitoring is very large, $18 billion of pan-cancer opportunity. And we think the personalized approach is the right approach in this space. And that's now being validated by the major key opinion leaders and by the data that we're seeing come out. So of course, there's going to be competition going in \u2013 coming in when you have a market of this size. But our plan is to win. And we think we're putting in place the right strategy now where we're combining significant focus on data generation, doing the right clinical trials, expanding into multiple indications, making relationships with key opinion leaders and societies and then building out that commercial presence. And we are excited about some of the early indications that we see. We have outlined before the benefits of the personalized approach versus the static panel and sort of tumor-naive approach. And so I won't go into that, again, other than to say some of the data that we've seen coming out with other tumor-naive products, where they are doing monitoring, I think, is not as good as what we're seeing now with Signatera. Solomon, anything to add? Yes. Thank you, Puneet. Yes. So we're actually seeing really an impressive growth, I think, both in the core women's health business and then also in the early stages of launching in oncology and then in the organ health business. So I'm not going to break out the specifics of each at this point, but I'll describe some of the dynamics. So in women's health, there is a couple of things driving growth. There is, I think, COVID underpinning this transition from doing procedures in the office, moving to a simpler solution of just doing blood draws rather than having to do ultrasounds or diagnostic procedures. And that's now being \u2013 that transition is now being amplified by the payer changes that we've seen over the course of the year. Aetna, I think, earlier, maybe in Q2, was pretty quick to announce coverage for average-risk, and now we're starting to see Centene and Humana. And then we saw the big ACOG, SMFM guideline. So when we go back and we look at the percentage of our business that's average-risk or high-risk, we're seeing this kind of this slow tick-up and then an acceleration toward average-risk. And I think that, that's evident that more and more physicians are starting to adopt and met some of these payer policies and society statements are making an impact. Now in addition to that, we have competitive takeaways where we're constantly winning business and adding new customers to the fold. So we look every month at how many new customers we've won. And we look at the growth from those new customers, and we look at the growth from our existing customers, and we look at our lost accounts. And what we're just seeing right now is we're winning customers faster than we have. Our account retention rates are at a peak level. We're losing very few customers. And we are seeing same-store sales and expansion into average-risk driving that base of growth. So we're firing on all cylinders there. And again, I think a lot of it is just \u2013 we are focused really on improving NIPT and really on improving carrier screening and delivering awesome user experience, tons of new data, tons of new features. And we're really making investments in making the women's health franchise the leading franchise, and we're seeing some of that, I think, play out competitively now. Some of the things we've done over the last couple of years to put ourselves in a position to win are playing out. And I also didn't \u2013 I guess we'd mentioned it briefly on the call, but we're also tracking the women's health business towards cash flow breakeven. And that's been a goal of ours. And now we've gotten the COGS down and continue to do it. And that's been a goal of ours. And now we've gotten the COGS down and continue to grind on that ASP and have relatively stable operating expenses. So while we're winning and making investments and improving the product, we're actually running toward breakeven. We're going to hit that in \u2013 somewhere in mid-2021, which is awesome. Then when you look at organ health and oncology, those are both at very earlier \u2013 obviously much earlier stages. And there, we have certain ramp expectations that we want to hit. And we are looking at the volume basically every day and every week. And we are looking at what sales reps are delivering, what customers are sending, fluctuation patterns, if they are already within those customers, if there is reps that are not performing or are performing. And we tune that up the same way that we have always done. And we have a good formula that, I think, works. And so we are pleased with the ramp that we're seeing there, but it is very early stage. Although for this quarter, some of the revenue impact that you are seeing is from that \u2013 those new businesses. And this is really, I think, the first quarter, where it's had a nice impact, which is why we have highlighted it. Yes. So the partnership with Foundation's going very well. They are a great partner. We really have a ton of respect for their team, both commercially at the executive level and their scientific team. And so it's been really a pleasure to be partner with them. We \u2013 what we've said is that there'll be a sort of a pilot launch to pharma and discussions with pharma starting this year. And that's actually ongoing right now. And those discussions have been very positive. And we'll be moving towards a more kind of a hard launch at some point later in the future and kind of later in 2021. But the initial interest has been very positive, and everything is on track. And there are deals that are being signed right now. Yes. I think there is \u2013 the opportunity there is really twofold. I think one is on pricing, and then the other is just on expanded coverage. And I don't have that kind of broken out right now to go through in detail, but there are certainly some payers where putting that formal policy in place, I think, would help us significantly. And if you look at the Medicare rate for broader panels, I think there is an opportunity for us to improve the ASP there. So it's something that we are excited about. Yes. So appreciate the question. I think the sales strategy is really similar to just other sort of diagnostic products. I mean we have the team. They are convincing a physician to trial it out. They are \u2013 you talk to the nursing staff. They fill out the form or they order online. They place the order. We draw the blood. They are \u2013 we are getting the tissue from the pathology lab. That's a process that, in the first couple of weeks, really, couple of months, I would say, when we were \u2013 back when we were in the pilot mode, we had to kind of work through. But that's all resolved at this point, and that's working like clockwork. And the providers are very comfortable with this sort of releasing tissue. It's something that they do all the time for Genomic Health or Foundation Medicine in any of these other tests. So it's pretty straightforward. We are seeing use cases vary from this MRD time point, somebody who's just entering into that adjuvant window, and the physician wants to make a decision about adjuvant treatment or they want to inform the adjuvant treatment, we are seeing a lot of use there as we thought we would. And multiple time points, so we are tracking how many time points we are getting and so forth. And it's sort of tracking roughly in line with what we thought we would expect. And then there is actually some patients that are actually coming into the fold post the adjuvant window. So these are people that are \u2013 we like to think about it as the backlog from the account or the prevalent population that had previously been diagnosed. They previously had surgery. They probably may or may not have received adjuvant chemo, and now they are in remission. And we're seeing a good chunk of patients that come in and enter the protocol at that time point. So the doctor sees value even though they are in remission of going and having us run the exome, design to personalized primers and then start monitoring. So it's a little bit of a mix of those. I think we are also seeing usage in other GI cancers. And then we are \u2013 although not all of it's reimbursed, we're accepting tissue \u2013 we're accepting samples on a limited basis in other cancer types as well. There's been a couple of pretty good early-stage clinical experience posters out there at ESMO and then at ASCO, we'd be happy to kind of shoot out to you as well, that highlight some of the initial experience with a couple of the top academic centers, but a little bit of both MRD and recurrence monitoring exactly as we had expected. Yes. So obviously, we have been aware of what is going on in the space. And we \u2013 at this point, we're really staying focused on this MRD recurrence monitoring, therapy effectiveness. But I do think that expanding into other opportunities is something that would make sense for us to do and to leverage our commercial team. I think that by nature of it, Signatera technology is not something that can be used for early detection. Tumor-informed requires one to have been diagnosed previously. But certainly, we have, as you mentioned, a large expertise in cell-free DNA, and we have a very big team. And if we wanted to look at things like early detection, we would have the right team in place to be able to do that. But again, it's not \u2013 that's not our main focus right now. We are pretty laser-focused on this enormous opportunity ahead of us in the MRD space and getting our share of these 2 million tests per year that we think will already be reimbursed, and then expanding into that $18 billion TAM. Yes, yes. So I think we have shown on one of the slides. So the state Medicaid programs have now doubled the number that we're offering at average-risk NIPT. That was really low before, it's almost nonexistent, and now we're seeing that ramp up. So I think that's a good sign because a good portion of pregnancies in the U.S. today are covered by Medicaid. And I think there's a path to reimbursement there. We think that guideline will unlock both additional reimbursement and additional usage. NIPT in the average-risk setting today is only about 25% penetrated. So there's a lot of room to run there. And we are going to be riding that wave of expansion, and that includes both in the commercial covered lives and also in the Medicaid business. Alright. Thanks. Well, I think the \u2013 I will make some comments, and then Solomon, feel free to jump in. I think with asymptomatic screening, you have to know what you are looking for, right? And I think \u2013 I guess with our technology, we speak with the tumor. We find clonal variants, and then we design multiplex PCR assays to those specific variants. So when we are not able to sequence the tumor tissue, we don't know what to go look for. Now are there other markers or other areas of genes or certain methylation markers that we could go out and look for? Yes, and I think, we are aware of different techniques that are out there. Our core Signatera opportunity would not \u2013 or our core Signatera technology would not just put over, but there are ways that we could be successful in that early detection space. Solomon, do you want to add any comments there? Yes. That is exactly right. I mean we're doing now over 100,000 microdeletion tests per quarter. We've put into work \u2013 we sponsored a 5-year prospective multisite study of 20,000 patients. It will never be repeated. It's the gold standard in NIPT and the gold standard in microdeletions. The results have been unblinded. We have looked at them. We think they are strong enough to change society guidelines and to drive payer coverage. We have gotten a price of roughly $800 from Medicare on the clinical lab fee schedule. And if we got even a fraction of that, on average, it would be hundreds of millions of dollars to the bottom line of the business. So we are in a really, I think, incredible position if we can execute on getting that coverage because we don't really have to grow any additional tests. We just have to get paid for the tests that we're already doing. And the usual thing that drives coverage is studies \u2013 clinical data and studies. And we've done it now. We did the work, and it's reading out at SMFM. So this is \u2013 this could be a just really incredible opportunity for us that, frankly, we haven't really spent a lot of time talking about just because it's been going on for so long and we have so many other awesome things happening within the business, but it's an enormous opportunity. Yes. So the publication will be in first half of 2021. It could be shortly after SMFM or maybe slightly after. But I think the data is going to be out there. The main \u2013 I think, the folks that are the key drivers of the decision-making within the societies are the same people that are involved in the paper, and they've seen the results. And all I can say is that we think it's data that is strong enough to change society guidelines. And if you look at commercial payers, the only thing they really care about is society guidelines. So I think we've shot our shot here, and this is probably the best possible outcome we could get as far as setting up to get coverage. I mean a 20,000-patient prospective multisite trial collected over 5 years with genetic outcomes has never \u2013 nothing even close to this has ever been done before. And to have the results come out and have them be strong, I think, will be a very significant readout. And the folks that are driving the society guidelines are the ones that are involved and around the fringes of \u2013 around a group of people that are involved in the study. So it's a great setup. It could \u2013 it obviously takes time once society guidelines change to have that revenue come through. You need to have the paper published, and it doesn't happen overnight. But I think it is something that will be impacting us in the future. We just can't say exactly what the time line is going to be. Yes. We think the data that we will be reading out is extremely compelling and is of the quality that could drive additional reimbursement decisions. And we think the way the current draft coverage decision reads would allow us to submit this and get coverage. Now we have to have the decision go to final, and that's not going to happen until some midpoint of next year roughly or something in that range. But certainly, these are 2 areas that we will be able to pursue based on the strength of the data. Thank you."

Q2 was another very strong quarter for Natera. We processed 234,000 tests in the quarter, which was essentially on par with our all-time record Q1 volumes, despite the obvious impacts from COVID-19. We generated $86.5 million in revenues on a 46% gross margin and grew product revenues approximately 24% year-on-year We started enrolling patients in three separate large prospective trials, BESPOKE and IDEA-CIRCULATE for Signatera in colorectal cancer and the proactive trial for Prospera in kidney transplant rejection screening. These are key trials that we believe will extend our leadership position in these areas. I'm sure many of you saw that we have now completed the process to get reimbursed for Prospera. And so far, we are being paid as expected by CMS. We were very pleased to receive the Force of Change Illuminator Award from Leading Women Entrepreneurs, which is an organization that is recognized over 500 outstanding women leaders in innovative companies over the past day. Sheetal Parmar, who leads the Clinical Services and Medical Education teams at Natera and is Cochair of Women of Natera, an employee resource group that supports workplace equality and diversity was also recognized for her individual contributions in Natera\u2019s mission and values. So we just wanted to say thank you and congratulate Sheetal and the women of Natera for their leadership. In our oncology effort, first in IO monitoring. Just this week, we saw the publication of a groundbreaking validation study in Nature Cancer, demonstrating Signatera's ability to monitor tumor response to immunotherapy in 25 different types of solid cancer. Second in colorectal cancer, we presented data at ASCO and ESMO GI that supports the use of Signatera for metastatic colorectal cancer, with a prospective publication to follow. Based on the strong data, I'm very pleased today to announce two new clinic expansion opportunities where we're seeking reimbursement for Signatera, as you can see on this next slide. We think together these new opportunities represent approximately 900,000 additional tests per year, nearly doubling our previous addressable market associated with stage two and three colorectal cancer. So all combined, we think we have a clear path for reimbursement and commercialization in clinical settings that represent roughly 2 million tests per year. In IO monitoring, we have already completed a positive pre-submission meeting and formally submitted our dossier for local coverage decision to Medicare and what would be our second major reimburse clinical indication for Signatera. In metastatic colorectal cancer, we plan to submit this indication to expand the previous colorectal cancer indication soon. Solomon will describe these indications in more detail later in the call. The next slide shows our volume performance by quarter. Each of the last few years we've seen a very large step up in the Q1 volumes over prior years. And then due to seasonal factors that we've described in the past, Q2 volumes are typically just below Q1. In 2019 Q2 volumes pulled back 3% from Q1 2019. This year in 2020, we saw a smaller pullback of about a half percentage point versus our record Q1 2020. This is remarkable, given the scale of the disruption to the economy in Q2. During the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, we immediately saw a drop in our weekly received volumes of about 15% in the last two weeks of March and first few weeks of April. And then we saw weekly volume starts to recover toward Q1 levels, as our existing customers and the accounts we won early in Q1 figured out how to reopen their practices to maintain critical services, like non-invasive prenatal testing. Mike will talk more about the outlook later in the call. But we're feeling good about our existing customers ability to weather COVID-19 surges in the second half of the year. In order to grow, we also need a new - to win new accounts. While I still think it's clearly easier to win new business when a rep has unfettered access to a clinic, we have made good use of our remote tools. And we built and have a number of encouraging customer wins since our last earnings call. So we're monitoring the situation as you'd expect, but we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year. The next slide shows a revenue trajectory over time. I\u2019d note that partner revenue recognition in Q2 of 2019, included $5 million from BGI compared to only about $1.2 million for BGI and Foundation Medicine combined in Q2 of 2020. So the underlying product revenue trends in the business remain very strong, as I mentioned. The next slide is our typical ASP and COGS view, which came in as we had expected, and I think shows our momentum is intact. On the ASP front, we had both headwinds and tailwind in the quarter. As expected, our IVF channel was much more severely impacted than our core channel, as it was initially considered elective, and many centers closed. The products we sell in that IVF channel have a much higher average price per test than the core reproductive health channel. So we suffered a bit from a less favorable product mix. I think that's more of a timing issue. It's likely that a lot of these IVF customers that were put on hold in the spring will find a way to push forward in the next three to four quarters, so the IVF volume I think can swing in our favour when that happens. The main tailwind we had was Aetna, extending their average risk NIPT coverage due to the pandemic. And we just saw over the weekend that they've chosen to extend coverage now to the end of the year, which of course we were very glad to see. So I view this ASP result as more or less status quo, as expected given the factors outlined. One other long term potential benefit to both ASP and average risk adoption is the publication of the SMART study. The study enrollment is now completed, and we expect data to be published and presented around the SMFM conference in roughly six months. As a reminder, SMART is a landmark 20,000 patient multi site prospective clinical trial we've been running for the past five years. We expect multiple papers from the study, one focused on fetal aneuploidy in both average risk and high risk pregnancies, and one focus on microdeletions. The aneuploidy data has been analyzed and the microdeletion data has yet to be released. Although we can't comment on the performance, because this is the largest perspective, average risk aneuploidy and microdeletion trial to be completed, we think SMART could have a positive impact on society guidelines and coverage policies for both indications. We also expect to generate additional demand for Panorama given our leadership in clinical validation data that extends further with the SMART trial completed. I've got largely the same takeaway for COGS per unit in the quarter. We added some redundancy to fortify our lab operations team to make sure we are robust to COVID-19, including the expansion at our Austin lab facility, and we anticipate needing to maintain that redundancy over the next few quarters. Having said that, the new workflow improvements coming out R&D that have caused a step change improvement versus last year performed even better in Q2 than they did in Q1. So we're very confident our plan for COGS below $200 for the reproductive health business is achievable. Now last point getting below $200 for the reproductive health business it's important to note,, as our product mix changes to include new products like Signatera, the average COGS will change as well. So we'll track these overall metrics, but I anticipate giving some separate color in the future on reproductive health COGS. You will recall, the number one goal in the company is to get the reproductive health business to cash flow breakeven. This comes from strategic volume growth, stable ASPs and COGS getting lower. Despite all the impacts from COVID-19, all of the variables that we've just walked through give us the confidence that we are on track to achieve that goal, while we rapidly scale the new business. Just one more check-in second slide on our operational response to COVID. The mobile tools for patients and customers which have been available for years are scaling nicely. We've seen this mobile offering proved to be particularly critical and starting new accounts for Signatera and Prospera, given these patients tend to be you know compromised and also have a critical need to be consistently monitored. I mentioned the Austin lab expansion as well. This was executed smoothly despite the pandemic. The Austin lab gives us critical redundancy to our California lab and offers capacity of more than 2 million tests annually and it should in the future offer additional cost of goods sold efficiencies once at scale. We've also launched a wide array of safety and protective testing protocols for both labs and feel confident we have a good model for consistent operations in this new environment. Okay, now, let me shift the focus to the Transplant business. As I mentioned, we're very pleased to get final reimbursement for Prospera. This slide is the same slide we first presented in 2018. And we're now happy to retire it. As you'll see later in the call, we of course following the same path now for a number of indications and oncology. We've been able to submit claims to Medicare for Prospera and so far received reimbursement consistent with the final pricing of 2841 per test assigned to us by the MolDx program. So we have now executed our commercial launch. We described on our last call the success we had during our pre launch phase for Prospera, in which we demonstrated that we could access a broad swath of the transplant centers. We're still in the early days of the launch. And despite the ongoing pandemic, we continue to feel confident that Prospera can be a significant contributor for the company. As described on the next slide, we've continued to generate data and improve the performance of the test. Given that we have run more than 2 million cell-free DNA tests commercially at Natera, we built up a huge data set that we can query to further refine Prospera's algorithm. This spring, we launched an improvement to the algorithm that identifies patients with elevated background levels of cell-free DNA in their blood. This can provide critical information. For example, we've seen patients affected by COVID-19 can have very elevated levels of background cell-free DNA. Being able to identify elevated levels of background DNA allows us to identify patients who might be at risk of a false negative result, where the donor signal is simply diluted by an extremely elevated background signal. So we presented several case studies on this new technology at ATC this year. And we also announced the launch of a prospective trial, the PEDAL study to externally validate this enhanced algorithm. And we plan to run that study in 500 patients across several major transplant centers. Dr. Brennan from Johns Hopkins and Dr. Bunnapradist from UCLA introduced the study at ATC to great perception. These are two premier physician researchers from two of the largest and most prestigious centers in the world. We're excited to leverage our scientific expertise and our leadership and cell-free DNA to help transplant patients and we look forward to continuing our early success in the second half of the year. Now, let me hand the reins over to Solomon to cover our progress in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. The first slide here summarizes the commercial verticals we are pursuing within oncology. As a reminder, we signed a deal with Foundation Medicine last year to co-develop a test similar to Signatera, which leverages the tumor genomic data identified in a FoundationOne CDx test to design a personalized assay for each patient for serial monitoring of their ctDNA. We continue to think this is an elegant combination of industry-leading technologies from both companies. And we are excited to have the foundation oncology field force out marketing the product to both biopharma and clinical customers. We expect the new test to fit especially well for the immunotherapy response monitoring indication, which I'll discuss in greater detail in a moment. The co-development effort is going well and we remain on track for Foundation Medicine to be engaging with pharma customers this year. Another key partnership for us is with BGI, to bring Signatera technology to China. We remain on track there to get the initial launch in China by the end of this year, and we have already signed deals with leading biopharma that are just waiting for the service to launch. Within our direct commercial effort, demand in our pharma channel has been exceeding our expectations. We are generating new data together with pharma clients at a rapid pace. And the data that we presented at ASCO in collaboration with Genentech was well received. As our pharma clients plan to launch more MRD guided clinical trials, we are continuing to invest. Mike will touch on this further in his guide. We expect more news flow from the pharma channel in the second half of the year, but for today, we want to focus on new developments in our clinical channel. In the direct clinical channel, we have been extremely pleased with the reception we've gotten from the pre-launch phase for Signatera in colorectal cancer. Steve mentioned we started enrolling in the BESPOKE trial and the idea of surgery at trial, and the IDEA-CIRCULATE trial. And the initial uptake and feedback from NCCN centers and other leading institutions has been very positive. With this strong momentum, plus the new opportunity we are pursuing in immunotherapy response monitoring, we're moving forward with commercial expansion plans to ensure full access nationwide. Checking in on our reimbursement path now for the indication in stage two and three colorectal cancer, where we received the draft coverage decision for Medicare. We initially set out a goal to have final reimbursement in the second half of this year, and nothing has changed from that expectation. Now, I'm excited to discuss the two new clinical indications that Steve touched on in his intro, oligometastatic CRC and IO monitoring. I will describe the metastatic CRC opportunity first, which is really an extension of our existing application in colorectal cancer. If you recall, our initial indication was focused on stage two and three CRC, based on validation data we published last year in JAMA Oncology. We have now generated data that shows the validity of Signatera in CRC patients with stage four oligometastatic disease, which represents about 20% to 30% of all stage four CRC patients. In oligometastatic disease there are generally only a few metastatic lesions, usually isolated to the liver, which can be treated with curative intent surgery, plus or minus adjuvant chemotherapy. Many of these patients can be cured with surgery alone, but doctors today do not have good diagnostic tools to determine which patients need adjuvant chemotherapy and the NCCN guidelines are vague on this front. These patients may also benefit from early relapse detection, as the relapse may again be oligometastatic and eligible for local treatment if caught early enough. This is where Signatera can help clarify which patients still have residual disease in their blood after surgery. At the ESMO GI World Congress, back in July, Dr. Stacy Cohen from the University of Washington presented data showing Signatera detected ctDNA prior to surgery in 100% of patients with confirmed oligometastatic disease, and half of patients from the first blood sample taken after surgery still had circulating DNA. This is consistent with what many doctors had expected based on published relapse rates. But now Signatera allows them to get this information in closer to real time when they can make a better decision on chemotherapy after surgery. We have recently had a separate data set from a prospective Phase 2 study accepted for presentation at ESMO in September, which will further bolster the evidence base for this patient population. As Steve described, we look forward to working with Medicare to include this application under the coverage policy. Turning the page now, we have a totally new opportunity for Signatera in immunotherapy response monitoring, or what we like to call IO monitoring for short. Let's start first with the problem statement here, which is pretty different from what we are doing in CRC. More than 200,000 patients are estimated to receive immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment every year across a range of cancer types. And that number is growing with every successful new pharma trial. While immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care in many ways, and brought hope and cure to many. It is expensive, and many experienced immune related adverse events. But still the majority of patients do not respond to this type of treatment, despite the introduction of predictive biomarkers. One particular challenge is how to determine whether the treatment is working after it has been initiated, and when it may be appropriate to discontinue or switch treatment strategies, there are many points of clinical uncertainty during a patient's journey with immunotherapy. But one that we want to highlight here is a phenomenon called pseudoprogression. If a patient is not responding to treatment, you would expect the tumor to get larger on a scan over time. However, up to one in 10 immunotherapy treated patients see their tumors get bigger before it gets smaller, because it's being filled with lymphocytes and swelling up under attack from the immune system. With a CT scan, this swelling looks like a true disease progression, which it's not, hence the term pseudoprogression. Though this phenomenon is not super common, it actually impacts care for most patients. Because everyone with increasing tumor volume on a CT scan hopes that they might be the one in 10. As a result of this uncertainty, current guidelines suggest that physicians continue treating beyond progression, until they see confirmation of progression in a follow up scan, which can be approximately six to 12 weeks later. This extra treatment can significantly delay sick patients from switching to other available lines of therapy that may be more effective or can result in premature withdrawal for a patient who may actually be sensitive to the treatment. And of course during the COVID-19 outbreak getting routine CT scans for these compromised patients is even more challenging. Based on the published evidence, we think a serial testing protocol with Signatera could significantly help improve this picture, setting a baseline ctDNA measurement before treatment and then following up regularly in conjunction with imaging to help identify true disease progression earlier. In addition to ruling out pseudoprogression, serial follow up with Signatera can also identify patients with secondary resistance before it's noted on imaging, helping to decide whether to modify or potentially switch treatment strategies. And it can also identify exceptional responders who clear their ctDNA completely and might be eligible for an early drug holiday. If you assume four Signatera tests per year for over 200,000 patients, we think the addressable market for Signatera in this indication could exceed 800,000 tests annually, as Steve described. So there's a fast growing body of scientific literature that validates the use of ctDNA for this purpose. To highlight a few quotes here from earlier academic studies, and nature reviews article concluded that monitoring of ctDNA levels has now been shown to be a clinically valid method of assessing the early efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. A JAMA Oncology article found that ctDNA profiles can accurately differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression. And an article in Clinical Cancer Research reported these findings provide rationale for use of ctDNA in conjunction with standard imaging to provide an earlier and more comprehensive assessment of immunotherapy efficacy. So the momentum within the clinical community for this indication strong. Now our paper is the first to validate these results using a commercial grade technology. In this perspective, Phase 2 study called INSPIRE published in Nature Cancer on Monday, patients with 25 different types of solid cancer received the Merck drug pembrolizumab and were monitored regularly with both CT scans and personalized ctDNA assessments. At just six weeks into treatment, 42% of those patients showed increasing tumor volume on CT scan and increasing ctDNA, of whom 100% were later confirmed to be non-responsive to the treatment. These patients received on average six extra weeks of treatment that potentially could have been avoided. Signatera also identified 16% of patients who completely clear their ctDNA during treatment. And 100% of those patients survived through the end of the study period, with a median of 25.4 months of follow up beyond the first clearance of their tumor DNA. Based on the strength of this data and early feedback from leading oncologists, we think IO monitoring will have a meaningful impact for patients, doctors and health systems. So we're moving fast now to commercialize. The next slide shows where we are in that process with Medicare. Hopefully, the slide format will look familiar as this is now our third time down the path with the same group at MolDx. We've now had multiple positive pre-submission meetings with MolDx on this topic, and we have formally submitted our dossier for review. If MolDx remains positive on the clinical validity and utility here, the next step could be a draft coverage decision, which we may receive in late 2020, or the first half of 2020. So in summary, the oncology business is progressing rapidly. With that, let me hand the call over to Mike to review the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The next slide here is just a summary set of results for the quarter. Steve, covered volumes, revenues and COGS, but a couple other items to note on the expensive side. When we spoke in May, we described that we were going to take a wait and see approach as it relates to investments across our businesses. Despite the uncertainty around the pandemic, the business has been resilient. So we've expanded our initial investment plans from the start of 2020. In oncology, we've made some key additions in the quarter, as the pre launch phase has given us comfort that we should pursue a full commercial launch in the second half as we had originally planned at the start of the year. We expect to be ready in time for the final reimbursement in colorectal cancer here in the second half. One other area that we think is going to require additional investment is in support of our pharma commercial and operations channel. The inbound demand for MRD guided clinical trials, including Phase 3 trials, and subsequent anticipated commercial volumes has pleasantly exceeded our expectations. We're continuing to make investments to support these larger deals. Some of that is reflected in increased R&D investments in the quarter. But also we continue to make progress with the BGI and FMI development efforts. As a reminder, we were paid cash upfront last year to support these teams. And now much of the effort is running through the R&D line. The balance of the increase in R&D is largely attributable to headcount to support several of the large clinical trials that we've launched and Solomon described. So in summary, we're glad to be ahead of schedule, in terms of making some of these client investments. And really most of this work is in the service of large, high margin, near term revenue opportunities. On the balance sheet, we raised cash via the seven year convertible note in the spring, which after the shoee, the principal amount was roughly $288 million, and a cash interest expense of two and a quarter percent. We paid off the OrbiMed loan in the second quarter. So total interest expense went up in the current quarter $3.8 million versus $2.2 million last year, but the cash portion of the convert interest is lower than the cash interest we used to pay to OrbiMed, and the cash interest for the convertible note was $1.4 million in the current quarter. Okay, on to the guide. We're very happy to be reinstating guidance for the year. And we're getting significantly above where we planned to be at the beginning of the year when COVID-19 was not even on our radar. This is really driven by the resilience we've seen in our existing customer base, stable ASPs, good cost trajectory and the strong response we've seen so far in the new businesses. By far the most impactful assumption on revenue and the model is that volume assumption implied by this guide. Although the business has performed well as Steve described, but we haven't been significantly impacted in areas where COVID-19 has surged more recently, this guide implies a significant amount of caution given the dynamic situation and uncertain timing of when we can get back to normal with routine access to accounts. Gross margin really just assumes continued progress in our plans to reduce COGS in the reproductive health business, which are on track and largely within our control. The top and bottom end is driven more by product mix, which again is driven by the volume assumption. I touched earlier on the rationale for stepping up expensive slightly, we're responding quickly to the demand we are seeing and the new clinical indication Steven and Solomon described and we're pleased to be accelerating our planned investments, as I mentioned. The net of the increase revenue and advancement for oncology means that the cash burn remains basically the same for the year, as compared to the original guide and the balance sheet remains strong. So with that, let me hand it back to the operator for question. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Doug Schenkel [Cowen and Company]. Sir, your line is open, please proceed.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon guys and great job in a challenging period. Mike, maybe building off of where you closed, as you noted, your revenue guidance is actually higher than where you started the year. I'm just wondering if it's possible to provide a bridge. It may not be, but I'm wondering, how much of a headwind COVID is expected to be in the context of full year guidance? And on the flip side, how much better are you now expecting, certain volume categories and ASPs to be versus original guidance, that that may be hard to do, but I figured out I\u2019d ask just case it is possible?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, no. Thanks, Doug. I appreciate the question. I mean, I think the \u2013 we certainly would be doing better this year, if it weren't for this lockdown situation, I think we'd be doing even better as we have our strong convictions. We were able to guide above where we started the year initially, really, because I think mainly because the volume performance, I think, exceeded our expectations. And then followed by, ASPs, I think have been stable, where I could if you recall, we had guided, some conservatism around the ASP that arose in the beginning of the year. So that slightly exceeded expectations. And then third, I think the, the new businesses, you know, are performing well. So I think it's, in order of magnitude, those point 1 through 3, those are the drivers. I do see - like we said on the call, in the prepared remarks, this does - the volume assumption for the second half a year does offer some caution as it relates to like sequential volume growth. Just because there's a lot of uncertainty and we're trying to monitor the situation. So we're still on the lookout for impacts from COVID. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's still - still is a bit of a headwind for us in the second half. Steve, would you add anything to that or?\nSteve Chapman: No, thanks, Mike. I mean, I guess I'll just reiterate that we - in the guide, even though we're raising the guide, you know, we have been conservative with the second half of the year just because of the surge in COVID. And that doesn't mean that we've seen any disruption in any of the new hotspots, because frankly, we haven't. And we think that you know, a lot of the centers and our sales team will put the necessary steps in place to manage through Corona. So we're not really seeing that dip, like we saw in some of the other hotspots in March. But with that said, just with the surge and seeing the sort of peak numbers at various places we wanted to be conservative with the guide, although we did raise.\nDoug Schenkel: Yes, and that that's really helpful, I guess, I guess that's kind of a good segue to just kind of what's contemplated in guidance. Like, is it fair to say at the low end of the range you're assuming there's some resurgence in infection rates put pressure on the margin?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that's right. I mean, I think that the lower end of the guide presumes kind of more disruption, you know, more kind of widespread lockdown kind of scenario akin to what we saw in the spring. And the upside, you know, the upper end of the guide presumes more gradual return to normal.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Last one, and I'll get back in the queue. Just a clean up question on gross margin guidance. Does that contemplate any benefit this year associated from the recent Illumina agreement? And if so, how should we think about quarterly pacing?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, it's not - there's not a huge benefit from the Illumina settlement. So as you recall that deal will go into effect in October. So just from a timing perspective, there's not going to be a lot of time for that. But you know, the benefit from that deal do affect full year gross margins.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, thank you again.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: The next question in the queue comes from Tyco Peterson. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks. I'll start with NIPT, it looks like Aetna extended the average risk policy through the end of the year. You know, is that factored in the guidance? And any thoughts on you know, that becoming permanent, any update from you know, United? And then, it seems like your growth on the volumes is obviously tremendous, how much of this is the market, you know, catching up versus share gains on your part for NIPT specifically? Thanks.\nMichael Brophy: I'll take the guide piece and then Steve, you want to talk to the second part?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, sure.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. So on the guide, yes. So the Aetna news, that is factored in, Tycho through the guide and then in terms of what we think about Aetna going forward, and the volumes, I hand it Steve.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I think there is a couple of factors that we think could really move the needle. You know, one is obviously an updated ACOG guideline, I think the other is the publication of the SMART study. And then I think the third is just continued pressure from physicians, patients in the community to have updated policies. And I think across each of those fronts we're seeing, you know, very positive momentum. We've said for a while now that we've heard updated ACOG guidelines are drafted and they're coming. We really don't know when that's going to happen. But we haven't heard anything that would indicate that, you know, they're negative or that's not the case. For the SMART trial, as we said in the prepared remarks. This is the largest prospective clinical trial in NIPT that's ever been done. And it's the largest average risk NIPT trial that's ever been done. And although, we're really excited about microdeletions, I don't want to overlook the fact that there's 20,000 patients many of which were average risk where we have aneuploidy results. And we have clinical outcomes through newborn karyotypes that were done on the baby. So we're in a very good position now to have this be a very significant tipping point, if we haven't seen ACPG guidance before then. And we've seen the aneuploidy data, and we still feel strongly that this trial has the opportunity to really move the needle significantly for Natera, and, you know, for the industry on the whole. And of course, we can't comment on the data at this point. And then I think the third thing is continued momentum with physician usage from patients and from others in the industry. And we're seeing now with Aetna extending their coverage, many of their physicians are getting comfortable with ordering and many of their patients have certain expectations for what's going to be covered. So I think it's a positive sign that they've continued to extend their coverage. And we don't know if that will become permanent at some point. But certainly, the fact that they're extending their coverage is a positive sign.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then it sounded like from your comments that, you know, IVF could also drive some upside in 2H in terms of picking up and helping with ASPs. Can you just elaborate on how mature you think that could be?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, so what we saw on the IVF business was really, almost immediately of like a roughly a 80% drop in, you know, late March, early April, because the centers were basically shut down. And around mid May, we started to see centers start to open back up, but they're still in this sort of, you know, social distancing, maybe low volume, less capacity than they would have been before just for safety reasons. So we think that there's certainly a swing to the upside there, and the second half the year and we've already started to see some of that come through in recent weeks. And I guess that the trend is heading in the direction we would expect it to be.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then two quick ones, before I hop off. On guidance, I just want to make sure that you didn't factor anything in on the Signatera China launch, given that that's year end, or is that factored in as well? And then you practically brought up the mobile offering? You know, we heard from one of your peers last night about how that had been very important in the COVID environment. Can you just talk to whether you're seeing increased uptake of the mobile offering in this environment as well?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, let me talk about that first, and then maybe Mike, you can comment on any of the channel revenue. So we had built an enormous infrastructure to deal with mobile patient, blood draws, mobile phlebotomy. We've been doing that for a long time. And we have very significant tools that enhance the user experience, that allow physicians to place orders, that allow patients to interact with genetic counselors and get kits shipped directly to them or have a mobile phlebotomist come directly to their house. So this is something that we had all the groundwork for, we really just had to flip the switch and expand it across all three businesses, women's health, the transplant organization, and in our pre launch oncology phase, we've seen a significant uptick from where we were previously. And it's certainly been a driver of us getting into new customers and extending our relationships with existing customers. And we're actually seeing, you know, quite a nice uptick across all three of those businesses at this point.\nMichael Brophy: Yes, the Signatera channel in terms BGI is not in the guide, and it's again, it's more of a timing thing. It just won't be live for long enough for the year to affect a full year guide.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Tycho.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Catherine Sheltie. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. And thanks for the questions. I guess, first starting last quarter, you referenced that volumes declined about 15% in the last two weeks of March versus prior one 1Q levels. Can you just walk us through what the rebound looked like throughout the second quarter? Or maybe how things were trending in July when we started to see a COVID resurgence in some geographies?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I'll take that. So yes, we did see, like we said IVF was down significantly. We saw some of the new businesses drop, you know, more significantly, initially. And then we saw some areas like New York, New Jersey, drop more significantly initially. What's happened since then is the core business has basically recovered. IVF has a very strong trajectory, heading throughout the month of July, as centers have started to open. The new businesses are actually above the levels where they were pre-COVID because of all of the tools that we put in place. And, you know, I think with the recent resurgence, although we've been cautious in our guidance, we've actually looked into the details and we haven't seen any disruption in some of the hotspot areas that you would think of now. So we're feeling good about the trajectory, but like we said, in the guidance, we just want to be cautious because of the uncertainty. I know most people actually aren\u2019t even guiding. But, you know, we felt like we could, you know, conservatively put out what we put out now given what we're seeing in the business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, very helpful. And any comments on how the initial Prospera launch has gone relative to your expectations and how much is baked into the 2020 guide for Prospero?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I would say it's exceeding our expectations. I think, specially in this COVID environment, I mean, we look at the breadth of customers that we're reaching, I think the value being placed on the product by key centers and key physicians, and then our, you know, relatively quick enrollment and site sign up in the proactive clinical trial. We're really pleased to see the engagement that we had at the ATC conference, we had very strong presence to see presentations where we had top principal investigators lined up. So we're feeling good about things and we're seeing the volume trajectory to meet our expectations. You know, of course, certainly it would be easier for us to launch new products if we weren't in this sort of lockdown, COVID environment, but I'm really impressed with the way that our team has been nimble and been able to continue to move the ball down the court and use our mobile solutions to continue to grow the business. From a guidance standpoint, Mike, do you want to make any comments on what's in the guide?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, I mean, so echo on Steve's comment. The reality is, I mean, just compared to the very large core business for a new product like Prospero, even for it to do well on a volume basis, doesn't really have to be much more than kind of smaller tailwind in terms of impact to the guide. So if it is contemplated in the guide that we would get paid for Medicare like we're getting paid? Yes. But again, very small in terms of the overall business for the second half of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And maybe last one for me just on Signatera for IO response monitoring. When do you think you could see a draft LCD for that indication? I think the turnaround time for colorectal is pretty swift, maybe a month or two, Prospera closer to five or six months. I think I heard Solomon say potentially by the end of the year, but just curious what your specific timing expectations are there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Catherine. I'll make a couple comments and then hand it over to Solomon. As I said, the beginning of the prepared and Solomon said, I mean, we're really excited about this opportunity because it basically is doubling what we had previously put out there for stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer. And with this Nature paper, it again puts us in a data leadership position to be on the front foot and go out and build this clinical market. And we've already completed a significant portion of the work, which is to get the paper published and then go get the dossier submitted to Medicare. So, Solomon, you want to comment specifically on what that pathway looks like for Medicare?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure, I think we've mentioned in the prepared remarks that we assuming MolDx remains positive on the validity and utility, which we expect based on multiple positive pre sub meetings. We would expect something either as soon as the end of you know, late second half of this year, or something in the early part of 2021. You know, MolDx has its own timelines and priorities, and those are also affected in various ways by the current environment. So, I'm certainly not in a position to speak for Medicare or for the MolDx group. But we think there's very strong momentum here.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Catherine.\nOperator: The next question in the queue comes from Max Masucci [Canaccord Genuity] Your line is open. Please proceed.\nMax Masucci: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. So, I mean, do you feel like you've been a meaningful share gainer in NIPT due to some of your larger competitors, wider testing portfolios? Maybe de- prioritizing NIPT in favor of COVID testing? And do you think that can be sticky? And then are you likely to prioritize your mobile tools beyond the pandemic, you know, as just the delivery of health care continues to evolve?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, so we definitely feel like we've been taking share but also continuing to impact the Greenfield opportunity. So if you remember NIPT, overall, we still think is only about 15% to 20% penetrated in you know, particularly in that average risk setting where there's a lot of customers that are still ordering high risk only. So we think there's a lot of room to grow. We just did a big market survey, where we, you know, in detail, you know, mapped out, high risk, low risk where the opportunity is. And it's really incredible how many physicians are still doing high risk only and how big that opportunity is. But when you look at the uniqueness of our offering where we have - we can detect things that simply other companies can't. Nobody else is doing the snip method. Everyone's doing shotgun sequencing, there's just biological limitations, things that they can detect. And you combine that with the extensive Rolodex of peer reviewed publications that we have at this point, we are by far, the leader now in published data. In fact, just recently, we had another publication in the Green Journal, with over a million patients study that confirmed are near 100% accuracy on fetal sex determination. So we just continue to push out evidence that shows are unique aspects and physicians now recognize us, as both the clinical and market leader. Now we've combined that with a strong sales force. And an extreme focus on user experience. A lot of the customer tools that are now being used in COVID are things that we've been investing in, you know, for the past four or five years. Mobile solutions, ways physicians can interact with patients, ways we can interact with physicians, and provide counseling for patients. So we certainly see that as a major part of the business going forward. I think, you know, to the extent that mobile phlebotomy itself is important, I think that really depends on you know, what happens with COVID long term, and you know, how frequently patients are returning to their offices. But absolutely, digital tools are very important. And we've always said the user expense is extremely important.\nMax Masucci: Great. And then can you just speak to how your automation initiatives are coming along? How far along are you with those projects? And when do you expect to really start gaining traction from some of those initiatives?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I think you're referring to some of the COGS initiatives that we've described previously. So is that correct?\nMax Masucci: Yes.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Okay. So, yes, so we had really a book of big R&D initiatives that we're working on throughout the year, this year, and then into the beginning of next year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we stay on track to our trajectory to bring our COGS down below, $200 in the reproductive health business. And there's a couple of ways we're getting get there. One is extraction automation, where we've actually now rolled out the initial version of that in our Austin facility. And that's going to be rolled out more broadly. As this year goes on, there's a couple other projects that we've talked about that rely on our deep neural networks project and the fact that we've run more than 2 million commercial samples, we can use that to reduce some of the sequencing costs. And then there's other R&D projects that we're working on that, you know, I don't want to go into detail on right now, but would reduce costs. So we think together, you know, there's still a good chunk coming out of where we are today from - from the future R&D projects. So the stuff is all coming along. It's on track. You know, as we said, we think it will make a meaningful impact. And then, of course, I think our updated supply agreement with Illumina has put us in a strong position to continue to focus on reducing our costs, as we grow our business and that can be another benefit for us in the future. Just one last comment on that, as I said in the remarks, you know, reproductive health, it has been our goal to get down below $200. As we start to see the mix change, and some of these other products come in, we'll try to provide more color on the reproductive health business, specifically, so you can track our progress on some of these key initiatives that are moving forward.\nMax Masucci: Great. And then if I can just squeeze one more, and could you just give us a directional idea of where your different direct sales forces stand for oncology and for transplant? Just any idea about where these may shake out in the near or medium term? Thanks.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, so, you know, we've said previously on the oncology side that, you know, we had hired 25 sales reps, and that we were going to be expanding that somewhat as we go into the full commercial launch. We kind of have a sense of where some of the other teams are. And we sort of have now, kind of a schedule based on how many accounts are out there, how many calls we want people to make, and so forth. And so we, we have a good sense of what the optimized number looks like. For competitive reasons, you know, we haven't really been giving the exact number of reps that are out there. You know, on the transplant side, we've said before that, you know, we think that you can be - you can cover the market with a relatively small force, because there's only 200 transplant centers that are of meaningful size, and you just really don't need a big team. And then I think, you know, in women's health, we've sort of said the OpEx has generally been flat there, maybe slightly up as things vary a little bit. But, you know, overall, I think we really haven't been giving any exact numbers.\nMax Masucci: Great. Well, congratulations on the continued progress. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you The next question the cute comes from Steven Ma. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Just a few follow up questions on the Signatera and wanted to follow up on Katherine's questions about the IO response monitoring application. So is the draft or is your dossier? Is it going to call out specific cancers or is it going to be a pan cancer, because I noticed on the Nature paper, you know, there was 25 solid tumors in there. So maybe just a little color on strategy there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, Solomon, do you want to take that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. At a high level, we believe that there is ample evidence for validity and utility of using Signatera in a pan cancer fashion. So for any cancer type, any solid tumor type where the patient's indicated to either begin or continue treatment with immunotherapy, we see value being added by using Signatera in conjunction with imaging to aid decision making along the way. And, and we've discussed that specifically with the team at Medicare and I look forward to seeing what the final decision and you know, draft policies will look like.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That's fantastic if you can do that. And then my last question is on the metastatic CRC application, it sounds like it's going to be an amendment to the existing draft LCD. So maybe a little color and how that works. Do you have to wait for the final LCD or can you amend it in parallel, while you're still getting the final LCD.\nSteve Chapman: So I think that the simple answer here is we're not 100% sure, because we haven't seen the final LCD. And, you know, based on what that final policy will look like, will dictate what approach we take. There are pathways for amendment and, you know, other paths that should be a little bit more streamlined than going out to get a brand new local coverage decision. So, you know, once we see that final will, we'll be able to share more details about the plan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks so much for the questions.\nMichael Brophy: And Steve, I guess, I'll just add one other comment to that. I mean, if you remember I take the open comment period started in kind of roughly October of last year. So we're sort of coming up on that sort of mark where, you know, they're statutorily required to release that final LCD. So we think actually the final LCD could be coming in the near future. And so it's not really a long wait to sort of see what's in there. And then as Solomon also mentioned on CRC, we have this - although we presented great data ESMO GI, what we're actually really excited about is just prospective trial data from a Phase 2 study that's being presented at ESMO. And that will be submitted as a peer reviewed publication. So I think there's a little bit more of a lift there, but the data looks fantastic. And that's, really the biggest hurdle is, is generating this data. You know, not necessarily at this point for us, you know, getting the submissions down because it's sort of become a well oiled machine for us.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. The last question will come from Alex Noack. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Actually just following up on that last point right there. So I think statutorily, it's got to be issued by August 22 or so. So just any update on the conversations you're having with Palmetto? And am I correct that has to be issued by that date, or has to be dropped and the anything on pricing?\nSteve Chapman: No, just one correction. So it's basically 12 months from the October date, 12 months from the start of the open comment period. So we think it should be coming in before - we think it should be coming in before October. So, you know, I think it's up to a couple of months left before that comes in. But it's, you know, it's near term, certainly. And we look forward to that coming out. We've been in active engagement with them, you know, like we said, we completed multiple pre submission meetings on IO recently as recent as you know, early summer and sort of late spring, and then we submitted the dossier for IO, you know, as we said in June. So there's a lot of engagement there, and we feel like that's actually - the CRC final is on track, and we're really excited. We're sort of gearing up for that to come out in the next couple of months.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. Thanks for the correction there as well. And then the IO monitoring application certainly seems pretty unique, pretty valuable to patients. Now Signatera CRC, that's designed for recurrence monitoring, this new indication is very much upstream for treatment monitoring. So the use cases are different. Just how do you plan to leverage the oncology sales team itself both into a recurrence and a treatment monitoring application?\nSteve Chapman: So I'll make a couple high level comments and then Solomon, or Mike feel free to jump in. I think first, there's certainly quite a bit of overlap, particularly in the community, on the ordering physicians. I think when you get into some of the academic centers, you see more specialization, but the very large community practice network that we're going to be targeting, there's going to be quite a bit of overlap in synergies within the sales force. So we're excited about that. I think the second, one of the - one for us, one of the key rationales for doing the partnership with Foundation Medicines, was because they're brilliantly set up to just dominate in this particular space. And, you know, having already run the therapy selection panel, having already, you know, performed as many tests as they perform and just have this dominant sales team, we certainly think that having them out in the field, with an indication like this is going to be very meaningful. And combined with our force, you know, our separate product, I think it's going to put us in a place to really lock this down, very, very quickly.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes\u2026\nSteve Chapman: Go ahead, Solomon.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes, I was just going to add, I think we're excited about the opportunity to leverage the same oncology field for us to be able to educate customers about both use cases. And as Steve mentioned, you know, it's roughly 80, 20 community versus academia where patients are treated. So there, you know, there's massive overlap in the customer relationships we've already built. In academia where we, today we really focused on GI oncologist, gastrointestinal oncologist for rollout of the CRC application. I think the great news is that there's been so much excitement and engagement on the research front with other specialties, you know, from breast cancer, lung cancer, GU cancers, et cetera, that I think a lot of those relationships are already being developed and are going to set us up for success.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, appreciate. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just last question. I know you were billing UnitedHealthcare and appealing any denials more aggressively based on the society for field medicine decision. Can you just say if in a quarter or maybe July or, you know, first week in August, if any of those denials by UNH that you went ahead and appealed are starting to get paid?\nSteve Chapman: Mike, you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. So I mean, I think the best way to track this is just by the coverage policies that the various payers have put out and it's basically status quo, with the exception of Aetna extending to the end of the year at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, understood. Thank you appreciate it.\nOperator: Sir, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Brophy for any closing remarks.\nMichael Brophy: Well, thank you all for joining, fantastic questions, is a pleasure to be with you, and we're looking forward to the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. The first slide here summarizes the commercial verticals we are pursuing within oncology. As a reminder, we signed a deal with Foundation Medicine last year to co-develop a test similar to Signatera, which leverages the tumor genomic data identified in a FoundationOne CDx test to design a personalized assay for each patient for serial monitoring of their ctDNA. We continue to think this is an elegant combination of industry-leading technologies from both companies. And we are excited to have the foundation oncology field force out marketing the product to both biopharma and clinical customers. We expect the new test to fit especially well for the immunotherapy response monitoring indication, which I'll discuss in greater detail in a moment. The co-development effort is going well and we remain on track for Foundation Medicine to be engaging with pharma customers this year. Another key partnership for us is with BGI, to bring Signatera technology to China. We remain on track there to get the initial launch in China by the end of this year, and we have already signed deals with leading biopharma that are just waiting for the service to launch. Within our direct commercial effort, demand in our pharma channel has been exceeding our expectations. We are generating new data together with pharma clients at a rapid pace. And the data that we presented at ASCO in collaboration with Genentech was well received. As our pharma clients plan to launch more MRD guided clinical trials, we are continuing to invest. Mike will touch on this further in his guide. We expect more news flow from the pharma channel in the second half of the year, but for today, we want to focus on new developments in our clinical channel. In the direct clinical channel, we have been extremely pleased with the reception we've gotten from the pre-launch phase for Signatera in colorectal cancer. Steve mentioned we started enrolling in the BESPOKE trial and the idea of surgery at trial, and the IDEA-CIRCULATE trial. And the initial uptake and feedback from NCCN centers and other leading institutions has been very positive. With this strong momentum, plus the new opportunity we are pursuing in immunotherapy response monitoring, we're moving forward with commercial expansion plans to ensure full access nationwide. Checking in on our reimbursement path now for the indication in stage two and three colorectal cancer, where we received the draft coverage decision for Medicare. We initially set out a goal to have final reimbursement in the second half of this year, and nothing has changed from that expectation. Now, I'm excited to discuss the two new clinical indications that Steve touched on in his intro, oligometastatic CRC and IO monitoring. I will describe the metastatic CRC opportunity first, which is really an extension of our existing application in colorectal cancer. If you recall, our initial indication was focused on stage two and three CRC, based on validation data we published last year in JAMA Oncology. We have now generated data that shows the validity of Signatera in CRC patients with stage four oligometastatic disease, which represents about 20% to 30% of all stage four CRC patients. In oligometastatic disease there are generally only a few metastatic lesions, usually isolated to the liver, which can be treated with curative intent surgery, plus or minus adjuvant chemotherapy. Many of these patients can be cured with surgery alone, but doctors today do not have good diagnostic tools to determine which patients need adjuvant chemotherapy and the NCCN guidelines are vague on this front. These patients may also benefit from early relapse detection, as the relapse may again be oligometastatic and eligible for local treatment if caught early enough. This is where Signatera can help clarify which patients still have residual disease in their blood after surgery. At the ESMO GI World Congress, back in July, Dr. Stacy Cohen from the University of Washington presented data showing Signatera detected ctDNA prior to surgery in 100% of patients with confirmed oligometastatic disease, and half of patients from the first blood sample taken after surgery still had circulating DNA. This is consistent with what many doctors had expected based on published relapse rates. But now Signatera allows them to get this information in closer to real time when they can make a better decision on chemotherapy after surgery. We have recently had a separate data set from a prospective Phase 2 study accepted for presentation at ESMO in September, which will further bolster the evidence base for this patient population. As Steve described, we look forward to working with Medicare to include this application under the coverage policy. Turning the page now, we have a totally new opportunity for Signatera in immunotherapy response monitoring, or what we like to call IO monitoring for short. Let's start first with the problem statement here, which is pretty different from what we are doing in CRC. More than 200,000 patients are estimated to receive immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment every year across a range of cancer types. And that number is growing with every successful new pharma trial. While immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care in many ways, and brought hope and cure to many. It is expensive, and many experienced immune related adverse events. But still the majority of patients do not respond to this type of treatment, despite the introduction of predictive biomarkers. One particular challenge is how to determine whether the treatment is working after it has been initiated, and when it may be appropriate to discontinue or switch treatment strategies, there are many points of clinical uncertainty during a patient's journey with immunotherapy. But one that we want to highlight here is a phenomenon called pseudoprogression. If a patient is not responding to treatment, you would expect the tumor to get larger on a scan over time. However, up to one in 10 immunotherapy treated patients see their tumors get bigger before it gets smaller, because it's being filled with lymphocytes and swelling up under attack from the immune system. With a CT scan, this swelling looks like a true disease progression, which it's not, hence the term pseudoprogression. Though this phenomenon is not super common, it actually impacts care for most patients. Because everyone with increasing tumor volume on a CT scan hopes that they might be the one in 10. As a result of this uncertainty, current guidelines suggest that physicians continue treating beyond progression, until they see confirmation of progression in a follow up scan, which can be approximately six to 12 weeks later. This extra treatment can significantly delay sick patients from switching to other available lines of therapy that may be more effective or can result in premature withdrawal for a patient who may actually be sensitive to the treatment. And of course during the COVID-19 outbreak getting routine CT scans for these compromised patients is even more challenging. Based on the published evidence, we think a serial testing protocol with Signatera could significantly help improve this picture, setting a baseline ctDNA measurement before treatment and then following up regularly in conjunction with imaging to help identify true disease progression earlier. In addition to ruling out pseudoprogression, serial follow up with Signatera can also identify patients with secondary resistance before it's noted on imaging, helping to decide whether to modify or potentially switch treatment strategies. And it can also identify exceptional responders who clear their ctDNA completely and might be eligible for an early drug holiday. If you assume four Signatera tests per year for over 200,000 patients, we think the addressable market for Signatera in this indication could exceed 800,000 tests annually, as Steve described. So there's a fast growing body of scientific literature that validates the use of ctDNA for this purpose. To highlight a few quotes here from earlier academic studies, and nature reviews article concluded that monitoring of ctDNA levels has now been shown to be a clinically valid method of assessing the early efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. A JAMA Oncology article found that ctDNA profiles can accurately differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression. And an article in Clinical Cancer Research reported these findings provide rationale for use of ctDNA in conjunction with standard imaging to provide an earlier and more comprehensive assessment of immunotherapy efficacy. So the momentum within the clinical community for this indication strong. Now our paper is the first to validate these results using a commercial grade technology. In this perspective, Phase 2 study called INSPIRE published in Nature Cancer on Monday, patients with 25 different types of solid cancer received the Merck drug pembrolizumab and were monitored regularly with both CT scans and personalized ctDNA assessments. At just six weeks into treatment, 42% of those patients showed increasing tumor volume on CT scan and increasing ctDNA, of whom 100% were later confirmed to be non-responsive to the treatment. These patients received on average six extra weeks of treatment that potentially could have been avoided. Signatera also identified 16% of patients who completely clear their ctDNA during treatment. And 100% of those patients survived through the end of the study period, with a median of 25.4 months of follow up beyond the first clearance of their tumor DNA. Based on the strength of this data and early feedback from leading oncologists, we think IO monitoring will have a meaningful impact for patients, doctors and health systems. So we're moving fast now to commercialize. The next slide shows where we are in that process with Medicare. Hopefully, the slide format will look familiar as this is now our third time down the path with the same group at MolDx. We've now had multiple positive pre-submission meetings with MolDx on this topic, and we have formally submitted our dossier for review. If MolDx remains positive on the clinical validity and utility here, the next step could be a draft coverage decision, which we may receive in late 2020, or the first half of 2020. So in summary, the oncology business is progressing rapidly. With that, let me hand the call over to Mike to review the financials. Mike? Sure, I think we've mentioned in the prepared remarks that we assuming MolDx remains positive on the validity and utility, which we expect based on multiple positive pre sub meetings. We would expect something either as soon as the end of you know, late second half of this year, or something in the early part of 2021. You know, MolDx has its own timelines and priorities, and those are also affected in various ways by the current environment. So, I'm certainly not in a position to speak for Medicare or for the MolDx group. But we think there's very strong momentum here. Sure. At a high level, we believe that there is ample evidence for validity and utility of using Signatera in a pan cancer fashion. So for any cancer type, any solid tumor type where the patient's indicated to either begin or continue treatment with immunotherapy, we see value being added by using Signatera in conjunction with imaging to aid decision making along the way. And, and we've discussed that specifically with the team at Medicare and I look forward to seeing what the final decision and you know, draft policies will look like. Yes... Yes, I was just going to add, I think we're excited about the opportunity to leverage the same oncology field for us to be able to educate customers about both use cases. And as Steve mentioned, you know, it's roughly 80, 20 community versus academia where patients are treated. So there, you know, there's massive overlap in the customer relationships we've already built. In academia where we, today we really focused on GI oncologist, gastrointestinal oncologist for rollout of the CRC application. I think the great news is that there's been so much excitement and engagement on the research front with other specialties, you know, from breast cancer, lung cancer, GU cancers, et cetera, that I think a lot of those relationships are already being developed and are going to set us up for success."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me get into the highlights. Q2 was another very strong quarter for Natera. We processed 234,000 tests in the quarter, which was essentially on par with our all-time record Q1 volumes, despite the obvious impacts from COVID-19. We generated $86.5 million in revenues on a 46% gross margin and grew product revenues approximately 24% year-on-year We started enrolling patients in three separate large prospective trials, BESPOKE and IDEA-CIRCULATE for Signatera in colorectal cancer and the proactive trial for Prospera in kidney transplant rejection screening. These are key trials that we believe will extend our leadership position in these areas. I'm sure many of you saw that we have now completed the process to get reimbursed for Prospera. And so far, we are being paid as expected by CMS. We were very pleased to receive the Force of Change Illuminator Award from Leading Women Entrepreneurs, which is an organization that is recognized over 500 outstanding women leaders in innovative companies over the past day. Sheetal Parmar, who leads the Clinical Services and Medical Education teams at Natera and is Cochair of Women of Natera, an employee resource group that supports workplace equality and diversity was also recognized for her individual contributions in Natera's mission and values. So we just wanted to say thank you and congratulate Sheetal and the women of Natera for their leadership. In our oncology effort, first in IO monitoring. Just this week, we saw the publication of a groundbreaking validation study in Nature Cancer, demonstrating Signatera's ability to monitor tumor response to immunotherapy in 25 different types of solid cancer. Second in colorectal cancer, we presented data at ASCO and ESMO GI that supports the use of Signatera for metastatic colorectal cancer, with a prospective publication to follow. Based on the strong data, I'm very pleased today to announce two new clinic expansion opportunities where we're seeking reimbursement for Signatera, as you can see on this next slide. We think together these new opportunities represent approximately 900,000 additional tests per year, nearly doubling our previous addressable market associated with stage two and three colorectal cancer. So all combined, we think we have a clear path for reimbursement and commercialization in clinical settings that represent roughly 2 million tests per year. In IO monitoring, we have already completed a positive pre-submission meeting and formally submitted our dossier for local coverage decision to Medicare and what would be our second major reimburse clinical indication for Signatera. In metastatic colorectal cancer, we plan to submit this indication to expand the previous colorectal cancer indication soon. Solomon will describe these indications in more detail later in the call. The next slide shows our volume performance by quarter. Each of the last few years we've seen a very large step up in the Q1 volumes over prior years. And then due to seasonal factors that we've described in the past, Q2 volumes are typically just below Q1. In 2019 Q2 volumes pulled back 3% from Q1 2019. This year in 2020, we saw a smaller pullback of about a half percentage point versus our record Q1 2020. This is remarkable, given the scale of the disruption to the economy in Q2. During the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, we immediately saw a drop in our weekly received volumes of about 15% in the last two weeks of March and first few weeks of April. And then we saw weekly volume starts to recover toward Q1 levels, as our existing customers and the accounts we won early in Q1 figured out how to reopen their practices to maintain critical services, like non-invasive prenatal testing. Mike will talk more about the outlook later in the call. But we're feeling good about our existing customers ability to weather COVID-19 surges in the second half of the year. In order to grow, we also need a new - to win new accounts. While I still think it's clearly easier to win new business when a rep has unfettered access to a clinic, we have made good use of our remote tools. And we built and have a number of encouraging customer wins since our last earnings call. So we're monitoring the situation as you'd expect, but we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year. The next slide shows a revenue trajectory over time. I'd note that partner revenue recognition in Q2 of 2019, included $5 million from BGI compared to only about $1.2 million for BGI and Foundation Medicine combined in Q2 of 2020. So the underlying product revenue trends in the business remain very strong, as I mentioned. The next slide is our typical ASP and COGS view, which came in as we had expected, and I think shows our momentum is intact. On the ASP front, we had both headwinds and tailwind in the quarter. As expected, our IVF channel was much more severely impacted than our core channel, as it was initially considered elective, and many centers closed. The products we sell in that IVF channel have a much higher average price per test than the core reproductive health channel. So we suffered a bit from a less favorable product mix. I think that's more of a timing issue. It's likely that a lot of these IVF customers that were put on hold in the spring will find a way to push forward in the next three to four quarters, so the IVF volume I think can swing in our favour when that happens. The main tailwind we had was Aetna, extending their average risk NIPT coverage due to the pandemic. And we just saw over the weekend that they've chosen to extend coverage now to the end of the year, which of course we were very glad to see. So I view this ASP result as more or less status quo, as expected given the factors outlined. One other long term potential benefit to both ASP and average risk adoption is the publication of the SMART study. The study enrollment is now completed, and we expect data to be published and presented around the SMFM conference in roughly six months. As a reminder, SMART is a landmark 20,000 patient multi site prospective clinical trial we've been running for the past five years. We expect multiple papers from the study, one focused on fetal aneuploidy in both average risk and high risk pregnancies, and one focus on microdeletions. The aneuploidy data has been analyzed and the microdeletion data has yet to be released. Although we can't comment on the performance, because this is the largest perspective, average risk aneuploidy and microdeletion trial to be completed, we think SMART could have a positive impact on society guidelines and coverage policies for both indications. We also expect to generate additional demand for Panorama given our leadership in clinical validation data that extends further with the SMART trial completed. I've got largely the same takeaway for COGS per unit in the quarter. We added some redundancy to fortify our lab operations team to make sure we are robust to COVID-19, including the expansion at our Austin lab facility, and we anticipate needing to maintain that redundancy over the next few quarters. Having said that, the new workflow improvements coming out R&D that have caused a step change improvement versus last year performed even better in Q2 than they did in Q1. So we're very confident our plan for COGS below $200 for the reproductive health business is achievable. Now last point getting below $200 for the reproductive health business it's important to note,, as our product mix changes to include new products like Signatera, the average COGS will change as well. So we'll track these overall metrics, but I anticipate giving some separate color in the future on reproductive health COGS. You will recall, the number one goal in the company is to get the reproductive health business to cash flow breakeven. This comes from strategic volume growth, stable ASPs and COGS getting lower. Despite all the impacts from COVID-19, all of the variables that we've just walked through give us the confidence that we are on track to achieve that goal, while we rapidly scale the new business. Just one more check-in second slide on our operational response to COVID. The mobile tools for patients and customers which have been available for years are scaling nicely. We've seen this mobile offering proved to be particularly critical and starting new accounts for Signatera and Prospera, given these patients tend to be you know compromised and also have a critical need to be consistently monitored. I mentioned the Austin lab expansion as well. This was executed smoothly despite the pandemic. The Austin lab gives us critical redundancy to our California lab and offers capacity of more than 2 million tests annually and it should in the future offer additional cost of goods sold efficiencies once at scale. We've also launched a wide array of safety and protective testing protocols for both labs and feel confident we have a good model for consistent operations in this new environment. Okay, now, let me shift the focus to the Transplant business. As I mentioned, we're very pleased to get final reimbursement for Prospera. This slide is the same slide we first presented in 2018. And we're now happy to retire it. As you'll see later in the call, we of course following the same path now for a number of indications and oncology. We've been able to submit claims to Medicare for Prospera and so far received reimbursement consistent with the final pricing of 2841 per test assigned to us by the MolDx program. So we have now executed our commercial launch. We described on our last call the success we had during our pre launch phase for Prospera, in which we demonstrated that we could access a broad swath of the transplant centers. We're still in the early days of the launch. And despite the ongoing pandemic, we continue to feel confident that Prospera can be a significant contributor for the company. As described on the next slide, we've continued to generate data and improve the performance of the test. Given that we have run more than 2 million cell-free DNA tests commercially at Natera, we built up a huge data set that we can query to further refine Prospera's algorithm. This spring, we launched an improvement to the algorithm that identifies patients with elevated background levels of cell-free DNA in their blood. This can provide critical information. For example, we've seen patients affected by COVID-19 can have very elevated levels of background cell-free DNA. Being able to identify elevated levels of background DNA allows us to identify patients who might be at risk of a false negative result, where the donor signal is simply diluted by an extremely elevated background signal. So we presented several case studies on this new technology at ATC this year. And we also announced the launch of a prospective trial, the PEDAL study to externally validate this enhanced algorithm. And we plan to run that study in 500 patients across several major transplant centers. Dr. Brennan from Johns Hopkins and Dr. Bunnapradist from UCLA introduced the study at ATC to great perception. These are two premier physician researchers from two of the largest and most prestigious centers in the world. We're excited to leverage our scientific expertise and our leadership and cell-free DNA to help transplant patients and we look forward to continuing our early success in the second half of the year. Now, let me hand the reins over to Solomon to cover our progress in oncology. Solomon? No, thanks, Mike. I mean, I guess I'll just reiterate that we - in the guide, even though we're raising the guide, you know, we have been conservative with the second half of the year just because of the surge in COVID. And that doesn't mean that we've seen any disruption in any of the new hotspots, because frankly, we haven't. And we think that you know, a lot of the centers and our sales team will put the necessary steps in place to manage through Corona. So we're not really seeing that dip, like we saw in some of the other hotspots in March. But with that said, just with the surge and seeing the sort of peak numbers at various places we wanted to be conservative with the guide, although we did raise. Yes, that's right. I mean, I think that the lower end of the guide presumes kind of more disruption, you know, more kind of widespread lockdown kind of scenario akin to what we saw in the spring. And the upside, you know, the upper end of the guide presumes more gradual return to normal. Yes, it's not - there's not a huge benefit from the Illumina settlement. So as you recall that deal will go into effect in October. So just from a timing perspective, there's not going to be a lot of time for that. But you know, the benefit from that deal do affect full year gross margins. Thanks, Doug. Yes, sure. Yes. I think there is a couple of factors that we think could really move the needle. You know, one is obviously an updated ACOG guideline, I think the other is the publication of the SMART study. And then I think the third is just continued pressure from physicians, patients in the community to have updated policies. And I think across each of those fronts we're seeing, you know, very positive momentum. We've said for a while now that we've heard updated ACOG guidelines are drafted and they're coming. We really don't know when that's going to happen. But we haven't heard anything that would indicate that, you know, they're negative or that's not the case. For the SMART trial, as we said in the prepared remarks. This is the largest prospective clinical trial in NIPT that's ever been done. And it's the largest average risk NIPT trial that's ever been done. And although, we're really excited about microdeletions, I don't want to overlook the fact that there's 20,000 patients many of which were average risk where we have aneuploidy results. And we have clinical outcomes through newborn karyotypes that were done on the baby. So we're in a very good position now to have this be a very significant tipping point, if we haven't seen ACPG guidance before then. And we've seen the aneuploidy data, and we still feel strongly that this trial has the opportunity to really move the needle significantly for Natera, and, you know, for the industry on the whole. And of course, we can't comment on the data at this point. And then I think the third thing is continued momentum with physician usage from patients and from others in the industry. And we're seeing now with Aetna extending their coverage, many of their physicians are getting comfortable with ordering and many of their patients have certain expectations for what's going to be covered. So I think it's a positive sign that they've continued to extend their coverage. And we don't know if that will become permanent at some point. But certainly, the fact that they're extending their coverage is a positive sign. Yes, so what we saw on the IVF business was really, almost immediately of like a roughly a 80% drop in, you know, late March, early April, because the centers were basically shut down. And around mid May, we started to see centers start to open back up, but they're still in this sort of, you know, social distancing, maybe low volume, less capacity than they would have been before just for safety reasons. So we think that there's certainly a swing to the upside there, and the second half the year and we've already started to see some of that come through in recent weeks. And I guess that the trend is heading in the direction we would expect it to be. Yes, let me talk about that first, and then maybe Mike, you can comment on any of the channel revenue. So we had built an enormous infrastructure to deal with mobile patient, blood draws, mobile phlebotomy. We've been doing that for a long time. And we have very significant tools that enhance the user experience, that allow physicians to place orders, that allow patients to interact with genetic counselors and get kits shipped directly to them or have a mobile phlebotomist come directly to their house. So this is something that we had all the groundwork for, we really just had to flip the switch and expand it across all three businesses, women's health, the transplant organization, and in our pre launch oncology phase, we've seen a significant uptick from where we were previously. And it's certainly been a driver of us getting into new customers and extending our relationships with existing customers. And we're actually seeing, you know, quite a nice uptick across all three of those businesses at this point. Thanks, Tycho. Yes, I'll take that. So yes, we did see, like we said IVF was down significantly. We saw some of the new businesses drop, you know, more significantly, initially. And then we saw some areas like New York, New Jersey, drop more significantly initially. What's happened since then is the core business has basically recovered. IVF has a very strong trajectory, heading throughout the month of July, as centers have started to open. The new businesses are actually above the levels where they were pre-COVID because of all of the tools that we put in place. And, you know, I think with the recent resurgence, although we've been cautious in our guidance, we've actually looked into the details and we haven't seen any disruption in some of the hotspot areas that you would think of now. So we're feeling good about the trajectory, but like we said, in the guidance, we just want to be cautious because of the uncertainty. I know most people actually aren't even guiding. But, you know, we felt like we could, you know, conservatively put out what we put out now given what we're seeing in the business. Yes, I would say it's exceeding our expectations. I think, specially in this COVID environment, I mean, we look at the breadth of customers that we're reaching, I think the value being placed on the product by key centers and key physicians, and then our, you know, relatively quick enrollment and site sign up in the proactive clinical trial. We're really pleased to see the engagement that we had at the ATC conference, we had very strong presence to see presentations where we had top principal investigators lined up. So we're feeling good about things and we're seeing the volume trajectory to meet our expectations. You know, of course, certainly it would be easier for us to launch new products if we weren't in this sort of lockdown, COVID environment, but I'm really impressed with the way that our team has been nimble and been able to continue to move the ball down the court and use our mobile solutions to continue to grow the business. From a guidance standpoint, Mike, do you want to make any comments on what's in the guide? Yes. Thanks, Catherine. I'll make a couple comments and then hand it over to Solomon. As I said, the beginning of the prepared and Solomon said, I mean, we're really excited about this opportunity because it basically is doubling what we had previously put out there for stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer. And with this Nature paper, it again puts us in a data leadership position to be on the front foot and go out and build this clinical market. And we've already completed a significant portion of the work, which is to get the paper published and then go get the dossier submitted to Medicare. So, Solomon, you want to comment specifically on what that pathway looks like for Medicare? Thanks, Catherine. Yes, so we definitely feel like we've been taking share but also continuing to impact the Greenfield opportunity. So if you remember NIPT, overall, we still think is only about 15% to 20% penetrated in you know, particularly in that average risk setting where there's a lot of customers that are still ordering high risk only. So we think there's a lot of room to grow. We just did a big market survey, where we, you know, in detail, you know, mapped out, high risk, low risk where the opportunity is. And it's really incredible how many physicians are still doing high risk only and how big that opportunity is. But when you look at the uniqueness of our offering where we have - we can detect things that simply other companies can't. Nobody else is doing the snip method. Everyone's doing shotgun sequencing, there's just biological limitations, things that they can detect. And you combine that with the extensive Rolodex of peer reviewed publications that we have at this point, we are by far, the leader now in published data. In fact, just recently, we had another publication in the Green Journal, with over a million patients study that confirmed are near 100% accuracy on fetal sex determination. So we just continue to push out evidence that shows are unique aspects and physicians now recognize us, as both the clinical and market leader. Now we've combined that with a strong sales force. And an extreme focus on user experience. A lot of the customer tools that are now being used in COVID are things that we've been investing in, you know, for the past four or five years. Mobile solutions, ways physicians can interact with patients, ways we can interact with physicians, and provide counseling for patients. So we certainly see that as a major part of the business going forward. I think, you know, to the extent that mobile phlebotomy itself is important, I think that really depends on you know, what happens with COVID long term, and you know, how frequently patients are returning to their offices. But absolutely, digital tools are very important. And we've always said the user expense is extremely important. Yes, I think you're referring to some of the COGS initiatives that we've described previously. So is that correct? Yes. Okay. So, yes, so we had really a book of big R&D initiatives that we're working on throughout the year, this year, and then into the beginning of next year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we stay on track to our trajectory to bring our COGS down below, $200 in the reproductive health business. And there's a couple of ways we're getting get there. One is extraction automation, where we've actually now rolled out the initial version of that in our Austin facility. And that's going to be rolled out more broadly. As this year goes on, there's a couple other projects that we've talked about that rely on our deep neural networks project and the fact that we've run more than 2 million commercial samples, we can use that to reduce some of the sequencing costs. And then there's other R&D projects that we're working on that, you know, I don't want to go into detail on right now, but would reduce costs. So we think together, you know, there's still a good chunk coming out of where we are today from - from the future R&D projects. So the stuff is all coming along. It's on track. You know, as we said, we think it will make a meaningful impact. And then, of course, I think our updated supply agreement with Illumina has put us in a strong position to continue to focus on reducing our costs, as we grow our business and that can be another benefit for us in the future. Just one last comment on that, as I said in the remarks, you know, reproductive health, it has been our goal to get down below $200. As we start to see the mix change, and some of these other products come in, we'll try to provide more color on the reproductive health business, specifically, so you can track our progress on some of these key initiatives that are moving forward. Yes, so, you know, we've said previously on the oncology side that, you know, we had hired 25 sales reps, and that we were going to be expanding that somewhat as we go into the full commercial launch. We kind of have a sense of where some of the other teams are. And we sort of have now, kind of a schedule based on how many accounts are out there, how many calls we want people to make, and so forth. And so we, we have a good sense of what the optimized number looks like. For competitive reasons, you know, we haven't really been giving the exact number of reps that are out there. You know, on the transplant side, we've said before that, you know, we think that you can be - you can cover the market with a relatively small force, because there's only 200 transplant centers that are of meaningful size, and you just really don't need a big team. And then I think, you know, in women's health, we've sort of said the OpEx has generally been flat there, maybe slightly up as things vary a little bit. But, you know, overall, I think we really haven't been giving any exact numbers. Yes, Solomon, do you want to take that? So I think that the simple answer here is we're not 100% sure, because we haven't seen the final LCD. And, you know, based on what that final policy will look like, will dictate what approach we take. There are pathways for amendment and, you know, other paths that should be a little bit more streamlined than going out to get a brand new local coverage decision. So, you know, once we see that final will, we'll be able to share more details about the plan. No, just one correction. So it's basically 12 months from the October date, 12 months from the start of the open comment period. So we think it should be coming in before - we think it should be coming in before October. So, you know, I think it's up to a couple of months left before that comes in. But it's, you know, it's near term, certainly. And we look forward to that coming out. We've been in active engagement with them, you know, like we said, we completed multiple pre submission meetings on IO recently as recent as you know, early summer and sort of late spring, and then we submitted the dossier for IO, you know, as we said in June. So there's a lot of engagement there, and we feel like that's actually - the CRC final is on track, and we're really excited. We're sort of gearing up for that to come out in the next couple of months. So I'll make a couple high level comments and then Solomon, or Mike feel free to jump in. I think first, there's certainly quite a bit of overlap, particularly in the community, on the ordering physicians. I think when you get into some of the academic centers, you see more specialization, but the very large community practice network that we're going to be targeting, there's going to be quite a bit of overlap in synergies within the sales force. So we're excited about that. I think the second, one of the - one for us, one of the key rationales for doing the partnership with Foundation Medicines, was because they're brilliantly set up to just dominate in this particular space. And, you know, having already run the therapy selection panel, having already, you know, performed as many tests as they perform and just have this dominant sales team, we certainly think that having them out in the field, with an indication like this is going to be very meaningful. And combined with our force, you know, our separate product, I think it's going to put us in a place to really lock this down, very, very quickly. Go ahead, Solomon. Mike, you want to take that?"

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019re going to review the highlights from the quarter, summarize the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and our response and give you an update on our clinical and commercial progress in transplant and oncology. On to the highlights. We posted $94 million in revenues and a 52% gross margin in the quarter, which is by far the best quarter we\u2019ve ever had as a company and significantly above the range of $89 million to $91 million we preannounced. Q1 was the largest sequential quarter-on-quarter unit growth in the company\u2019s history, despite the disruption in March from COVID-19. Revenues grew 41% over Q1 2019, driven by the strong volumes and another positive quarter for average selling prices. We were also very pleased to achieve a cost of goods sold of $202 per unit accessioned in our lab, very close to the $200 per unit level, we had set as a long-term target. I will spend more time on both ASP and COGS later in the call. We also witnessed a very successful early launch of our Prospera test in the kidney transplant space. In a very short timeframe, we saw orders from 45% of the top 50 and 37% of the top 100 transplant centers by volume. We also activated 18 top centers in the ProActive registry trial, enrolling 145 patients. We think these exceptional initial results indicate significant interest for a more accurate donor-derived cell-free DNA test. We also responded very well to the COVID-19 outbreak. We were very early to implement key safety protocols for our employees in our lab, which has continued running at a high capacity with no disruptions. And we were able to scale our remote ordering capabilities to new levels as we\u2019ve seen record demand for this service in March and April. The ability to maintain high-quality monitoring of patients away from medical facilities expands the clinical utility of our suite of tests to help patients get the care they need during this crisis. We were also pleased to see that coverage for average risk NIPT has been expanded during this time by an additional 20 million lives. We\u2019ve seen positive additional reimbursement from this change already and we will continue to make the case to more large payers that are not yet covering NIPT for all women. As many of you are already aware, we completed a $279 million convertible debt financing in March. The notes have a seven-year maturity and a 2.25% interest rate. We used about $79 million of the proceeds to pay down our senior secured order debt credit facility, which we had put in place when the share price was in the single-digit and it had a roughly 11% coupon. So we think, we\u2019ve improved the balance sheet with that deal and also added about $200 million in cash to further bolster our cash position. The next slide shows more details of our performance in the quarter. We continue to see volume growth across both Horizon carrier screening and Panorama NIPT, as we delivered the largest sequential unit growth in company history. We believe Natera is now the clear market leader by volume and NIPT testing, with more than 2 million commercial tests performed. We have published on significantly more NIPT cases than any other company. We have a highly technically differentiated product, and we now have multiple unique clinical features that are unmatched by our competitors. Our strategy to combine our differentiated product with an extreme focus on user experience, distributed through a highly trained direct commercial channel is working very well. Despite the impact of COVID-19, revenues and gross margins were also a record, and this is largely due to the volume growth and improvement we\u2019ve seen in our ASPs. The next slide shows our historical revenue trajectory over a longer time horizon. We had set a long-term goal of revenue acceleration, driven by new products, ASP improvements and volume growth. We\u2019ve clearly been able to drive that acceleration in our revenue in the last four quarters or so. With meaningful contributions from Prospera in transplant and Signatera in oncology still ahead of us, we feel like we are very well positioned to come out the other side of the COVID-19 crisis in a strong long-term position. The next slide summarizes our response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared to many in the industry, we think, we are weathering this disruption well. We\u2019ve kept continuity of operations in our lab and we\u2019ve been able to fulfill record demand for our mobile ordering and mobile blood draw capability. For physicians that care for pregnant women, transplant patients and cancer patients, we offer a web-based platform that allows the doctor to order the test completely remotely. Patients can then schedule a mobile visit, their blood draw will be performed at their house by a qualified phlebotomists and the blood is then sent to our lab like normal. We\u2019ve been working on this application for years, as we handled roughly 10,000 mobile blood draws in 2019. Although the majority of our reproductive health orders are still coming through the usual office channel, we\u2019ve been really pleased with how smoothly this increase in demand has been handled. As we discussed, when we announced our preliminary results for the quarter, we experienced about a 15% drop between the average weekly volume in the first 10 weeks of the quarter, compared to the last two weeks of March. The drop was not 15% across the Board. Part of this were volumes from outbreak hotspots like New York and New Jersey and volumes from our in-vitro fertilization channel. IVF clinics were effectively presented \u2013 prevented from initiating new patients, but these are very determined customers. So we expect a rebound when our clinics can fully reopen again. In fact, just recently, the relevant professional society, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, reaffirmed the essential importance of timely access to fertility treatment, paving the way for a gradual resumption of patient care. There was obviously a lot of confusion around these lockdown orders in late March, and we are already starting to see that the volume is recovering in April, as doctors and patients get back on schedule and make adjustments. Having said all that, we withdrew our guide for the year, specifically because the cadence of the recovery is hard to forecast. As I mentioned at the top of the call, we did see some significant movement on the average risk coverage front. In response to the COVID outbreak, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine posted updated practice suggestions, noting that physicians could consider using cell-free DNA testing in lieu of additional ultrasound tests. Days later, Aetna updated their coverage policy to temporarily cover NIPT for all women. This represents a significant increase in covered lives, and we think these moves bode well for the continued adoption of NIPT as a standard of care for all women in the future. As we mentioned before, we are not getting paid on a large portion of the average risk NIPTs we perform today. Hitting full coverage on an ongoing basis can have a very meaningful impact on our gross profit. We estimate from the volume we do today alone, full average risk coverage would be worth, roughly $60 million in gross profit, and that figure does not include the significant uptick in volume from deeper penetration into the very large average risk market. Okay. On now to the details of our unit economics, ASPs and COGS. For those of you that might be new to Natera earnings calls, we track these metrics carefully to measure our progress towards cash flow break-even for the reproductive health business and along with our volume and revenue growth, we consider these key metrics for measuring our execution. We are really pleased to have good news on both ASPs and COGS this quarter, as you can see on the page. On ASPs, recall that we initially guided 2020 revenues with the assumption that ASPs were going to modestly decline this year. As we said in March, this was largely out of conservatism, but we\u2019ve been pleased to continue to drive ASPs higher in Q1. This is largely due to improving the fraction of time payers reimburse their contracted REIT with us. As long as the underlying payer environment remains relatively stable, we think ASPs can also remain stable, especially because the expanded average risk coverage I described did not come into effect soon enough to meaningfully impact Q1. The drop in COGS was due to R&D initiatives executed in 2019, and lab and supply chain efficiencies, plus the rapid increase in volume we experienced in the quarter. Those of you have who have followed us for years, know that we often report lower COGS per unit in Q1, because the lab runs extra lean to get the job done in the immediate term when faced with higher volumes. We expect COGS per unit to be higher than this level in Q2, partly because volumes will be lower over the same fixed base and we have implemented some COVID-19-specific measures like Hazard Pay for employees that we expect to temporarily affect COGS. Having said that, these Q1 numbers did not include the COGS projects being launched during 2020 that we previously described. And I think, the Q1 performance, coupled with the COGS project, we intend to launch over the next 12 months, shows that we can push this number beyond the $200 threshold over time. Okay. Now on to organ transplant. During our Early Access Program, we\u2019ve seen significant interest from the top transplant centers. We\u2019ve said for a long time that our unique product offering, which has best-in-class sensitivity and negative predictive values, including the ability to identify the important T-cell mediated rejection would be seen as a welcomed alternative for the transplant community. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen. In very short order, we\u2019ve now seen roughly 45% of the top 50 centers place orders and 37% of the top 100 centers by volume place orders. This is really incredible and shows the need for a test like ours in the market. The strong response we\u2019ve seen thus far, indicates the long-term potential of our ability to penetrate this market. We are also seeing strong enrollment in our ProActive trial. As a reminder, ProActive will follow 3,000 kidney transplant patients over a three to five-year period to examine the utility of Prospera to accurately identify organ rejection. In a very short time, we\u2019ve activated 18 of the leading centers, with many more coming online soon, and we\u2019ve already enrolled 145 patients. This is exciting and has outpaced our expectations. Although, the COVID-19 pandemic obviously impacted our ramp, we\u2019re seeing volume growth again, in part, due to an interest in remote monitoring. And over the long-term, we\u2019re excited about building a significant business within transplant space. The next slide is just the same chart that we have shown, since we announced the presentation of our validation data. We\u2019ve hit every milestone toward a commercial launch on time. We think we\u2019ve demonstrated in our early access phase that we can scale the volume and are just awaiting the Noridian LCD before we can start billing Medicare. As a reminder, Noridian polished the guidance of the MolDx program, where we\u2019ve already received a positive coverage and we expect Noridian\u2019s final coverage decision to come in soon. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Solomon for an updated \u2013 update on our progress in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. On the partnership front, our work continues under our development programs with both BGI and Foundation Medicine. And in both partnerships, we expect initial engagement from pharmaceutical clients this year. In our direct pharma business, we continue to see a very good momentum in terms of contracted future revenues, including prospective clinical trials, as well as retrospective studies using bank samples. In the direct clinical business, as we\u2019ve described previously, we hired the first phase of sales reps for Signatera late last year and we started an Early Access Program with top academic institutions, now having worked with the majority of the top NCCN centers. We are pleased with our early trajectory in Q1. And although, the ramp was impacted due to COVID-19, we\u2019ve also received significant interest in using Signatera as a way to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic. We are now seeing volumes start to grow, again, in April. Cancer care has been significantly disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. As cancer patients are at elevated risk from exposure, many standard surveillance visits and CT scans have been canceled. Doctors are looking for remote monitoring solutions and many are reevaluating the risk benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy, which can weaken the immune system. An article published last month in JAMA about oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic actually called out early-stage colorectal cancer specifically, as an example of where adjuvant treatment can be adjusted in the new environment. We think Signatera can really help in these scenarios, as summarized on this slide with our adjuvant and surveillance programs for Stage II and III colorectal cancer and especially with our remote blood draw capability. As we\u2019ve described previously, we believe this clinical indication has the opportunity to translate to over 1 million tests per year, which gives you a sense of the size of these oncology markets, we\u2019re just beginning to unlock. The utility of Signatera was highlighted recently in a new peer-reviewed case report, published in JCO Precision Oncology, demonstrating the technology\u2019s capabilities and yet another type of GI cancer, this time in esophageal cancer. This study, which was published by co-authors from Harvard University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, followed a 72-year old man, with recurrent Stage III esophageal cancer, whose recurrence was detected 350 days before radiographic imaging. After undergoing multiple CT scans, showing no signs of cancer, the patient\u2019s physicians escalated to a PET scan, which revealed a four-centimeter nodule in his liver, that was later surgically removed. Furthermore, the bespoke assay in this case was designed, based off of a FoundationOne tissue test that had already been ordered as part of the patient\u2019s standard care, exactly the way we envisioned the partnership working. We\u2019re very pleased about this demonstration of the potential of our technology and on the proof of principle for our collaboration with Foundation Medicine. We also continue to expand our leadership position with validation data in MRD testing applications. For the first time, we and our collaborators were awarded an oral presentation at ASCO, with an expanded data set in early-stage colorectal cancer. ASCO is holding a virtual meeting this year, and we look forward to presenting this data, along with three other accepted posters. We also have an oral presentation coming up at ESMO GI, later this year and posters at multiple conferences in 2020. On the publication front, in addition to the five papers that we have already published, we have four papers currently in submission, including a pan-cancer set of patients, treated with immunotherapy in the INSPIRE study and the ISPY-2 data in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer. Meanwhile, we have new cohorts from at least five different cancer types, currently undergoing analysis in our laboratory, which we plan to use to drive future publications. This flow of new data will help unlock additional clinical indications and support the growth of our pharma business, where studies range across many different cancer types. Some of the data expect this year will actually be presented in collaboration with some of our pharma clients. All of this is in addition to the prospective trials, that we announced previously in colorectal cancer, I\u2019m not going to go into the details on all of these studies, again, but new investors can still find our prepared remarks from past events on our website. The key update here is that we\u2019re still moving forward on all of these trials. And in the second quarter of this year, we are scheduled to enroll the first patients for both the CIRCULATE-IDEA trial in Japan and our own BESPOKE CRC trial. Finally, we\u2019re still on track to receive the final coverage decision for Medicare in the second-half of this year, as we\u2019ve discussed previously. The public comment period ended in Q4 of last year, which went smoothly and there\u2019s generally a 12-month window in which Medicare would publish the final LCD. We\u2019re also in active discussions with Medicare on coverage for new indications, and I look forward to sharing more details on that in the future. Now, I\u2019m going to hand the call over to Mike to review the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. You can see the summary results for the quarter on the slide. As Steve mentioned earlier in the call, we came in at $94 million for the quarter, which is above the preannounce we gave in April. The key driver for the additional revenue above the preannouncement was additional cash receipts for tests that we reported out in prior periods. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we are pleased to see our approach to revenue accruals for quarters in 2018 to 2019 has proven to be conservative and cash collections for those periods continue to exceed expectations. As Steve described, the revenue and gross margin performance was primarily driven by strong volume growth and continued improvement on both ASPs and COGS. We made progress with both BGI and SMI, and that revenue recognition contributed to the quarter, but that partnership revenue was slightly lower in Q1 versus Q4 of 2019. We are pleased that the reimbursement environment has remained stable so far this year and we are cautiously optimistic that we can maintain this performance through the balance of the year. We do expect COGS to move up, as Steve mentioned, from this low level in the next few quarters, as we deal with the additional expenses related to ensuring our lab is safe and productive and as we expand capacity. But I think, this quarter demonstrates we can get blended cost to goods sold per unit below $200 over time, particularly for the reproductive health business, which currently makes up the vast majority of our volumes. On the operating expenses front, we saw increases over last year, as expected, as we ramp the commercial and clinical trial effort in both transplant and oncology. Expenses in the reproductive health business remains stable, even as volumes continue to ramp. So that demonstrates to us that our path to cash flow break-even in that part of the business is achievable when the world gets a little more back to normal and we can resume growing volumes. As you know, we went through the guide for the year, given the unknowns around the COVID-19 situation, and Steve gave some color on where, specifically, we are being impacted. While the preliminary data on weekly received units in April and early May looks encouraging, we think it is too early for us to forecast precisely when we can return to growing volumes. So we certainly expect that to happen this year, based on everything we know today. With the convert deal now done and the overbed note retired, we feel we are in a very strong cash position, and we\u2019ll be able to execute on our plans despite this COVID-19 disruption. With that, let me hand the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, consistent with what you talked about earlier, in the last two weeks of the quarter, you saw a drop versus Q4 weekly levels of around 15%. You\u2019ve talked about seeing some improvement since then. So just to try to unpack that a little bit more. Q2 volume is typically lower than Q1, but you had a lot of momentum through the first 10 weeks of Q1. If it weren\u2019t for COVID, would you still have expected Q2 volume to be lower than Q1? That\u2019s the first part. Second part is, how much better has volume been since the end of Q1? And then the third part is, in hindsight, as you\u2019ve tried to dissect this a little bit more, was the 15% drop versus trends likely a function of the population density and presumably your market concentration in certain hotspots? And is the improvement, since a function of not just your response, but also the fact that as new hotspots have popped up, maybe you don\u2019t have as much exposure?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Doug. This is Steve. So I\u2019ll just clarify. What we said in the prepared remarks is the last two weeks of March were down about 15% from the average in the first 10 weeks of the quarter. As you know, that sort of first 10-week period was a blowout record period of time for us. So the drop is roughly from sort of 15% of that and it was roughly in line with our Q4 weekly volume average. We have seen the business recover actually quite nicely in April. But it varies somewhat, depending on which segment of the business you\u2019re looking at and which region you\u2019re looking at. So as we mentioned, some of the harder hit areas like IVF, for example, although, the outlook is positive, as we\u2019ve seen this new statement come out from ASRM that they\u2019ve loosened the guidelines a little bit, we\u2019re still waiting to see that come in, as appointments get rescheduled. Other areas of the business were actually back to peak levels or in certain segments, we\u2019ve actually now exceeded the previous peak levels. So we\u2019re feeling good about the recovery and good about the trajectory in April. I do think, the ability to go out and close raw new customers has impacted somewhat. And so while we\u2019re getting back the business that we lost, I do think, certain customers we will be able to close and we have seen that occur. I do think, in general, the sort of pipeline of closing a lot of new business is pushed out slightly.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And in terms of new practice openings, I would think that would be a little more challenging right now, just given it\u2019s harder to get in front of practices. So is most of your growth right now, most of your volume kind of same stores versus new volumes? And if so, is that something that we should be cognizant of, maybe not for Q2, but as we think about second-half trajectory?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Well, look, I mean, I do think, we\u2019ve definitely seen some signs that we can close new customers in this environment, and we have put a lot of effort into digital activities like many others have, and we\u2019ve set up this very slick mobile phlebotomy capability. And in certain areas, oncology and organ transplant, for example, I think, it\u2019s very helpful for those patients to not have to go into the office. So we are seeing some new accounts come on, where they\u2019re interested, particularly in the mobile capabilities or the ability to monitor patients remotely. I think, our first goal was to get \u2013 build back up the existing accounts and same-store sales. And then at the same time go out and look for new customers that may want access to the service. So we\u2019ve seen both occur, new customers close and the base business coming back. But I do think \u2013 comparing it to an environment, where there\u2019s no COVID pandemic, certainly the ramp of closing new customers is not going to be the same, as it would be if we were full steam ahead, reps walking into offices every day. So we can close new business and we are, but it\u2019s not going to be at the same pace that you would have seen otherwise. Mike, would you also want to add anything to that? Yes. Mike, Solomon, anything to add?\nMichael Brophy: No. I think you covered it.\nDoug Schenkel: And then last one for me. Any discussion with some of the payers that have moved to temporarily expand NIPT coverage into average risk patients that would suggest these decisions could be made permanent?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. I mean \u2013 so thanks for the questions. The coverage policies that we\u2019ve seen come out have had explicit addendums to them, linking them to the coronavirus outbreak and they\u2019re limited in their time duration. So there\u2019s nothing in the document that would tell you that it\u2019s going to go on for an extended period of time. But we\u2019ve just got to see. I mean, I think, it\u2019s instructive that the expansion and coverage policies seem to come right on the heels of additional practice recommendations from the professional societies. And so I think, while we don\u2019t know, I think, we would expect that those kind of coverage policies would follow the professional society recommendations. So it\u2019s possible that it could continue.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nEleni Apostolatos: Hey, this is Eleni on for Tycho. Thanks for taking our questions. So firstly, I was wondering, if you can help frame the Aetna opportunity. You mentioned that today, you\u2019re seeing about $60 million in unreimbursed gross profit from average risk volumes. Just wondering, if that includes Aetna or what piece of that was Aetna? And of the remainder, how much is United?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Mike, why don\u2019t you take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Sure. So just as background, there\u2019s about 210 million covered lives \u2013 commercial covered lives in the United States. About 110 million of those lives already had a policy covering average risk NIPT. And of the remaining, Aetna is circa 20 million, 25 million covered lives. And United is bigger, they\u2019re more in the 40 million to 45 million covered lives range depending on how you count some of their ancillary plans. So if you think about Aetna as a percentage of the total commercial covered lives, they\u2019re circa 10% of the commercial lives in the United States. And I think, that\u2019s a reasonably good approximation of their impact on our business. So it\u2019s a \u2013 certainly, it\u2019s a tailwind for us. It\u2019s not an enormous change in our ASP trajectory, but it\u2019s certainly a contributor. The balance of the commercial covered lives for average risk really is kind of a long tail. I mean, you\u2019ve got Humana, maybe the next biggest one, and then it gets into an assortment of the loose plans, et cetera. So it\u2019s a good contributor and it\u2019s not the majority. You can see from my remarks that United is obviously quite a bit bigger.\nEleni Apostolatos: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I was also wondering, in terms of the question of whether Aetna\u2019s temporary policy could be a precursor for a permanent plan, whether you could comment on what we could see come out over the next review of Aetna\u2019s policy, which is, I believe, scheduled for May 8? And whether you\u2019ve had any conversations with them after the temporary policy was released?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I\u2019ll comment on that. So generally, when you have these discussions with the plans, they keep the information flow pretty limited. They don\u2019t want to give away anything, I mean, public companies, et cetera. So you don\u2019t get exact road map. We do feel positive long-term with all of these large payers. They generally tend to follow the professional societies. We\u2019ve said before that we heard that there\u2019s something positive coming from ACOG. We continue to hear that. In fact, we\u2019ve heard that, again, more recently and there\u2019s something drafted that\u2019s going to be released in the near future, that\u2019s positive. We don\u2019t know what it says and we don\u2019t know exactly when it\u2019s going to come out, but we do know that that\u2019s there in the background. I also mentioned sort of backstopping all of this is the SMART study. So if you remember the details of the SMART study, Natera prospectively studied 20,000 patients, over a period of several years. I think, the trial started roughly five years ago, and we expect that data to be published later this year. And we think that will actually be the largest prospective NIPT study, looking at both chromosomal aneuploidy and microdeletions that\u2019s ever been done in the field of NIPT. And we think that study has a very significant opportunity to move the market and the rest of the way forward, if we\u2019re not there by then. With respect to Aetna and United and others specifically, obviously, we\u2019re doing everything we can to engage with them and move the business forward, but we really don\u2019t know exactly what their plans are going to say. We expect them to track the society guidelines.\nEleni Apostolatos: Thanks. And then lastly, I was wondering, also in terms of the delays you\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks of March. Just wondering, specific to NIPT, how much it can be postponed due to the seven-week testing window for NIPT? And if you can talk about whether some of those patients could come back sooner rather than later, and any other dynamics we could see there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I definitely think, there\u2019s a period of time where everyone would sort of figure it out how they were going to manage that last couple of weeks in March. And we sort of see that as probably the worst period of time for disruption on the business. And I think, across every sector of our business, whether it\u2019s the different products in prenatal or whether it\u2019s transplant or oncology, we have seen the volume recover in a pretty meaningful way, since that low in the last two weeks of March. Now some of that is \u2013 practice is figuring out how they\u2019re going to operate in this environment and then pushing the play button and restarting. Some of that is us going out and closing new customers or enrolling new customers in our mobile and remote solutions, and then some of it is catch up on patients. We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we\u2019ve gone through and looked at gestational ages and things, and we haven\u2019t seen a big bolus of catch-up patients come back in on the NIPT front. But I don\u2019t think that they were pushed out significantly, such that there would be a very meaningful shift in the average gestational age anyway.\nEleni Apostolatos: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Max Masucci with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nMax Masucci: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Are you seeing any evidence of share gains in NIPT, as certain larger competitors are sort of inundated with COVID-19 testing? And do you have any expectations there? I know, we\u2019ve seen the large central labs report sharp volume declines for lab testing that\u2019s not related to COVID-19?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Certainly, we\u2019ve been in a very competitive environment for a long time. I mean, I think, as you all know, we were the fourth NIPT to market. We\u2019re now the market leader. So a lot of our growth does come from volume gains or competitive wins. I think, many of the smaller, more targeted competitors are offering the same sort of mobile type capabilities that we\u2019re offering. I\u2019m not sure, necessarily, whether the big box laboratories are going after it in that same way. I\u2019m sure, they will, if they\u2019re not already. But we\u2019re continuing to win on the quality of our product and the unique differentiators and our significant focus on user experience. The advantage for us, as we entered into this period was that, we already had all these remote services set up. So remote genetic counseling. We have chat bots, that can talk to the patient in various ways that we built in-house. We didn\u2019t go out and acquire those capabilities. We just built them. We did more than 10,000 mobile draws in 2019. So as we saw that significant ramp in mobile accessibility being requested from our physicians, we were able to step in and service it without a lot of operational challenges.\nMax Masucci: Great. And then can you just maybe speak to any COVID-19 disruption you\u2019re seeing with the major max, namely Noridian, and how that shaped your opinion about the timing of the finalization for Signatera colon? And then any new color you might have gotten recently around pricing, or are you still expecting to be pegged to an existing monitoring test on the market? Thanks.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we\u2019re in constant contact with the MolDx program. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve done pre-submissions on other products in the oncology space, which we\u2019re very excited about, and we\u2019re continuing to have those discussions about additional products. Certainly, I think, there\u2019s a lot to focus on at this point. By the various max, there\u2019s generally a timeline to which they need to issue the final coverage decision and we expect oncology to issue within that time line that\u2019s been outlined. We don\u2019t expect there to be any sort of significant disruption. And again, we continue to be in direct discussions with the key decision makers and we\u2019re feeling very positive about not only the colorectal test, but also the discussions that we\u2019re having about other products in oncology. On pricing, we don\u2019t have any additional updates at this point. We expect that to occur after the final MolDx coverage decision goes in place.\nMax Masucci: Great Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nWilliam Fafinski: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. This is actually Will Fafinski on for Alex here. Thanks for taking the questions. First one for me, on transplants, you recently published the progress of the ProActive study, showing enrollment among sites. How is Prospera being used beyond the registry trial? Meaning doctors who weren\u2019t enrolling for the registry study, how is the test adoption there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we haven\u2019t announced volume numbers there, but we did talk about the penetration. I think, we said 45% of the top 50 transplant centers by volume and 37% of the top 100 transplant centers by volume have used the product during the Early Access Program. Some of those are engaged in ProActive. I mean, you can just kind of run the math and figure out which ones are ProActive or not, but there\u2019s many that are outside of ProActive that are using the test. And we see really a handful of different types of accounts. I think, some have specific patient cohorts that they want to order donor-derived testing on. I think, some want to order it more routinely, as part of their patient care. But overall, we believe this is a very large market opportunity, that\u2019s only about 5% penetrated today. Despite all of the \u2013 I think, competitive activity between us and others in the field, there\u2019s an enormous amount of greenfield opportunity when you just run the numbers on the total number of patients that need to be monitored per year. So we feel excited about it. The early feedback that we\u2019ve gotten from physicians really meets our expectations, both and what they\u2019re looking for in a product. And second, in the capability to really penetrate and make this much larger than 5%.\nWilliam Fafinski: Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then second one for me. Mike, Natera obviously followed the approach of other companies and suspended guidance at this time. But just with the temporary coverage of Aetna, the potential UNH, share gains during COVID, ability to keep some sales with remote monitoring and is the pipeline is still on track? Is it fair to say that you could still hit the original guidance range that you guys provided at the beginning of the year?\nMichael Brophy: It\u2019s certainly possible. But Steve touched on one of the key variables, which is new account starts. And historically, in diagnostics, you just need a sales rep to be in the office or in the center with the physician to get a new account started. And obviously, physicians are much more accommodating to remote startups now than they had been previously. But that\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s very hard for us to forecast. And so as we look at it right now, we think, it\u2019s wise just to monitor that. And over the course of the summer, we would like to get to more data points, honestly, with this new environment and then come back to you in August.\nWilliam Fafinski: Got it. Understood. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further questions.\nSteve Chapman: Great. Well, thank you so much. We appreciate you joining. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, we're still on track to receive the final coverage decision for Medicare in the second-half of this year, as we've discussed previously. The public comment period ended in Q4 of last year, which went smoothly and there's generally a 12-month window in which Medicare would publish the final LCD. We're also in active discussions with Medicare on coverage for new indications, and I look forward to sharing more details on that in the future. Now, I'm going to hand the call over to Mike to review the financials. Mike?"

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're going to review the highlights from the quarter, summarize the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and our response and give you an update on our clinical and commercial progress in transplant and oncology. On to the highlights. We posted $94 million in revenues and a 52% gross margin in the quarter, which is by far the best quarter we've ever had as a company and significantly above the range of $89 million to $91 million we preannounced. Q1 was the largest sequential quarter-on-quarter unit growth in the company's history, despite the disruption in March from COVID-19. Revenues grew 41% over Q1 2019, driven by the strong volumes and another positive quarter for average selling prices. We were also very pleased to achieve a cost of goods sold of $202 per unit accessioned in our lab, very close to the $200 per unit level, we had set as a long-term target. I will spend more time on both ASP and COGS later in the call. We also witnessed a very successful early launch of our Prospera test in the kidney transplant space. In a very short timeframe, we saw orders from 45% of the top 50 and 37% of the top 100 transplant centers by volume. We also activated 18 top centers in the ProActive registry trial, enrolling 145 patients. We think these exceptional initial results indicate significant interest for a more accurate donor-derived cell-free DNA test. We also responded very well to the COVID-19 outbreak. We were very early to implement key safety protocols for our employees in our lab, which has continued running at a high capacity with no disruptions. And we were able to scale our remote ordering capabilities to new levels as we've seen record demand for this service in March and April. The ability to maintain high-quality monitoring of patients away from medical facilities expands the clinical utility of our suite of tests to help patients get the care they need during this crisis. We were also pleased to see that coverage for average risk NIPT has been expanded during this time by an additional 20 million lives. We've seen positive additional reimbursement from this change already and we will continue to make the case to more large payers that are not yet covering NIPT for all women. As many of you are already aware, we completed a $279 million convertible debt financing in March. The notes have a seven-year maturity and a 2.25% interest rate. We used about $79 million of the proceeds to pay down our senior secured order debt credit facility, which we had put in place when the share price was in the single-digit and it had a roughly 11% coupon. So we think, we've improved the balance sheet with that deal and also added about $200 million in cash to further bolster our cash position. The next slide shows more details of our performance in the quarter. We continue to see volume growth across both Horizon carrier screening and Panorama NIPT, as we delivered the largest sequential unit growth in company history. We believe Natera is now the clear market leader by volume and NIPT testing, with more than 2 million commercial tests performed. We have published on significantly more NIPT cases than any other company. We have a highly technically differentiated product, and we now have multiple unique clinical features that are unmatched by our competitors. Our strategy to combine our differentiated product with an extreme focus on user experience, distributed through a highly trained direct commercial channel is working very well. Despite the impact of COVID-19, revenues and gross margins were also a record, and this is largely due to the volume growth and improvement we've seen in our ASPs. The next slide shows our historical revenue trajectory over a longer time horizon. We had set a long-term goal of revenue acceleration, driven by new products, ASP improvements and volume growth. We've clearly been able to drive that acceleration in our revenue in the last four quarters or so. With meaningful contributions from Prospera in transplant and Signatera in oncology still ahead of us, we feel like we are very well positioned to come out the other side of the COVID-19 crisis in a strong long-term position. The next slide summarizes our response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared to many in the industry, we think, we are weathering this disruption well. We've kept continuity of operations in our lab and we've been able to fulfill record demand for our mobile ordering and mobile blood draw capability. For physicians that care for pregnant women, transplant patients and cancer patients, we offer a web-based platform that allows the doctor to order the test completely remotely. Patients can then schedule a mobile visit, their blood draw will be performed at their house by a qualified phlebotomists and the blood is then sent to our lab like normal. We've been working on this application for years, as we handled roughly 10,000 mobile blood draws in 2019. Although the majority of our reproductive health orders are still coming through the usual office channel, we've been really pleased with how smoothly this increase in demand has been handled. As we discussed, when we announced our preliminary results for the quarter, we experienced about a 15% drop between the average weekly volume in the first 10 weeks of the quarter, compared to the last two weeks of March. The drop was not 15% across the Board. Part of this were volumes from outbreak hotspots like New York and New Jersey and volumes from our in-vitro fertilization channel. IVF clinics were effectively presented \u2013 prevented from initiating new patients, but these are very determined customers. So we expect a rebound when our clinics can fully reopen again. In fact, just recently, the relevant professional society, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, reaffirmed the essential importance of timely access to fertility treatment, paving the way for a gradual resumption of patient care. There was obviously a lot of confusion around these lockdown orders in late March, and we are already starting to see that the volume is recovering in April, as doctors and patients get back on schedule and make adjustments. Having said all that, we withdrew our guide for the year, specifically because the cadence of the recovery is hard to forecast. As I mentioned at the top of the call, we did see some significant movement on the average risk coverage front. In response to the COVID outbreak, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine posted updated practice suggestions, noting that physicians could consider using cell-free DNA testing in lieu of additional ultrasound tests. Days later, Aetna updated their coverage policy to temporarily cover NIPT for all women. This represents a significant increase in covered lives, and we think these moves bode well for the continued adoption of NIPT as a standard of care for all women in the future. As we mentioned before, we are not getting paid on a large portion of the average risk NIPTs we perform today. Hitting full coverage on an ongoing basis can have a very meaningful impact on our gross profit. We estimate from the volume we do today alone, full average risk coverage would be worth, roughly $60 million in gross profit, and that figure does not include the significant uptick in volume from deeper penetration into the very large average risk market. Okay. On now to the details of our unit economics, ASPs and COGS. For those of you that might be new to Natera earnings calls, we track these metrics carefully to measure our progress towards cash flow break-even for the reproductive health business and along with our volume and revenue growth, we consider these key metrics for measuring our execution. We are really pleased to have good news on both ASPs and COGS this quarter, as you can see on the page. On ASPs, recall that we initially guided 2020 revenues with the assumption that ASPs were going to modestly decline this year. As we said in March, this was largely out of conservatism, but we've been pleased to continue to drive ASPs higher in Q1. This is largely due to improving the fraction of time payers reimburse their contracted REIT with us. As long as the underlying payer environment remains relatively stable, we think ASPs can also remain stable, especially because the expanded average risk coverage I described did not come into effect soon enough to meaningfully impact Q1. The drop in COGS was due to R&D initiatives executed in 2019, and lab and supply chain efficiencies, plus the rapid increase in volume we experienced in the quarter. Those of you have who have followed us for years, know that we often report lower COGS per unit in Q1, because the lab runs extra lean to get the job done in the immediate term when faced with higher volumes. We expect COGS per unit to be higher than this level in Q2, partly because volumes will be lower over the same fixed base and we have implemented some COVID-19-specific measures like Hazard Pay for employees that we expect to temporarily affect COGS. Having said that, these Q1 numbers did not include the COGS projects being launched during 2020 that we previously described. And I think, the Q1 performance, coupled with the COGS project, we intend to launch over the next 12 months, shows that we can push this number beyond the $200 threshold over time. Okay. Now on to organ transplant. During our Early Access Program, we've seen significant interest from the top transplant centers. We've said for a long time that our unique product offering, which has best-in-class sensitivity and negative predictive values, including the ability to identify the important T-cell mediated rejection would be seen as a welcomed alternative for the transplant community. That's exactly what we've seen. In very short order, we've now seen roughly 45% of the top 50 centers place orders and 37% of the top 100 centers by volume place orders. This is really incredible and shows the need for a test like ours in the market. The strong response we've seen thus far, indicates the long-term potential of our ability to penetrate this market. We are also seeing strong enrollment in our ProActive trial. As a reminder, ProActive will follow 3,000 kidney transplant patients over a three to five-year period to examine the utility of Prospera to accurately identify organ rejection. In a very short time, we've activated 18 of the leading centers, with many more coming online soon, and we've already enrolled 145 patients. This is exciting and has outpaced our expectations. Although, the COVID-19 pandemic obviously impacted our ramp, we're seeing volume growth again, in part, due to an interest in remote monitoring. And over the long-term, we're excited about building a significant business within transplant space. The next slide is just the same chart that we have shown, since we announced the presentation of our validation data. We've hit every milestone toward a commercial launch on time. We think we've demonstrated in our early access phase that we can scale the volume and are just awaiting the Noridian LCD before we can start billing Medicare. As a reminder, Noridian polished the guidance of the MolDx program, where we've already received a positive coverage and we expect Noridian's final coverage decision to come in soon. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Solomon for an updated \u2013 update on our progress in oncology. Solomon? Yes. Thanks, Doug. This is Steve. So I'll just clarify. What we said in the prepared remarks is the last two weeks of March were down about 15% from the average in the first 10 weeks of the quarter. As you know, that sort of first 10-week period was a blowout record period of time for us. So the drop is roughly from sort of 15% of that and it was roughly in line with our Q4 weekly volume average. We have seen the business recover actually quite nicely in April. But it varies somewhat, depending on which segment of the business you're looking at and which region you're looking at. So as we mentioned, some of the harder hit areas like IVF, for example, although, the outlook is positive, as we've seen this new statement come out from ASRM that they've loosened the guidelines a little bit, we're still waiting to see that come in, as appointments get rescheduled. Other areas of the business were actually back to peak levels or in certain segments, we've actually now exceeded the previous peak levels. So we're feeling good about the recovery and good about the trajectory in April. I do think, the ability to go out and close raw new customers has impacted somewhat. And so while we're getting back the business that we lost, I do think, certain customers we will be able to close and we have seen that occur. I do think, in general, the sort of pipeline of closing a lot of new business is pushed out slightly. Yes. Well, look, I mean, I do think, we've definitely seen some signs that we can close new customers in this environment, and we have put a lot of effort into digital activities like many others have, and we've set up this very slick mobile phlebotomy capability. And in certain areas, oncology and organ transplant, for example, I think, it's very helpful for those patients to not have to go into the office. So we are seeing some new accounts come on, where they're interested, particularly in the mobile capabilities or the ability to monitor patients remotely. I think, our first goal was to get \u2013 build back up the existing accounts and same-store sales. And then at the same time go out and look for new customers that may want access to the service. So we've seen both occur, new customers close and the base business coming back. But I do think \u2013 comparing it to an environment, where there's no COVID pandemic, certainly the ramp of closing new customers is not going to be the same, as it would be if we were full steam ahead, reps walking into offices every day. So we can close new business and we are, but it's not going to be at the same pace that you would have seen otherwise. Mike, would you also want to add anything to that? Yes. Mike, Solomon, anything to add? Yes. Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. Mike, why don't you take that? Yes. I'll comment on that. So generally, when you have these discussions with the plans, they keep the information flow pretty limited. They don't want to give away anything, I mean, public companies, et cetera. So you don't get exact road map. We do feel positive long-term with all of these large payers. They generally tend to follow the professional societies. We've said before that we heard that there's something positive coming from ACOG. We continue to hear that. In fact, we've heard that, again, more recently and there's something drafted that's going to be released in the near future, that's positive. We don't know what it says and we don't know exactly when it's going to come out, but we do know that that's there in the background. I also mentioned sort of backstopping all of this is the SMART study. So if you remember the details of the SMART study, Natera prospectively studied 20,000 patients, over a period of several years. I think, the trial started roughly five years ago, and we expect that data to be published later this year. And we think that will actually be the largest prospective NIPT study, looking at both chromosomal aneuploidy and microdeletions that's ever been done in the field of NIPT. And we think that study has a very significant opportunity to move the market and the rest of the way forward, if we're not there by then. With respect to Aetna and United and others specifically, obviously, we're doing everything we can to engage with them and move the business forward, but we really don't know exactly what their plans are going to say. We expect them to track the society guidelines. Yes. I definitely think, there's a period of time where everyone would sort of figure it out how they were going to manage that last couple of weeks in March. And we sort of see that as probably the worst period of time for disruption on the business. And I think, across every sector of our business, whether it's the different products in prenatal or whether it's transplant or oncology, we have seen the volume recover in a pretty meaningful way, since that low in the last two weeks of March. Now some of that is \u2013 practice is figuring out how they're going to operate in this environment and then pushing the play button and restarting. Some of that is us going out and closing new customers or enrolling new customers in our mobile and remote solutions, and then some of it is catch up on patients. We haven't seen \u2013 we've gone through and looked at gestational ages and things, and we haven't seen a big bolus of catch-up patients come back in on the NIPT front. But I don't think that they were pushed out significantly, such that there would be a very meaningful shift in the average gestational age anyway. Yes. Certainly, we've been in a very competitive environment for a long time. I mean, I think, as you all know, we were the fourth NIPT to market. We're now the market leader. So a lot of our growth does come from volume gains or competitive wins. I think, many of the smaller, more targeted competitors are offering the same sort of mobile type capabilities that we're offering. I'm not sure, necessarily, whether the big box laboratories are going after it in that same way. I'm sure, they will, if they're not already. But we're continuing to win on the quality of our product and the unique differentiators and our significant focus on user experience. The advantage for us, as we entered into this period was that, we already had all these remote services set up. So remote genetic counseling. We have chat bots, that can talk to the patient in various ways that we built in-house. We didn't go out and acquire those capabilities. We just built them. We did more than 10,000 mobile draws in 2019. So as we saw that significant ramp in mobile accessibility being requested from our physicians, we were able to step in and service it without a lot of operational challenges. Yes. So we're in constant contact with the MolDx program. As we've mentioned, we've done pre-submissions on other products in the oncology space, which we're very excited about, and we're continuing to have those discussions about additional products. Certainly, I think, there's a lot to focus on at this point. By the various max, there's generally a timeline to which they need to issue the final coverage decision and we expect oncology to issue within that time line that's been outlined. We don't expect there to be any sort of significant disruption. And again, we continue to be in direct discussions with the key decision makers and we're feeling very positive about not only the colorectal test, but also the discussions that we're having about other products in oncology. On pricing, we don't have any additional updates at this point. We expect that to occur after the final MolDx coverage decision goes in place. Yes. So we haven't announced volume numbers there, but we did talk about the penetration. I think, we said 45% of the top 50 transplant centers by volume and 37% of the top 100 transplant centers by volume have used the product during the Early Access Program. Some of those are engaged in ProActive. I mean, you can just kind of run the math and figure out which ones are ProActive or not, but there's many that are outside of ProActive that are using the test. And we see really a handful of different types of accounts. I think, some have specific patient cohorts that they want to order donor-derived testing on. I think, some want to order it more routinely, as part of their patient care. But overall, we believe this is a very large market opportunity, that's only about 5% penetrated today. Despite all of the \u2013 I think, competitive activity between us and others in the field, there's an enormous amount of greenfield opportunity when you just run the numbers on the total number of patients that need to be monitored per year. So we feel excited about it. The early feedback that we've gotten from physicians really meets our expectations, both and what they're looking for in a product. And second, in the capability to really penetrate and make this much larger than 5%. Great. Well, thank you so much. We appreciate you joining. Take care."

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. 02:39 And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: 02:42 Great. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We've got a packed session full of announcements, so let's get into the recent highlights. 2021 was a breakout year for Natera, volumes were up 53% year-on-year, which is higher than we pre-announced in January by more than 5,000 units. Despite all the disruption in the world from the Omicron variant, volumes were still very strong. We posted another record with 439,000 test process. In addition, this was also one of the largest sequential growth quarters we've ever seen on a net unit basis. 03:21 Revenues were $625.5 million for the full year, above the top end of our November guidance, and more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our regional revenue guide given in February of 2021. Looking at the quarter, once again, Q4 was a very strong revenue quarter as we came in at roughly $173 million. Mike and I will spend more time on the drivers behind these numbers and the remaining financial results shortly. 03:51 In addition to the excellent volume and revenue performance we recently set a new standard for clinical data in the field of cell-free DNA with presentations and publications that can have a very meaningful impact on patient care. First is the recent presentation at the ASCO GI conference from the prospective multisite CIRCULATE trial, which showed that Signatera is predictive of treatment benefit in colorectal cancer. We also showed that Signatera has exceptional sensitivity at the post-surgical time point. This was the largest prospective dataset ever presented using MRD testing in CRC and the first to show MRD testing is predictive of treatment benefit in CRC. 04:36 Second is the publication of the prospective multisite SMART trial in The Gray Journal, which is a leading Journal in Obstetrics and Gynecology. With the SMART trial getting into publication in a top journal, and with over 18,000 patients in the study, this now allows 22q screening to be formally considered for ACOG guidelines inclusion. There is a generally accepted set of criteria required for a disorder to be included in the prenatal testing guidelines and we believe the study results achieved all of the performance metrics required to meet this objective. 05:10 Finally, in Oregon Health, we were able to release very strong large scale prospective data in each heart, lung and kidney transplantation that we think can have a very positive impact when published, for example in kidney, the Trifecta study represents the largest prospective fully biopsy match study conducted to date, with nearly 3 times the number of biopsy match rejections as in DART study, which is one of the larger historical data sets in the space. We are very pleased that Prospera's performance in the study was exceptional, and we'll spend more time in all of these results later in the call. 05:46 Finally, we are pleased to be guiding full-year 2022 total revenues at $770 million to $790 million, which implies roughly 31% proforma revenue growth over 2021 at the midpoint. The guide reflects our usual cautious approach, but there is upside opportunity as we see ourselves entering 2022 strongly positioned for continued growth across our portfolio. 06:13 Okay, let's get into some of the business trends. The next slide is just an annual view of our volume growth over time. We have a long track record of execution which you can see that something different happened in 2021 where we are benefiting from 2 fundamental trends in health care. First, the use of cell-free DNA in Oregon Health and Oncology just getting started and we are a leader in both fields. The volume from cancer products and Oregon Health products are starting to make a significant impact on our growth. 06:41 Second is the increased pace of NIPT adoption in the US, post ACOG guidelines, which drives not only NIPT volumes, but also allows us to offer physicians other tests like carrier screening and 22q. I think our 2021 performance shows we are well-positioned to leverage these trends and we think these are multi-year drivers that we can continue to benefit from in the future. 07:03 Diving into a quarterly view on the next slide shows that the business trends remained very strong in Q4 with total revenue growth outpacing volume growth. In addition, quarterly sequential volume growth was strong at roughly 8%. This was one of the best sequential growth quarters we've ever had in spite of the fact that third quarter in 2021 was unusually strong for us because a large NIPT player exited the space in June and Q4 has fewer [seasoning] (ph) days due to the holidays. 07:35 The underlying ASP performance was strong, although we also had roughly $7 million in cash receipts from prior period true-ups and reserve benefits in Q3, which mutes the reported sequential pricing trends in Q4. $173 million in revenue was also well above expectations and all the growth trends continue to look quite strong so far in Q1. 08:00 On the next slide I'm excited to share a new snapshot of the volume trajectory in our newer products, which as you can see, have been growing rapidly. This is what I mean when I say cell-free DNA is just getting started in oncology transplantation. The left chart is our volume progression in Signatera and Altera in Oncology and the right chart is Prospera and Renasight in Oregon Health. 08:23 In Oncology, the vast majority of these volumes are Signatera units ordered by physicians for clinical use, but this also includes very strong pharma performance. Based on our current run rate and publicly available data, we believe that we're very close to being the overall market leader by volume in the field of liquid biopsy even when including both therapy selection and MRD testing categories. We think this performance is superior to any other MRD test on the market today. In addition, this rapid growth shows how big the MRD opportunity can be. 08:57 We've been able to drive this level of early adoption focusing primarily on colorectal cancer, which we think is still an under-penetrated market. Despite our historical focus on CRC, which represents less than 10% of the overall MRD opportunity, we are starting to see more volume come in from immunotherapy response monitoring in addition to MRD testing in other solid tumors beyond CRC. Some doctors start using Signatera in colorectal cancer and then expand to use it as a multi-cancer tool. This is an advantage of our patient-specific tumor informed assay. The same product can be applied to a broad range of cancer types without designing a new fixed panel for each tumor type. This growth is also impressive, because 2021 was a building year for us with regards to our commercial and operational teams. We've now built a full commercial team that still has a lot of leverage left for growth. 09:51 Paired with that our robust live operations now allow us to scale, as we built out the infrastructure to optimize turnaround times and manage recurrent orders, both of which take time to master. We're in a great position to grow the market, but I think what's most impressive is our data leadership. We've got paradigm-shifting predictive data now in both colorectal and bladder cancers. We have over 100 additional studies underway and it's possible we can publish more than 20 peer-reviewed papers in 2022 alone. In addition, in 2022 we will be receiving repeat testing volume from patients that started on Signatera in 2021, which is when the vast majority of our current patients initiated testing, driving continued growth for us. Overall, we believe we're in a very strong position to expand our leadership here and in the liquid biopsy field. 10:45 In Oregon Health, the majority of our volume in the slide is coming from Prospera orders, but it does also include a meaningful contribution from Renasight. In 2022, we expect added momentum from the publication of the Trifecta study in kidney and we expect meaningful volumes from the contribution of our recent launches in heart and lung resulting from the publication of leading studies in those organs. 11:10 It's worth noting that the commercial and operational infrastructure needed to support years of growth is largely built now, so we have an opportunity to get significant leverage out of our current team as centers adopt donor-derived cell-free DNA testing. You can see from this volume trajectory why we think we are positioned to be a top player in this space for years to come. For now, we will plan on providing the snapshot once annually on the Q4 call in order to preserve competitive positioning. But, I think the 2021 volume show that these are not going to be niche products and we are on the path to achieving scale in these new areas. 11:47 Now, let's move to the second major trend on the next slide. After gaining a full ACOG endorsement in 2020 for NIPT, adoption grew significantly in 2021, even as the overall market for NIPT grew based on our estimates, Panorama actually increased market share. As you can see on the right side of the chart, there is still a long way to go to get anywhere near full adoption. We've estimated that the NIPT market can reach 80% to 90% adoption in the coming years. In addition to growing adoption in the community setting we are seeing growth from large group practices and health systems. For example, we recently just closed a system of over 10 hospitals that's now rolling out NIPT to its patients for the first time. We think that our competitive edge in winning these deals is our significant body of peer-reviewed clinical evidence, our highly differentiated product and our strong suite of user experience tools. For example, we are now fully integrated into leading EMR systems, making it easier for systems to adopt Panorama broadly. 12:53 Additionally, although it's the only state-sponsored prenatal screening program we are aware of in the United States, we think the State of California is likely to expand their existing prenatal screening program from high-risk only in which Natera is already actively participating to now include average risk NIPT. We've been selected to participate in this program, and are currently in discussions with the State. If we do choose to move forward, we'd likely offer a lower-priced offering that screen for a narrower set of conditions, but we think that volume would increase as access is opened up by this program. We've already submitted for a unique PLA code for the more limited offering. In addition, we expect to offer other test in our portfolio like curious screening alongside the program as we enter new OB-GYN offices. 13:45 There are also a lot of key points in the program that are still under discussion, but, we've gone ahead and built this into our forecast, taken a conservative approach to the impact of the change. Across all channels OB-GYN, MSM, Hospital Systems, et cetera, we think Natera remains very well-positioned to extend its leadership position. The other opportunity that we see potentially compounding the value of increasing NIPT adoption is our ability to service the physician for additional tests that are routinely offered early in pregnancy. We think there are substantial growth opportunities here, as our commercial team meets with more and more physicians to also expand our client base for other tests, like genetic carrier screening that ACOG recommends to be offered to all pregnant women regardless of ethnicity or age. Historically, Natera's Carrier screening orders has scaled up together with our NIPT volume and we think that trend will continue. 14:38 Furthermore, we believe screening for the 22q may soon be recommended as part of routine practice, which may further expand the value we can offer to our patients and ordering physicians. More on that topic on the next slide. 14:52 As many of you saw in our press release, the Landmark SMART 22q microdeletions study was recently published in The Gray Journal, which is a premier journal among OB-GYNs in the United States. SMART is by far the largest prospective study to confirm genetic outcomes on all pregnancies in the study. The results were excellent. The incidence of 22q in the study was 1 in 1,524, which confirms 22q is one of the most common prenatal genetic disorders in the general population and unlike trisomy 21 the incidents of the disorder is not impacted by maternal age. 15:30 By comparison, cystic fibrosis, which is screened routinely has an incidence of approximately 1 in 3,500 in the general population, and trisomy\u2019s 18 and 13 have an incidence of 1 in 3,000 and 1 in 5,000, respectively. Panorama test results were accurate, greater than 99.9% of the time, meaning that 99.9% of the time the Panorama result, whether high risk or low risk was confirmed to be correct. For high-risk results only, we had a positive predictive value or PPV of 53%, meaning that more than 1 in 2 pregnancies screening high risk with Panorama were confirmed to be effective using a confirmatory diagnostic test. This is really strong, especially compared to traditional prenatal test like the Quad screen offered routinely to all pregnant women in United States for the past 40 years that have a PPV of only 3.5% or 1 in 29. 16:31 So, the question remaining is, will this be recommended by ACOG for routine screening? Well, we don't control the outcome, but screen tests that offer the most clinical utility need a few criteria. They screen for a serious disorder with high accuracy and high PVV, they catch many cases that are not otherwise captured by the existing standard of care, and early detection provides an opportunity to intervene and improve outcomes. In the case of 22q that means treatment with calcium at birth in order to mitigate potential seizures that can result in cognitive impairment. We think our 22q microdeletions screen, clearly meets all of these criteria. It's common, it's severe, it can be screened for with high accuracy and there is an appropriate intervention. This sets up very nicely for a guideline change, but we will have to see where things end up. 17:21 Okay. Now, let's spend a bit more time on the Organ Health opportunity. You saw the excellent traction we've been getting in Prospera on the earlier slide, and we see a lot of room for future growth. When we presented this slide in 2020, we estimated fewer than 5% of transplant recipients were getting cell-free DNA testing. While that is clearly grown we think this chart shows Prospera can fill a significant unmet need in the coming years. And what we believe is yet another large market opportunity. 17:51 One driver we think can help increase adoption of cell-free DNA in this area is additional large prospective clinical trials that that confirm the excellent performance of Prospera. While we're pleased with the data we generated thus far we know that publishing big prospective trials can really move the needle. Although our volume has been growing nicely, this is probably the biggest objection we faced in the field. So, just as we did in Oncology and Women's Health we've been investing heavily in data generation. Finally, after a ton of work by our team and our outside collaborators, in 2022 we expect a wave of prospective, strong and meaningful data across kidney, heart and lung transplantation and we think this can make a significant impact for us. 18:33 So, first a minute on the Trifecta study in kidney transplantation. This study was led by Dr. Phil Halloran, who is one of the premier researchers in the field. Trifecta had more than 3 times the number of biopsy match rejections than the DART study. Trifecta also enrolled patients from more than 20 US and international sites. You can see that Prospera results from the initial readout were exceptional. The results were so strong that we believe it could eliminate the need for multi-modality testing to rescue test performance. 19:05 Multi-modality testing using RNA and cell-free DNA is very expensive. We think it could cost roughly $6,000 per blood draw compared to Prospera, which is less than half of that price. So we look forward to publishing the Trifecta study this spring and we think it will be a really significant step forward for Prospera adoption. 19:26 We also have 2 studies soon to be published in each of heart and lung transplantation. First-in-one, we were pleased last fall to pre-release data from the largest prospective lung donor-derived cell-free DNA trial to date using our commercially available assay. The data was very strong and accepted for an oral presentation at ISHLT. We look forward to the publication of this paper in the near term. 19:51 Finally in heart, we previously announced the readout of our multi-site study that includes a prospective and retrospective arm. We showed an excellent overall AUC of 0.84 with greater than 250 prospective samples included in the study and greater than 100 retrospective samples for total of greater than 350 overall. In fact the AUC in the prospective arm were slightly higher than retrospective arm. Again, this performance is very strong, it could eliminate the need to perform expensive multimodality test that in the context of heart transplantation require cumbersome specimen processing, for example, spinning down the sample and shipping it on dry ice. 20:33 Okay. Now, let me hand the call over to Solomon to provide an update on oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: 20:39 Thanks, Steve. We're now working across all 3 of these areas on the slide here, for an estimated total addressable market North of $50 billion. Given we just provided an update on the early cancer detection program earlier this year, the key focus of this business update will be on the MRD space and the Signatera opportunity. As many of you know, we've had several major wins recently, so I'm excited to elaborate. 21:06 Let's start with the commercial and operational teams that we have built over the last 18 months or so. Steve touched on the competitive advantage, we think this team is already delivering. And I think the Signatera volumes in 2021 prove that out. The commercial team is now similarly-sized as the big teams from other liquid biopsy players. They've been in place with consistent sales territories for only a couple of quarters. So, we think there is ample room for our team to get more efficient with initiating new clinics and supporting growth within existing accounts. We estimate the commercial team is only at roughly 10% capacity in terms of the number of ordering patients and accounts that they can manage. 21:45 Over the same time, we've also dramatically scaled our operations and launched flexible and intuitive user experience tools for seamless ordering of the test. No other company in this space has ever reached this level of scale with a personalized serial monitoring test. So we've solved a lot of new challenges to get to this point. On lab operations in Q4, we saw a median turnaround time of 19 days for a patient's initial test results, and less than a week for subsequent tests. This means we're delivering test results within a clinically meaningful timeframe to inform adjuvant treatment decisions. Especially since Signatera can be initiated at any time pre or post-surgery, unlike other assays that are indicated only starting at 30 days post-surgery. 22:32 Other laboratories that have ambitions to launch a tumor-informed MRD test will have to solve many of these same operational challenges, but with the added pressure of Signatera already being commercially available. Our suite of user experience tools are also making an impact, which, of course, levers everything we've learned from operating in competitive environment for the last 10 years. The core of this offering are the online portals, EMR integrations, and a customer support infrastructure that is designed to facilitate serial monitoring and can be adjusted to fit the unique evolving needs of every patient. 23:07 As Steve mentioned, we think the strongest components of our offering are the clinical performance of the test itself and the extensive validation data we've already produced and continue to produce across a broad range of cancer types. We expect our lead in data generation to only increase this year. We've now got more than 100 clinical studies on our pipeline, including projects with pharma partners and academic partners that we expect a strong year of peer-reviewed publications as Steve described. 23:35 On the subject of clinical data, we were glad to host many of you for a special call about the data that was presented in January at ASCO GI. The interim readout from CIRCULATE Japan included analysis from over 1,000 patients with 12 months of follow up stratified by MRD status and for the first time also stratified by treatment status, which enabled the predictive claims that we can now make about Signatera in colorectal cancer. I want to just briefly review our results there, and the next steps. 24:05 So the central question for us in CRC has always been, will MRD positive patients benefit from adjuvant treatment? Or are they just destined to recur regardless of treatment? This data clearly shows that Signatera positive patients do benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The green lines in these charts represent Signatera MRD positive patients that received chemotherapy and the blue lines are the MRD positive patients that did not receive chemotherapy. You can see a clear separation of the lines, and the p-values were significant in all stages of disease, even when adjusting for other confounding factors, such as age and lymph node status. 24:45 The hazard ratios here are striking, for example, in the middle chart we see Stage III Signatera positive patients are over 8 times more likely to recur if they are observed instead of getting treated with adjuvant therapy. We know that a significant group of patients that are indicative for chemotherapy today do not actually get treated for a variety of reasons. Now with the support of this interim data, we think it's going to be much more likely that MRD-positive patients choose to pursue chemotherapy. 25:18 Now on the next slide, we address the other side of the coin, with Signatera MRD negative patients benefit from chemotherapy or can they safely avoid chemo, while being serially monitored. You can see from the chart that there is no separation between the lines, which means that Signatera MRD negative patients received no significant treatment benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in this study. Among patients who tested MRD negative at four weeks post-surgery the 12 months survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not statistically significant and it would not be worth for toxicity of chemotherapy. We believe this data could have an immediate impact for thousands of CRC patients, who are already on the borderline about chemotherapy and we look forward to confirming these results in future readouts from the trial. 26:06 In addition to the predictive findings that I just covered, the prognostic data on the assay was also very strong, as we've shown before. Based on the single time point post-surgery disease-free survival at 12 months was 95% for the Signatera negative patients and 55% for the Signatera positive patients, yielding a hazard ratio higher than 13. Signatera sensitivity was 67% at the single time point, which is stronger than what was previously reported in our 2019 paper in JAMA Oncology. Overall, we think this test performance is really exceptional. 26:44 The next slide is an updated snapshot of the addressable patient population in MRD that is built up from estimated tests per year. The short-term eligible population represents indications where we have already generated initial data and have line of sight to gaining Medicare reimbursement over the next 2 years, which we think together can support up to 4 million Signatera tests per year in those indications. This now includes several GI indications outside of colorectal, including pancreatic, gastroesophageal, and anal cancers, where we've recently presented clinical data. 27:18 Looking further out, we think prospective randomized trials may be required to unlock additional indications that, if successful, we believe could support Signatera volumes of up to 13 million test per year. We are already working on generating that data and we expect the first large prospective readouts over the next 3 to 5 years. Because Signatera is personalized and agnostic to tumor type, we have a great opportunity here to leverage the same product in the same commercial channel to drive adoption across all of these indications as it gives significant leverage on our investment. 27:52 Now, let's take a look at the coverage roadmap for the next few years. After receiving the initial MolDX coverage decision in Stage II and III CRC and the subsequent umbrella policy was released, we have been able to rapidly follow up and win coverage in pan-cancer immunotherapy response monitoring and stage IV CRC. We've now submitted additional indications to the MolDx program and we expect additional coverage decisions to come in in 2022 and 2023. Key goal we have over that timeframe is to get into NCCN guidelines. We think the CRC data we presented from CIRCULATE Japan, once it's peer-reviewed and published merits consideration for guideline inclusion. 28:34 The ASCO guideline update last December specifically referenced ctDNA as an emerging potential predictive factor and it anticipated that forthcoming prospective data could merit inclusion in an upcoming future guideline. We have now generated that predictive data and will further support that effort with additional readouts from CIRCULATE as well as data coming soon from BESPOKE, our prospective registry trial in CRC. 29:01 We will take a similar approach with the other cancer types as well, generating additional evidence to support clinical utility across each of them. Although, we feel good about our chances for NCCN guideline inclusion, it is ultimately outside of our control. So, we do remain cautious in terms of the potential impact in our guide for this year. 29:21 Now, let me hand over the call to Mike to discuss the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: 29:27 Great. Thank Solomon. I\u2019ll first recap how we finished 2021 and then move to the 2022 outlook. This slide is just the annual financial comparison. I think Steve and Solomon covered the volume and revenue trends well. Just to note a couple of factors Steve highlighted on our Q4 performance. $173 million of Q4 revenues represents roughly 9.4% sequential growth over Q3 2021 and test process were almost 8% sequentially over Q3. This is despite the fact that Q3 was an unusually strong quarter, as Steve mentioned, for us with one-time benefits, both for volumes and revenues. So Progenity exited in the market in June. And on the revenue side, we had roughly $7 million of incremental reserve and prior period true-ups in Q3 versus Q4. 30:20 In Q4, we only had about $0.5 million in net true-up revenue benefits, which is a little unusual for us and that we generally had something like $1.5 million to $2 million this quarter, but that\u2019s part of the typical lumpiness that we've seen in the past. That lumpiness also creates some volatility in the quarterly gross margin, which is a little lower at 45.6% in the quarter. Another key driver of gross margins is paradoxically the success we are having with Signatera volumes. 30:49 The P&L for Signatera is really immature right now and I think is poised to improve as we get further into the launch. The patient's first Signatera test is expensive for COGS, since we run that upfront exome as an one-time event. We expect significant improvements in first-time point COGS in the next 18 months or so as we scale up. Subsequent volumes, of course, are much less expensive to run since we are just delivering the plasma test. So as the increasing percentage of our volumes come from repeat testing, the cost per test on average will drift downward. The same logic applies for ASPs. We benefit from ADLC pricing in recurrence monitoring and also we are implied to receive reimbursement on a broader range of tumor types, as Solomon described. 31:37 Given the strong organic adoption we have seen across tumor types, the relatively streamlined path to CMS reimbursement and the lung side we have provincial guideline inclusion in colorectal cancer, which would drive commercial coverage in CRC. We think the best strategy to take advantage of our lead with Signatera is to drive volume in multiple different cancers, even if this puts some modest pressure on gross margins in the immediate term. 32:04 In contrast, underlying ASPs for Panorama, Horizon, and Prospera were strong in the quarter. We made some meaningful sequential gains in the Panorama ASP over Q3 as one of the larger plan suspended their prior authorization requirements for average risk in IPP. I think we still have significant room to improve on Panorama ASPs given a large fraction of our NIPT volume is not yet reimbursed today. The OpEx lines represent the scale-ups of our commercial channels and transplant and especially Oncology as Steve and Solomon covered. 32:37 In R&D, we have a couple of large projects focused on the next version of each of our core products. We are very excited about those and we will be able to spend more time on these innovations on future calls. We also are developing products that can be used in conjunction with Signatera similar to the way that Altera is being used today. When thinking about R&D, it's worth a reminder that essentially all of our volume and revenue comes from products we have developed internally, whether it's the development of the new algorithm used in the SMART trial or inventing Signatera or launching innovations that dramatically reduce the cost of goods sold per unit, we've had a very high win rate with the investments we've made in our R&D efforts. We expect that productivity to continue, particularly as we focus more on the next version of already successful products and inherently take less technical risk as a result. 33:31 Another huge benefit from this internal development pipeline is that, we haven't needed to pay a premium to acquire other companies. So, we think this approach is also the most capital-efficient path for future growth. R&D in 2022, also incorporates a major step up in clinical trial investment for Prospera and Signatera. For reference, clinical trial spend was roughly $20 million in 2020 and we expect it to be roughly $80 million in 2022. A large chunk of that increase is coming from the large randomized controlled trials going on right now. Once completed, they won\u2019t have to be run again. 34:08 Given this increase, we've been selective with the trial that we sign, they must prove our clinical utility in a way that we think will drive broader adoption and/or change practice guidelines. I don't think clinical trial spend needs to increase meaningfully beyond our expected 2022 levels to achieve our goals in the indications Solomon presented. Beyond that, we would pursue larger trials on a case-by-case basis and only on the back of very strong performance. 34:37 The last major source of investment is capital expenditures require to scale the lab for all this new volume. For context, we had about $19 million in CapEx in 2020 and we expect about $60 million in 2022. We'll get into this in the guide, but CapEx is also not something that needs to remain elevated, but we expect to transition to maintenance levels in the future. Just a note on the balance sheet, we exited the year with about $915 million in cash and equivalents and we think this amount of capital will allow us to pursue all of the objectives we've outlined today. 35:11 Okay. So that is a good segue to the 2022 guide on the next page. Overall, we think this is a bullish guide that implies significant revenue and volume growth while holding gross margins and cash flow stable versus last year as we continue to make the investments we described today. We are guiding revenues of $770 million to $790 million, pro forma for the one-time [indiscernible] revenue recognition of $28.3 million in 2021, this represents 31% growth on top of a very successful year we just produced. 35:42 Steve mentioned, we took a note of caution with this guide, while case counts are thankfully down, we've built in some conservatism in the volume forecast to account for Omicron and future COVID-19 spikes. While we haven't seen anything that would significantly disrupt our business, we want to hear on the side of caution as each spike represents its own challenges. We do expect the new product volumes to continue to grow and that's based on the trends we've seen so far this year. 36:08 On ASPs, on balance we expect Signatera ASPs to improve this year driven by expanded reimbursement and higher mix of recurrence monitoring tests. This improvement is going to be held back a bit by the volume we are driving at tumor types that are not yet reimbursed, but we do expect net improvement in ASP this year. We've taken a cautious approach with the potential guideline inclusion and broader reimbursement in colorectal cancer. Solomon had that on his coverage roadmap and described it as a goal for 2022 and 2023, so we are keeping that potential benefit out of the financial guide for this year right now since we don't fully control the timing. 36:43 We expect stable ASPs in Prospera and Horizon, which is modestly more bullish than where we've been in the past. As a reminder, we normally bake-in some ASP erosion into these products, but the underlying trend was much stronger than they have in the past several years. On prenatal testing, we think the trends for Panorama was strong, as I mentioned and expect continued linear improvement and reimbursement. Steve mentioned the colorectal screening program, which is a bit of a wildcard since we haven't formally signed all the proceeds. The guide incorporates what we expect right now, which is that we offer a narrow test at a lower price build on a test specifically later. Practically speaking, the counter of this should be significant volume growth for any [indiscernible] volume and complementary products. In the guide, however, we've been very cautious with this part of the forecast as there are a lot of details that we worked out and we may not participate at all. 37:33 So, the contribution in the guide is an increase in volume from this narrower panel at a lower gross margin with room left for upside on the other women's health products. The gross margin guide also reflects the expectation that we drive a lot of first time Signatera patients as we talked about. Our gross margin in 2021 pro forma for the [indiscernible] was about 46.7%. So, this gross margin guide holds margin stable as we get through this launch phase with Signatera. 38:01 Steve touched on the path of 22q guidelines today and while we feel very good about that process, the guide does not incorporate any meaningful change to 22q reimbursement given that it's not fully in our control. The drivers for R&D and SG&A are consistent with the Q4 trends I described. We've built a strong commercial team that we think can now get significant operating leverage from this point coupled with a step up in clinical trial spend in 2022. So, the net of all that expanding revenues, improving ASPs, scaling operations is that we expect the 2022 cash burn to be roughly similar for last year. We think the commercial team build out is reflected in this guide and to remain relatively stable in future years, even as the volumes continue to grow in these large markets we're pursuing. 38:50 So, even as we continue to make investments in R&D and lab capacity, we expect cash burn to start to go down meaningfully in '23 and 2024 based on the markets and products we are pursuing today. It's worth remembering that we've gotten scale like this before. In 2019, we said the number one goal of the company was to get the women's health offerings to cash flow breakeven. We did that by driving growth through ever greater efficiency from our sales teams, delivering excellent data and securing broader reimbursement. 39:20 Transplant and oncology offer a few new advantages. Many of the markets are much larger, most patients receive repeat testing and we think the path to broad reimbursement is shorter, but fundamentally we are pursuing the same strategies that worked for us in the past. So it's an exciting time for Signatera and we are very pleased to have been able to serve these results with you. 39:40 Now, I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: 39:46 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nTejas Savant: 40:04 Hey guys, good evening, and thanks for the time here and congrats on a strong finish to the year and a healthy outlook. Maybe just to kick off on the guide, one for you, Mike. Can you share some color on what's included in terms of Signatera and Prospera contributions relative to reproductive health at least directionally? And on a related note, given how far ahead of at least all model you were in terms of both Signatera and Prospera volumes. Can you give us a sense of what fraction of that volume you're reimbursed on at the moment?\nMichael Brophy: 40:40 Yeah, Tejas. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so obviously as these businesses ramp, they're going to contribute an ever larger proportion of the volumes in the revenue as we go forward. I think that's the way that we've guided it. Having said that, I mean there is a lot of pretty exciting dynamics happening in the NICC space that may end up having women's health business grow quite rapidly, but we are obviously we've been more cautious with that type of guide. 41:11 So, directionally you seem to be an increasing portion of the other revenue for 2022 and I think that's implied by the ramp that you've seen here in 2021. The proportion of Signatera that's reimbursed today is a minority of the volume, just because of where we are on our reimbursement timeline. So, we've got volumes coming from multiple different cancer types, majority of which is colorectal cancer, but a significant minority is coming from other cancer types. They're are not yet reimbursed, although were implied on a number of additional reimbursement from [indiscernible] number of additional tumor types. 41:57 And then within colorectal cancer, of course, we're just reimbursed from Medicare and Steve and Solomon laid the pathway out where we think we can potentially broad that guideline inclusion. So, right now it\u2019s a minority that's getting reimburse and that's what's -- that's obviously reflected in the guide, although I think some commentary now presuming that we do make some progress in the \u2013 in terms of the overall Signatera ASP [indiscernible] .\nTejas Savant: 42:20 Got it. Super helpful. And one quick follow-up for Solomon here, if I can. Solomon on the MRD front, some of your peers here are starting to talk about more than 16 markers for their version of a tumor informed panels for MRD. I was just curious as to your latest thoughts on what do you think where diminishing returns to sensitivity begin to kick in in terms of the number of variants? And then on the screening side, any early color from the FDA in accepting your Aarhus cohort in lieu of a prospective trial for colorectal screening?\nSteve Chapman: 42:55 Yeah. This is Steve, I'll take that. And then Solomon you can jump in. So, first of all --\nSolomon Moshkevich: 43:01 Sure.\nSteve Chapman: 43:01 I think it's important to see on additional variance that were already running broad variant panels in the RUO lab and we have been for quite a while. So, if you remember with Panorama we multiplexed 13,000 probes in a single reaction. So for us to develop an assay with 100 variants or 200 variants, it's really easy to do. We do that all the time. I think we chose 16, because we thought that was the right optimization for performance and I think largely that's turned out to be true. 43:39 So obviously, we have the capabilities to run broader panels, but we're really pleased with the performance that we're seeing today. I mean, look at our volumes in MRD testing, we think we're now getting very, very close to being the market leader overall in the entire field of liquid biopsy, not just including MRD testing based on the test that we have on the market today. 44:02 So of course, we're always looking at opportunities to improve. There is multiple different things that we're doing right now. Investing in the future of Signatera, additional variants is something that we can do easily if we chose to launch that in the clear setting. 44:19 I think on early cancer detection, we're not giving any additional updates today. I think our plan is to generate some data and hopefully have that towards the end of 2022, early 2023 that we can share publicly. We do plan on meeting with the FDA to discuss the all health study. And as a reminder, the all health study is not just a biobank of randomly collected samples. I mean this was an IRB approved early cancer detection study, very similar to many of the other studies that are being run today where samples are collected and then they are banked and then they'll run at a singular time. So, these are all prospectively collected samples under an IRB for the purposes of validating early cancer detection. 45:08 The only difference is that, we've been swapped in as the biomarker of choice versus I think others were the biomarker was defined initially. So I think we're in good position, we're going to get some feedback. But you should plan on getting some data towards the end of the year or the beginning of next year.\nTejas Savant: 45:29 Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for the color guys.\nOperator: 45:33 Thank you. And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.\nPuneet Souda: 45:43 Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one is on NIPT and another one on Signatera. Maybe just for the California screening program, I mean, could you maybe size that opportunity for us and what's the timing of that? And could you elaborate, is that something exclusive to you or should we assume that you're going to maintain your sort of market share in that large opportunity?\nSteve Chapman: 46:13 Yes. So, as far as market share goes and things like that. I mean, we know that we've been selective. I believe there are other labs that are also being considered, although we don't know the exact details. It doesn't mean that we're definitively participating. But if we do, we think it's going to be a lower-priced assay where we will offer additional less content. We've applied for an individual PLA code there, we think we'll get to sell additional content alongside the program. So, I think we're in good position, but there's a lot of details that still need to be worked out there before we can really give a lot of the specifics. 46:59 Mike do you have any other comments there?\nMichael Brophy: 47:03 No, I think that covers it.\nPuneet Souda: 47:08 Okay. And then on the Signatera and Altera volumes. I appreciate you providing the details here, but it was clearly a significant pickup in the fourth quarter. And it's clear that you are emphasizing volume growth and indication expansion while ASP is expected to grow more longer-term. I think the biggest question here from investors is just sort of the growth rate that you're seeing here in Signatera and volume. Maybe just give us a sense of how should we imagine that for 2022 within the context of your guide? And given the fact that what Solomon said is, you're only 10% of your commercial footprint right now. So a number of factors are going into it. So anything you can provide in sort of the growth rates that we should be assuming for Signatera. I know it's still somewhat early days for the product, but that would be super helpful? 48:07 And then have a -- just a final quick one for Mike on gross margin. Just want to understand what's the longer-term gross margin objective, the gross margins are a bit softer versus our expectations for 2022? Thank you .\nSteve Chapman: 48:22 So, maybe I'll comment briefly on just kind of Signatera trajectory and then Mike, you can talk about how we incorporated that into the guide. So obviously we've given an annual volume here. But of course, this means on a sequential quarter-on-quarter basis things are accelerating. I mean we feel like at this point, we're doing exceptionally well from a volume standpoint, significantly better than any MRD company out there. I mean things are going really well. I mean we sort of know what other companies are reporting out publicly with regards to like their entire company's book of liquid biopsy volume. And as we said, we think we're very, very close to being the entire market leader for the entire book of liquid biopsy. So, things are on a good trajectory. 49:19 Mike, do you want to talk about the guide?\nMichael Brophy: 49:22 Yeah. So, I think Steve covered it in terms of the volume growth and the trajectory kind of similar to the answer to Tejas' question. I mean, we expect both of these products based on the trend that we've seen so far this year to continue to contribute and continue to grow. So there is an increasing percentage of the acquired volume gross percentage here. Part of the reason why we want to share the numbers -- the volumes is [indiscernible] gross margins. I mean because this is a relatively low gross margin test right now, but over time, clearly a high gross margin test. We feel like it's worthy to be driving this volume here despite the immediate term pressure on gross margins. 50:05 As we talked about it in the past, I mean nothing about the past year just waiting me from that concept [indiscernible] be a 70% plus gross margin business overall, over time. And I think we can -- we've shown a lot of ability to drive gross margin traction for those of us on the call who have been around for 4, 5 years and recall gross margins in the low '30s range and we've driven them to this level. 50:32 The gross margin guide implies basically a stable gross margin despite a new wave of Signatera test they're coming in ahead of reimbursement. So, what that implies is that the other products are really delivering a lot of gross margin leverage, so that's exactly what we're seeing in Prospera, Panorama, and Horizon for example. So, this is a dynamic situation, but I think on balance it's a bullish thing and we think it is the right thing to do to make the investment just given the demand that we're seeing and the traction that we have toward getting reimbursement for MOLDX and additional cancer types.\nPuneet Souda: 51:11 Got it. Okay, helpful guys. Thank you.\nOperator: 51:16 Thank you. And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nTycho Peterson: 51:24 Hey, good afternoon. On multi-cancer MRD you mentioned you've submitted some additional indications to MOLDX. Can you just clarify which those are? And I guess you're expecting 5 to be reimbursed next year, so have you submitted all five at this point? And then you also alluded to some adjacent products like Altera, can you maybe just clarify what you're talking about there and if that could come this year?\nSteve Chapman: 51:47 Yeah. So the guidelines basically state that you have to have published data before you can submit the tech assessment. And so, if you look at the areas where we published data, I think we now have 15 peer-reviewed papers in Signatera and we think this year we can publish an additional 20 or more papers that we have 100 different clinical trials that are ongoing right down in the field of Oncology. So I think it's really targeting in on where we published data, those would be the candidates for submitting to MOLDX. And we think this -- I think not only it's great because we get the performance of our product out there to talk to physicians, but we think we're leading the field and we have a significant margin on the number of studies and number of papers that are out there. 52:43 So, things like bladder for example, it is one of the areas where I think it would make sense for us to submit it so forth, you can go through the list if you go back to the slide of what's been published. Then as far as additional content goes, I mean one of the strategies that has worked really well for us in women's health that we talked about on this call is offering additional content and additional products at the same call point. And so in women's health, if we sell a Panorama tests we can also sell a Horizon carrier screening and we can also sell 22q screening. So we think long-term oncology will be the same way where there'll be a portfolio of products. So things like Altera, for example, therapy selection, something that we already have on the market today. I think liquid biopsy therapy selection, it's something that probably makes sense. 53:43 And so, as we talk about our R&D budget and the spending that we're doing there, a lot of that is going towards making sure that we have a rounded portfolio long term and that we continue to invest in a very significant way into enhancements to Signatera.\nTycho Peterson: 54:05 Okay, that's helpful. And then on Panorama, can you just update us on your latest thinking around microdeletions, could we get something this year?\nSteve Chapman: 54:15 Yeah. So, I think we're -- at this point we're sort of in a holding pattern. We're waiting for the guideline committee to meet and then we're going to see what the results are. I think it's definitely possible we can get something this year. I think the SMART -- the big news that's happened this year is that the SMART study was published in The Gray Journal and the results were excellent. So all the other earnings calls will be talking about this, we didn't have the results published. And so now I think we're at a point where the guideline committee could meet and they can assess whether they want to incorporate this into guidelines. 54:53 So, if you go back to prepared remark, we sort of kicked off all the different reasons why we think this might meet the criteria, but ultimately it's out of our hands, but it certainly meets the criteria and definitely without a doubt the publication that was -- the study that was done was very significant and the fact that is now published makes it eligible for coverage.\nTycho Peterson: 55:23 Great. And then just lastly, I know you don't want to talk about screening much at this point, but can you just clarify with the data set that you have, will you be doing other cancers in parallel with that dataset or should we just think about data later this year around colorectal?\nSteve Chapman: 55:35 Yeah, I think the initial readout is going to be colorectal, but I think longer term, it makes sense to have a multi-cancer offering. But the initial readout that we'll be doing and the initial, I think, launch will be in, in colorectal.\nTycho Peterson: 55:53 Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: 55:57 And thank you. And our next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Your line is now open.\nCatherine Schulte: 56:06 Hey guys, thanks for the questions. I guess first maybe on the ASP assumptions for NIPT in the guide. Can you just talk about where you are in terms of getting state Medicaid plans to cover average risk and what kind of progress do you expect on that front in 2022?\nSteve Chapman: 56:23 Yes. So, that's been an area of continued improvement. I think there is still some commercial plans that we're still working on. But there's a long tail of plans including State Medicaid plans that are still kind of in the process of putting coverage in place. And we think that has improved on an annual basis and is going to continue to improve in the future. So certainly, we're expecting some improvement there. 56:53 Mike, do you want to comment on kind of your thoughts on like NIPT ASP trajectory?\nMichael Brophy: 57:02 Yeah. I mean I think what we've -- what we've presumed in the margin and the guide and the model is just kind of modest and linear improvement in the NIPT ASP over the course of the year. And I think as we've talked about before, I think that's something that is poised to continue over a couple of years as we just win reimbursement coverage long tail. It's not just coverage decision it's, for example, getting prior authorization requirements removed, which helps us actually sequentially in the quarter on the NIPT ASP, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, so there is a laundry list of activities to pursue there. And on balance, things look quite positive for NIPT ASP trajectory.\nCatherine Schulte: 57:53 Okay, got it. And then you had a big step up in licensing and other revenue in the quarter, were there anyone timer's in near it? Was it really RUO Signatera driven?\nSteve Chapman: 58:05 Yeah. I think here is a mix. We have -- as we got to some milestones with our progress will Foundation Medicine that was a contribution, but then also, we have very strong continued progress with Signatera Pharma, I forgotten to mention in the prepared remarks.\nCatherine Schulte: 58:26 Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: 58:31 Thank you. And our next question comes from Max Masucci from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nMax Masucci: 58:41 Thanks for taking the questions. One on transplant. Just curious what portion of the transplant volumes are coming from your competitive wins versus greenfield or new adopters? And if the mix of volumes coming from competitive wins versus non-competitive has shifted at all over the last 12 months?\nSteve Chapman: 59:03 Yes. So, I think we're doing really well in transplant. As we've said for a long time, but now I\u2019m glad we finally are able to really share the volumes with you guys. And we did -- we're doing healthy, greater than 42,000 units last year, I think that's really exceptional. We see a mix there, there is some competitive wins and there are some greenfield wins. We're now like working with a very, very significant portion of the top transplant centers, we've outlined and sort of picked through that before, but if you go through the top 10 and you go through the top 50, I mean we're working in the premier centers. Many of the top centers. So, we're doing really well. 59:50 I do think our competitors in the space have done a good job growing their business and they've proven that there is a very significant growth trajectory here and a very significant business here. And so, I think we are on that same growth trajectory now and we're pleased with our performance and we're continuing to see momentum. I think one of the things that's going to accelerate our ability for competitive wins are these 3 major peer-reviewed papers that we expect to come out in 2022. That's the Trifecta study in kidney, that's the large multi-site study in hearts and that's the prospective -- the large prospective trial on lung that we described earlier in the presentation. So, I think we're in a good position, but things are \u2013 we have the potential to accelerate.\nMax Masucci: 60:50 Great. Maybe one for Solomon. I\u2019d be curious to hear about the work you're doing in multiple myeloma and any other blood-based cancers and just curious if you're using bone marrow or blood upfront to design the follow-up test for myeloma?\nSolomon Moshkevich: 61:09 Yeah. We're -- thank you for the question. We're very excited about solving a pretty big clinical unmet need in monitoring for patients with multiple myeloma. Today, those patients in order to get MRD testing done need to get serial bone marrow biopsies, which are painful and expensive, and really therefore underutilized. And so a lot of patients just aren't getting enough monitoring or as much as they want and as much as physicians think would be useful. We're able to do to run Signatera the same way we do in solid tumors, so running it off from a blood sample, getting cell-free DNA and analyzing the personalized assay there. We design that personalized signature from an analysis of several different specimen types that we've done in research. We presented data at a conference last year showing really strong performance that exceeded that what you'd get from flow cytometry using FFTE samples as input, followed by custom design of the assay and analysis in the plasma. So we think this could really improve care for thousands of patients and we're looking forward to talk more about that when it's ready for market.\nMax Masucci: 62:31 Great, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: 62:36 And thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Massaro from BTIG. Your line is now open.\nMark Massaro: 62:45 Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the disclosures on oncology and transplant. I guess on the oncology side, is it safe to say that the vast majority of the split between Signatera and Altera is on Signatera itself? And then secondly, I think in the past you've talked about Signatera all in ASPs at around $500 per time point, is that right? And then thirdly Altera, should we think of that is getting reimbursed similar to like a FoundationOne?\nSteve Chapman: 63:20 Yes, so let me make a couple of comments. And then maybe Mike, you can talk or Solomon about the ASPs a little bit. But yeah, the vast majority of volume here is Signatera. I mean, we launched that before Altera, but also it's a much, much bigger opportunity. And then we're only really promoting Altera in a targeted way as well. I mean, generally for patients that want to get IO monitoring that are getting Signatera set up, we'll then also add Altera because of the convenience factor. So yeah, vast, vast majority in Signatera, vast majority in colorectal although we are starting to see growth in IO monitoring and then as we said in the call, more of the pan-cancer volume coming in. 64:13 I think on the ASP side on Altera, I think there is FDA approved versions which get the premier ADLT pricing, and we don't expect to get that. But I think we'd be participating to get more general CMS rate. But, Mike, do you want to talk about ASPs in general for Signatera or Alterra?\nMichael Brophy: 64:38 Yes, so Mark that's not right in terms of the ASP range for Signatera and you can see that that's a far cry from the price we get when we actually get paid. So, we have the ASP rate at $4,500 and the adjuvant time point ASP is in the $2,000. So, what that means is just we're driving that volume that are not yet reimbursed for Medicare or their commercial lives. And those are volumes that we think we can get reimbursed in the relative near term. So, we're pretty excited about the ASP trajectory for Signatera given the reimbursement wins with [indiscernible] it does mean that at the moment ASPs are just quite mature. And as we've said in the prepared remarks, even net of volume growth in Signatera we think some of these factories will drive the ASP higher in the year and that includes the higher mix for current monitoring tests. And just a broader plan B to reimbursement indications for MolDX.\nMark Massaro: 65:48 Okay, great. And then, it certainly seems like there could be a step function increase in MRD testing as there -- now that Signatera IO is reimbursed. Is that fair \u2013 I means, the 76,000 was certainly very impressive for 2021, but it seems like you guys are just getting started, '22 in my opinion could be a step function increase. Would you agree with that? 66:11 And then second part, have you received pricing yet for Signatera IO?\nSteve Chapman: 66:18 Yes. So, I think we certainly are expecting growth, I mean the trajectory is excellent right now. And as we said it kind of accelerating throughout 2021. I think that the MRD testing opportunity versus the monitoring opportunity is still going to drive a lot of the growth. Although IO is a big opportunity and we're starting to see that accelerate. I think just when you just look at the number of patients available and I think where physicians are more comfortable now using the testing, it's in that that CRC MRD and recurrence monitoring setting. So, I would expect the vast majority will be there, but IO is certainly making a contribution and that contribution is growing. 67:10 Point me the second part of your question, I apologies?\nMark Massaro: 67:13 Yeah. Have you received a price for Signatera IO yet? And if so, what is that?\nSteve Chapman: 67:19Yes. So we're still in the final stages of that, it's just a standard individual discussion with the MolDX program. I think our expectation is that's going to be roughly similar to the adjuvant colorectal pricing where there is a bundled price for the initial testing that occurs. And so, we think it will be like roughly similar to what we saw in that adjuvant bundle.\nMark Massaro: 67:49 Got it, okay. If I can sneak one final one. It looks like, I believe you're getting paid something around $2,841 per test for Prospera kidney, are you getting paid on any commercial lives at this time? And then I imagine that the vast majority of that bucket was Prospera kidney as opposed to Renasight?\nSteve Chapman: 68:12 Yeah. So right now, there's really not any commercial coverage in place. I think that's an opportunity, but we're seeing -- we're seeing Medicare consistently reimbursed, but really nothing from the commercial plans. And I think that could change over time. I think that's an opportunity for upside, probably about half of the patients roughly are sort of in Medicare at this point. As we're getting volume for transplant centers and also from the committed nephrologist, there are a decent number of commercial lives there. The contribution from heart and lung is currently available on the market, we're actually seeing good utilization there, but we're very, very early stages. So those aren't really incorporated here in a meaningful way. And then Renasight is in here, it is a meaningful portion of this, but the vast majority is Prospera.\nMark Massaro: 69:11 Terrific. Thanks so much.\nOperator: 69:16 And thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDan Leonard: 69:26 Thanks for taking the question. Could you share your thinking on the topic of price sensitivity in NIPT? Does the California contract signaled more price sensitivity or is that an isolated incident?\nSteve Chapman: 69:41 Yes. So, I think the -- what we think is the situation in California, we're still working through the details. There is going to be a lower priced offering. There is going to have very limited content. And I think we've applied for a specific PLA code from the AMA, which will signify the priced specifically for that more limited content. So, I think California is unique, they've had a state program for probably, I don't know, 20 plus years. And I think it's not something that really been deployed broadly across the United States. I think we're considering whether we participate or not at this point. If we do participate, we think there is definitely volume upside as we access additional offices that we're not currently in. So it's something we have to assess and take it from there as details emerge and as thing crystallize.\nDan Leonard: 70:47 And Steve, what is narrower content mean? Is this just trisomy 21 or does it include 18 and 13, just what a narrower panel look like?\nSteve Chapman: 70:57 Yeah. I think -- I think the details need to be fully flushed out, but from what we understand, it would be probably 21, 13 and 18 for example only.\nDan Leonard: 71:14 Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: 71:15 Sure.\nOperator: 71:19 And thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Nowak from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is now open.\nAlex Nowak: 71:31 Hey, great. Good afternoon, everyone. It looks like the FDA is looking to use near ties investigation in the prenatal test here. Is there some fuel for a broader push to regulate lab to test again. Can you just comment your thoughts there. What FDA's oversight might mean for the business?\nSteve Chapman: 71:47 Yes. So, we actually really support any additional regulatory oversight. I mean, we're already very heavily regulated today, but we've looked at this kind of valid act that's out there. We strongly support that. I think the good news is that, we are by far without a doubt the most thoroughly validated NIPT products on the market today. We have significantly more patients that have been studied in clinical trials and the largest multi-site prospective real world studies that have ever been done in this space. So, if there is regulation which we completely welcome, we're in an excellent position and we're in a probably the strongest position out of anybody.\nAlex Nowak: 72:40 Okay, got it. And then we've been hearing that the MolDX tech assessment process is actually been taking a little bit longer than what somewhere initially expected, and there is couple of examples out there in the markets. So, I think some of that could be COVID backlogs, but just what are you hearing and then specifically seeing with regards to your own tech assessment process for new Signatera indications?\nSteve Chapman: 73:00 That's [indiscernible] forward. But let me -- maybe I'll make some comments and then you can go ahead. Our experience so far hasn't been in that way, but that doesn't mean that there's no delays. I think so far we've after getting the initial colorectal coverage we then additionally submitted a tech assessment for stage IV CRC oligometastatic and we got that I think last fall. So that was a follow-on under the tech assessment process after the peer-reviewed paper came out last spring. And then obviously we got the IO coverage, which was part of the pan-cancer LCD that came out. And we submitted multiple different tech assessments at this point and we're in active discussions. 73:55 Solomon, do you want to comment further?\nSolomon Moshkevich: 73:58 Sure. Yeah, I think certainly a year, year and a half ago we were seeing Medicare backed up, they were reviewing so many submissions for new COVID tests coming to market, but that --they're not really seeing that from what we've heard so much in the last few months and what exactly what Steve said, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary right now.\nAlex Nowak: 74:27 That's great to hear. I appreciate the update. Thanks.\nOperator: 74:32 And thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Mikson from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nKyle Mikson: 74:41 Great. Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. So you've mentioned Signatera volume is shifting in favor of the current monitoring settings as an ASP tailwind. I guess just quickly, is there repeat test that you're expecting for 2022 and 2023? Is that mostly CRC or is it other tumor types? And just -- obviously there is implications on reimbursement ASP, unlike a cancer type or cancer type basis. So I'm just curious what you're thinking there for like next year and going forward?\nSteve Chapman: 75:07 Yes. So the vast majority of orders that we see where the doctors requesting a protocol or in the field of CRC, but we are starting to see in the additional tumor types as doctors become comfortable they start to move to a repeat order model. So we think over time it's going to be both, but the vast majority of the volume and the repeat orders is in CRC.\nKyle Mikson: 75:41 Okay. And then just a quick one for Mike. I think you were talking about this in your prepared remarks, but COGS per test, does that increased or stayed flat in 2021? Could you just confirm if that's true? And then how COGS per test could evolve going forward and why that would decrease as the new products receive reimbursement?\nMichael Brophy: 75:59 Yeah. The reason why the COGS per test are going to go down is because we're just really immature in particular on the Signatera COGS. So we touched on the prepared remarks one of the big projects in the R&D lab is to get more efficient on that first time point [XM] (ph), which we think we can do. It\u2019s surely more a matter of scaling up more than anything else. The COGS before the other for the risk monitoring test for Signatera and for NIPT and Prospera really all leverage and a lot of the core technology that we've developed here over time. 76:39 And for example on NIPT, we've got a -- we think a clear pathway from the 160 range to 125 range or so over time and potentially lower. So it\u2019s this similar trajectory across the other products. So that's the path to reducing cost of goods sold per test and we've got a long track record doing that going back 7 years plus.\nKyle Mikson: 77:09 Okay. It makes sense. Thanks guys.\nOperator: 77:17 And thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "20:39 Thanks, Steve. We're now working across all 3 of these areas on the slide here, for an estimated total addressable market North of $50 billion. Given we just provided an update on the early cancer detection program earlier this year, the key focus of this business update will be on the MRD space and the Signatera opportunity. As many of you know, we've had several major wins recently, so I'm excited to elaborate. 21:06 Let's start with the commercial and operational teams that we have built over the last 18 months or so. Steve touched on the competitive advantage, we think this team is already delivering. And I think the Signatera volumes in 2021 prove that out. The commercial team is now similarly-sized as the big teams from other liquid biopsy players. They've been in place with consistent sales territories for only a couple of quarters. So, we think there is ample room for our team to get more efficient with initiating new clinics and supporting growth within existing accounts. We estimate the commercial team is only at roughly 10% capacity in terms of the number of ordering patients and accounts that they can manage. 21:45 Over the same time, we've also dramatically scaled our operations and launched flexible and intuitive user experience tools for seamless ordering of the test. No other company in this space has ever reached this level of scale with a personalized serial monitoring test. So we've solved a lot of new challenges to get to this point. On lab operations in Q4, we saw a median turnaround time of 19 days for a patient's initial test results, and less than a week for subsequent tests. This means we're delivering test results within a clinically meaningful timeframe to inform adjuvant treatment decisions. Especially since Signatera can be initiated at any time pre or post-surgery, unlike other assays that are indicated only starting at 30 days post-surgery. 22:32 Other laboratories that have ambitions to launch a tumor-informed MRD test will have to solve many of these same operational challenges, but with the added pressure of Signatera already being commercially available. Our suite of user experience tools are also making an impact, which, of course, levers everything we've learned from operating in competitive environment for the last 10 years. The core of this offering are the online portals, EMR integrations, and a customer support infrastructure that is designed to facilitate serial monitoring and can be adjusted to fit the unique evolving needs of every patient. 23:07 As Steve mentioned, we think the strongest components of our offering are the clinical performance of the test itself and the extensive validation data we've already produced and continue to produce across a broad range of cancer types. We expect our lead in data generation to only increase this year. We've now got more than 100 clinical studies on our pipeline, including projects with pharma partners and academic partners that we expect a strong year of peer-reviewed publications as Steve described. 23:35 On the subject of clinical data, we were glad to host many of you for a special call about the data that was presented in January at ASCO GI. The interim readout from CIRCULATE Japan included analysis from over 1,000 patients with 12 months of follow up stratified by MRD status and for the first time also stratified by treatment status, which enabled the predictive claims that we can now make about Signatera in colorectal cancer. I want to just briefly review our results there, and the next steps. 24:05 So the central question for us in CRC has always been, will MRD positive patients benefit from adjuvant treatment? Or are they just destined to recur regardless of treatment? This data clearly shows that Signatera positive patients do benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The green lines in these charts represent Signatera MRD positive patients that received chemotherapy and the blue lines are the MRD positive patients that did not receive chemotherapy. You can see a clear separation of the lines, and the p-values were significant in all stages of disease, even when adjusting for other confounding factors, such as age and lymph node status. 24:45 The hazard ratios here are striking, for example, in the middle chart we see Stage III Signatera positive patients are over 8 times more likely to recur if they are observed instead of getting treated with adjuvant therapy. We know that a significant group of patients that are indicative for chemotherapy today do not actually get treated for a variety of reasons. Now with the support of this interim data, we think it's going to be much more likely that MRD-positive patients choose to pursue chemotherapy. 25:18 Now on the next slide, we address the other side of the coin, with Signatera MRD negative patients benefit from chemotherapy or can they safely avoid chemo, while being serially monitored. You can see from the chart that there is no separation between the lines, which means that Signatera MRD negative patients received no significant treatment benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in this study. Among patients who tested MRD negative at four weeks post-surgery the 12 months survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not statistically significant and it would not be worth for toxicity of chemotherapy. We believe this data could have an immediate impact for thousands of CRC patients, who are already on the borderline about chemotherapy and we look forward to confirming these results in future readouts from the trial. 26:06 In addition to the predictive findings that I just covered, the prognostic data on the assay was also very strong, as we've shown before. Based on the single time point post-surgery disease-free survival at 12 months was 95% for the Signatera negative patients and 55% for the Signatera positive patients, yielding a hazard ratio higher than 13. Signatera sensitivity was 67% at the single time point, which is stronger than what was previously reported in our 2019 paper in JAMA Oncology. Overall, we think this test performance is really exceptional. 26:44 The next slide is an updated snapshot of the addressable patient population in MRD that is built up from estimated tests per year. The short-term eligible population represents indications where we have already generated initial data and have line of sight to gaining Medicare reimbursement over the next 2 years, which we think together can support up to 4 million Signatera tests per year in those indications. This now includes several GI indications outside of colorectal, including pancreatic, gastroesophageal, and anal cancers, where we've recently presented clinical data. 27:18 Looking further out, we think prospective randomized trials may be required to unlock additional indications that, if successful, we believe could support Signatera volumes of up to 13 million test per year. We are already working on generating that data and we expect the first large prospective readouts over the next 3 to 5 years. Because Signatera is personalized and agnostic to tumor type, we have a great opportunity here to leverage the same product in the same commercial channel to drive adoption across all of these indications as it gives significant leverage on our investment. 27:52 Now, let's take a look at the coverage roadmap for the next few years. After receiving the initial MolDX coverage decision in Stage II and III CRC and the subsequent umbrella policy was released, we have been able to rapidly follow up and win coverage in pan-cancer immunotherapy response monitoring and stage IV CRC. We've now submitted additional indications to the MolDx program and we expect additional coverage decisions to come in in 2022 and 2023. Key goal we have over that timeframe is to get into NCCN guidelines. We think the CRC data we presented from CIRCULATE Japan, once it's peer-reviewed and published merits consideration for guideline inclusion. 28:34 The ASCO guideline update last December specifically referenced ctDNA as an emerging potential predictive factor and it anticipated that forthcoming prospective data could merit inclusion in an upcoming future guideline. We have now generated that predictive data and will further support that effort with additional readouts from CIRCULATE as well as data coming soon from BESPOKE, our prospective registry trial in CRC. 29:01 We will take a similar approach with the other cancer types as well, generating additional evidence to support clinical utility across each of them. Although, we feel good about our chances for NCCN guideline inclusion, it is ultimately outside of our control. So, we do remain cautious in terms of the potential impact in our guide for this year. 29:21 Now, let me hand over the call to Mike to discuss the financials. Mike? 43:01 Sure. 61:09 Yeah. We're -- thank you for the question. We're very excited about solving a pretty big clinical unmet need in monitoring for patients with multiple myeloma. Today, those patients in order to get MRD testing done need to get serial bone marrow biopsies, which are painful and expensive, and really therefore underutilized. And so a lot of patients just aren't getting enough monitoring or as much as they want and as much as physicians think would be useful. We're able to do to run Signatera the same way we do in solid tumors, so running it off from a blood sample, getting cell-free DNA and analyzing the personalized assay there. We design that personalized signature from an analysis of several different specimen types that we've done in research. We presented data at a conference last year showing really strong performance that exceeded that what you'd get from flow cytometry using FFTE samples as input, followed by custom design of the assay and analysis in the plasma. So we think this could really improve care for thousands of patients and we're looking forward to talk more about that when it's ready for market. 73:58 Sure. Yeah, I think certainly a year, year and a half ago we were seeing Medicare backed up, they were reviewing so many submissions for new COVID tests coming to market, but that --they're not really seeing that from what we've heard so much in the last few months and what exactly what Steve said, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary right now."

            "content": "02:42 Great. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We've got a packed session full of announcements, so let's get into the recent highlights. 2021 was a breakout year for Natera, volumes were up 53% year-on-year, which is higher than we pre-announced in January by more than 5,000 units. Despite all the disruption in the world from the Omicron variant, volumes were still very strong. We posted another record with 439,000 test process. In addition, this was also one of the largest sequential growth quarters we've ever seen on a net unit basis. 03:21 Revenues were $625.5 million for the full year, above the top end of our November guidance, and more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our regional revenue guide given in February of 2021. Looking at the quarter, once again, Q4 was a very strong revenue quarter as we came in at roughly $173 million. Mike and I will spend more time on the drivers behind these numbers and the remaining financial results shortly. 03:51 In addition to the excellent volume and revenue performance we recently set a new standard for clinical data in the field of cell-free DNA with presentations and publications that can have a very meaningful impact on patient care. First is the recent presentation at the ASCO GI conference from the prospective multisite CIRCULATE trial, which showed that Signatera is predictive of treatment benefit in colorectal cancer. We also showed that Signatera has exceptional sensitivity at the post-surgical time point. This was the largest prospective dataset ever presented using MRD testing in CRC and the first to show MRD testing is predictive of treatment benefit in CRC. 04:36 Second is the publication of the prospective multisite SMART trial in The Gray Journal, which is a leading Journal in Obstetrics and Gynecology. With the SMART trial getting into publication in a top journal, and with over 18,000 patients in the study, this now allows 22q screening to be formally considered for ACOG guidelines inclusion. There is a generally accepted set of criteria required for a disorder to be included in the prenatal testing guidelines and we believe the study results achieved all of the performance metrics required to meet this objective. 05:10 Finally, in Oregon Health, we were able to release very strong large scale prospective data in each heart, lung and kidney transplantation that we think can have a very positive impact when published, for example in kidney, the Trifecta study represents the largest prospective fully biopsy match study conducted to date, with nearly 3 times the number of biopsy match rejections as in DART study, which is one of the larger historical data sets in the space. We are very pleased that Prospera's performance in the study was exceptional, and we'll spend more time in all of these results later in the call. 05:46 Finally, we are pleased to be guiding full-year 2022 total revenues at $770 million to $790 million, which implies roughly 31% proforma revenue growth over 2021 at the midpoint. The guide reflects our usual cautious approach, but there is upside opportunity as we see ourselves entering 2022 strongly positioned for continued growth across our portfolio. 06:13 Okay, let's get into some of the business trends. The next slide is just an annual view of our volume growth over time. We have a long track record of execution which you can see that something different happened in 2021 where we are benefiting from 2 fundamental trends in health care. First, the use of cell-free DNA in Oregon Health and Oncology just getting started and we are a leader in both fields. The volume from cancer products and Oregon Health products are starting to make a significant impact on our growth. 06:41 Second is the increased pace of NIPT adoption in the US, post ACOG guidelines, which drives not only NIPT volumes, but also allows us to offer physicians other tests like carrier screening and 22q. I think our 2021 performance shows we are well-positioned to leverage these trends and we think these are multi-year drivers that we can continue to benefit from in the future. 07:03 Diving into a quarterly view on the next slide shows that the business trends remained very strong in Q4 with total revenue growth outpacing volume growth. In addition, quarterly sequential volume growth was strong at roughly 8%. This was one of the best sequential growth quarters we've ever had in spite of the fact that third quarter in 2021 was unusually strong for us because a large NIPT player exited the space in June and Q4 has fewer [seasoning] (ph) days due to the holidays. 07:35 The underlying ASP performance was strong, although we also had roughly $7 million in cash receipts from prior period true-ups and reserve benefits in Q3, which mutes the reported sequential pricing trends in Q4. $173 million in revenue was also well above expectations and all the growth trends continue to look quite strong so far in Q1. 08:00 On the next slide I'm excited to share a new snapshot of the volume trajectory in our newer products, which as you can see, have been growing rapidly. This is what I mean when I say cell-free DNA is just getting started in oncology transplantation. The left chart is our volume progression in Signatera and Altera in Oncology and the right chart is Prospera and Renasight in Oregon Health. 08:23 In Oncology, the vast majority of these volumes are Signatera units ordered by physicians for clinical use, but this also includes very strong pharma performance. Based on our current run rate and publicly available data, we believe that we're very close to being the overall market leader by volume in the field of liquid biopsy even when including both therapy selection and MRD testing categories. We think this performance is superior to any other MRD test on the market today. In addition, this rapid growth shows how big the MRD opportunity can be. 08:57 We've been able to drive this level of early adoption focusing primarily on colorectal cancer, which we think is still an under-penetrated market. Despite our historical focus on CRC, which represents less than 10% of the overall MRD opportunity, we are starting to see more volume come in from immunotherapy response monitoring in addition to MRD testing in other solid tumors beyond CRC. Some doctors start using Signatera in colorectal cancer and then expand to use it as a multi-cancer tool. This is an advantage of our patient-specific tumor informed assay. The same product can be applied to a broad range of cancer types without designing a new fixed panel for each tumor type. This growth is also impressive, because 2021 was a building year for us with regards to our commercial and operational teams. We've now built a full commercial team that still has a lot of leverage left for growth. 09:51 Paired with that our robust live operations now allow us to scale, as we built out the infrastructure to optimize turnaround times and manage recurrent orders, both of which take time to master. We're in a great position to grow the market, but I think what's most impressive is our data leadership. We've got paradigm-shifting predictive data now in both colorectal and bladder cancers. We have over 100 additional studies underway and it's possible we can publish more than 20 peer-reviewed papers in 2022 alone. In addition, in 2022 we will be receiving repeat testing volume from patients that started on Signatera in 2021, which is when the vast majority of our current patients initiated testing, driving continued growth for us. Overall, we believe we're in a very strong position to expand our leadership here and in the liquid biopsy field. 10:45 In Oregon Health, the majority of our volume in the slide is coming from Prospera orders, but it does also include a meaningful contribution from Renasight. In 2022, we expect added momentum from the publication of the Trifecta study in kidney and we expect meaningful volumes from the contribution of our recent launches in heart and lung resulting from the publication of leading studies in those organs. 11:10 It's worth noting that the commercial and operational infrastructure needed to support years of growth is largely built now, so we have an opportunity to get significant leverage out of our current team as centers adopt donor-derived cell-free DNA testing. You can see from this volume trajectory why we think we are positioned to be a top player in this space for years to come. For now, we will plan on providing the snapshot once annually on the Q4 call in order to preserve competitive positioning. But, I think the 2021 volume show that these are not going to be niche products and we are on the path to achieving scale in these new areas. 11:47 Now, let's move to the second major trend on the next slide. After gaining a full ACOG endorsement in 2020 for NIPT, adoption grew significantly in 2021, even as the overall market for NIPT grew based on our estimates, Panorama actually increased market share. As you can see on the right side of the chart, there is still a long way to go to get anywhere near full adoption. We've estimated that the NIPT market can reach 80% to 90% adoption in the coming years. In addition to growing adoption in the community setting we are seeing growth from large group practices and health systems. For example, we recently just closed a system of over 10 hospitals that's now rolling out NIPT to its patients for the first time. We think that our competitive edge in winning these deals is our significant body of peer-reviewed clinical evidence, our highly differentiated product and our strong suite of user experience tools. For example, we are now fully integrated into leading EMR systems, making it easier for systems to adopt Panorama broadly. 12:53 Additionally, although it's the only state-sponsored prenatal screening program we are aware of in the United States, we think the State of California is likely to expand their existing prenatal screening program from high-risk only in which Natera is already actively participating to now include average risk NIPT. We've been selected to participate in this program, and are currently in discussions with the State. If we do choose to move forward, we'd likely offer a lower-priced offering that screen for a narrower set of conditions, but we think that volume would increase as access is opened up by this program. We've already submitted for a unique PLA code for the more limited offering. In addition, we expect to offer other test in our portfolio like curious screening alongside the program as we enter new OB-GYN offices. 13:45 There are also a lot of key points in the program that are still under discussion, but, we've gone ahead and built this into our forecast, taken a conservative approach to the impact of the change. Across all channels OB-GYN, MSM, Hospital Systems, et cetera, we think Natera remains very well-positioned to extend its leadership position. The other opportunity that we see potentially compounding the value of increasing NIPT adoption is our ability to service the physician for additional tests that are routinely offered early in pregnancy. We think there are substantial growth opportunities here, as our commercial team meets with more and more physicians to also expand our client base for other tests, like genetic carrier screening that ACOG recommends to be offered to all pregnant women regardless of ethnicity or age. Historically, Natera's Carrier screening orders has scaled up together with our NIPT volume and we think that trend will continue. 14:38 Furthermore, we believe screening for the 22q may soon be recommended as part of routine practice, which may further expand the value we can offer to our patients and ordering physicians. More on that topic on the next slide. 14:52 As many of you saw in our press release, the Landmark SMART 22q microdeletions study was recently published in The Gray Journal, which is a premier journal among OB-GYNs in the United States. SMART is by far the largest prospective study to confirm genetic outcomes on all pregnancies in the study. The results were excellent. The incidence of 22q in the study was 1 in 1,524, which confirms 22q is one of the most common prenatal genetic disorders in the general population and unlike trisomy 21 the incidents of the disorder is not impacted by maternal age. 15:30 By comparison, cystic fibrosis, which is screened routinely has an incidence of approximately 1 in 3,500 in the general population, and trisomy's 18 and 13 have an incidence of 1 in 3,000 and 1 in 5,000, respectively. Panorama test results were accurate, greater than 99.9% of the time, meaning that 99.9% of the time the Panorama result, whether high risk or low risk was confirmed to be correct. For high-risk results only, we had a positive predictive value or PPV of 53%, meaning that more than 1 in 2 pregnancies screening high risk with Panorama were confirmed to be effective using a confirmatory diagnostic test. This is really strong, especially compared to traditional prenatal test like the Quad screen offered routinely to all pregnant women in United States for the past 40 years that have a PPV of only 3.5% or 1 in 29. 16:31 So, the question remaining is, will this be recommended by ACOG for routine screening? Well, we don't control the outcome, but screen tests that offer the most clinical utility need a few criteria. They screen for a serious disorder with high accuracy and high PVV, they catch many cases that are not otherwise captured by the existing standard of care, and early detection provides an opportunity to intervene and improve outcomes. In the case of 22q that means treatment with calcium at birth in order to mitigate potential seizures that can result in cognitive impairment. We think our 22q microdeletions screen, clearly meets all of these criteria. It's common, it's severe, it can be screened for with high accuracy and there is an appropriate intervention. This sets up very nicely for a guideline change, but we will have to see where things end up. 17:21 Okay. Now, let's spend a bit more time on the Organ Health opportunity. You saw the excellent traction we've been getting in Prospera on the earlier slide, and we see a lot of room for future growth. When we presented this slide in 2020, we estimated fewer than 5% of transplant recipients were getting cell-free DNA testing. While that is clearly grown we think this chart shows Prospera can fill a significant unmet need in the coming years. And what we believe is yet another large market opportunity. 17:51 One driver we think can help increase adoption of cell-free DNA in this area is additional large prospective clinical trials that that confirm the excellent performance of Prospera. While we're pleased with the data we generated thus far we know that publishing big prospective trials can really move the needle. Although our volume has been growing nicely, this is probably the biggest objection we faced in the field. So, just as we did in Oncology and Women's Health we've been investing heavily in data generation. Finally, after a ton of work by our team and our outside collaborators, in 2022 we expect a wave of prospective, strong and meaningful data across kidney, heart and lung transplantation and we think this can make a significant impact for us. 18:33 So, first a minute on the Trifecta study in kidney transplantation. This study was led by Dr. Phil Halloran, who is one of the premier researchers in the field. Trifecta had more than 3 times the number of biopsy match rejections than the DART study. Trifecta also enrolled patients from more than 20 US and international sites. You can see that Prospera results from the initial readout were exceptional. The results were so strong that we believe it could eliminate the need for multi-modality testing to rescue test performance. 19:05 Multi-modality testing using RNA and cell-free DNA is very expensive. We think it could cost roughly $6,000 per blood draw compared to Prospera, which is less than half of that price. So we look forward to publishing the Trifecta study this spring and we think it will be a really significant step forward for Prospera adoption. 19:26 We also have 2 studies soon to be published in each of heart and lung transplantation. First-in-one, we were pleased last fall to pre-release data from the largest prospective lung donor-derived cell-free DNA trial to date using our commercially available assay. The data was very strong and accepted for an oral presentation at ISHLT. We look forward to the publication of this paper in the near term. 19:51 Finally in heart, we previously announced the readout of our multi-site study that includes a prospective and retrospective arm. We showed an excellent overall AUC of 0.84 with greater than 250 prospective samples included in the study and greater than 100 retrospective samples for total of greater than 350 overall. In fact the AUC in the prospective arm were slightly higher than retrospective arm. Again, this performance is very strong, it could eliminate the need to perform expensive multimodality test that in the context of heart transplantation require cumbersome specimen processing, for example, spinning down the sample and shipping it on dry ice. 20:33 Okay. Now, let me hand the call over to Solomon to provide an update on oncology. Solomon? 42:55 Yeah. This is Steve, I'll take that. And then Solomon you can jump in. So, first of all -- 43:01 I think it's important to see on additional variance that were already running broad variant panels in the RUO lab and we have been for quite a while. So, if you remember with Panorama we multiplexed 13,000 probes in a single reaction. So for us to develop an assay with 100 variants or 200 variants, it's really easy to do. We do that all the time. I think we chose 16, because we thought that was the right optimization for performance and I think largely that's turned out to be true. 43:39 So obviously, we have the capabilities to run broader panels, but we're really pleased with the performance that we're seeing today. I mean, look at our volumes in MRD testing, we think we're now getting very, very close to being the market leader overall in the entire field of liquid biopsy, not just including MRD testing based on the test that we have on the market today. 44:02 So of course, we're always looking at opportunities to improve. There is multiple different things that we're doing right now. Investing in the future of Signatera, additional variants is something that we can do easily if we chose to launch that in the clear setting. 44:19 I think on early cancer detection, we're not giving any additional updates today. I think our plan is to generate some data and hopefully have that towards the end of 2022, early 2023 that we can share publicly. We do plan on meeting with the FDA to discuss the all health study. And as a reminder, the all health study is not just a biobank of randomly collected samples. I mean this was an IRB approved early cancer detection study, very similar to many of the other studies that are being run today where samples are collected and then they are banked and then they'll run at a singular time. So, these are all prospectively collected samples under an IRB for the purposes of validating early cancer detection. 45:08 The only difference is that, we've been swapped in as the biomarker of choice versus I think others were the biomarker was defined initially. So I think we're in good position, we're going to get some feedback. But you should plan on getting some data towards the end of the year or the beginning of next year. 46:13 Yes. So, as far as market share goes and things like that. I mean, we know that we've been selective. I believe there are other labs that are also being considered, although we don't know the exact details. It doesn't mean that we're definitively participating. But if we do, we think it's going to be a lower-priced assay where we will offer additional less content. We've applied for an individual PLA code there, we think we'll get to sell additional content alongside the program. So, I think we're in good position, but there's a lot of details that still need to be worked out there before we can really give a lot of the specifics. 46:59 Mike do you have any other comments there? 48:22 So, maybe I'll comment briefly on just kind of Signatera trajectory and then Mike, you can talk about how we incorporated that into the guide. So obviously we've given an annual volume here. But of course, this means on a sequential quarter-on-quarter basis things are accelerating. I mean we feel like at this point, we're doing exceptionally well from a volume standpoint, significantly better than any MRD company out there. I mean things are going really well. I mean we sort of know what other companies are reporting out publicly with regards to like their entire company's book of liquid biopsy volume. And as we said, we think we're very, very close to being the entire market leader for the entire book of liquid biopsy. So, things are on a good trajectory. 49:19 Mike, do you want to talk about the guide? 51:47 Yeah. So the guidelines basically state that you have to have published data before you can submit the tech assessment. And so, if you look at the areas where we published data, I think we now have 15 peer-reviewed papers in Signatera and we think this year we can publish an additional 20 or more papers that we have 100 different clinical trials that are ongoing right down in the field of Oncology. So I think it's really targeting in on where we published data, those would be the candidates for submitting to MOLDX. And we think this -- I think not only it's great because we get the performance of our product out there to talk to physicians, but we think we're leading the field and we have a significant margin on the number of studies and number of papers that are out there. 52:43 So, things like bladder for example, it is one of the areas where I think it would make sense for us to submit it so forth, you can go through the list if you go back to the slide of what's been published. Then as far as additional content goes, I mean one of the strategies that has worked really well for us in women's health that we talked about on this call is offering additional content and additional products at the same call point. And so in women's health, if we sell a Panorama tests we can also sell a Horizon carrier screening and we can also sell 22q screening. So we think long-term oncology will be the same way where there'll be a portfolio of products. So things like Altera, for example, therapy selection, something that we already have on the market today. I think liquid biopsy therapy selection, it's something that probably makes sense. 53:43 And so, as we talk about our R&D budget and the spending that we're doing there, a lot of that is going towards making sure that we have a rounded portfolio long term and that we continue to invest in a very significant way into enhancements to Signatera. 54:15 Yeah. So, I think we're -- at this point we're sort of in a holding pattern. We're waiting for the guideline committee to meet and then we're going to see what the results are. I think it's definitely possible we can get something this year. I think the SMART -- the big news that's happened this year is that the SMART study was published in The Gray Journal and the results were excellent. So all the other earnings calls will be talking about this, we didn't have the results published. And so now I think we're at a point where the guideline committee could meet and they can assess whether they want to incorporate this into guidelines. 54:53 So, if you go back to prepared remark, we sort of kicked off all the different reasons why we think this might meet the criteria, but ultimately it's out of our hands, but it certainly meets the criteria and definitely without a doubt the publication that was -- the study that was done was very significant and the fact that is now published makes it eligible for coverage. 55:35 Yeah, I think the initial readout is going to be colorectal, but I think longer term, it makes sense to have a multi-cancer offering. But the initial readout that we'll be doing and the initial, I think, launch will be in, in colorectal. 56:23 Yes. So, that's been an area of continued improvement. I think there is still some commercial plans that we're still working on. But there's a long tail of plans including State Medicaid plans that are still kind of in the process of putting coverage in place. And we think that has improved on an annual basis and is going to continue to improve in the future. So certainly, we're expecting some improvement there. 56:53 Mike, do you want to comment on kind of your thoughts on like NIPT ASP trajectory? 58:05 Yeah. I think here is a mix. We have -- as we got to some milestones with our progress will Foundation Medicine that was a contribution, but then also, we have very strong continued progress with Signatera Pharma, I forgotten to mention in the prepared remarks. 59:03 Yes. So, I think we're doing really well in transplant. As we've said for a long time, but now I'm glad we finally are able to really share the volumes with you guys. And we did -- we're doing healthy, greater than 42,000 units last year, I think that's really exceptional. We see a mix there, there is some competitive wins and there are some greenfield wins. We're now like working with a very, very significant portion of the top transplant centers, we've outlined and sort of picked through that before, but if you go through the top 10 and you go through the top 50, I mean we're working in the premier centers. Many of the top centers. So, we're doing really well. 59:50 I do think our competitors in the space have done a good job growing their business and they've proven that there is a very significant growth trajectory here and a very significant business here. And so, I think we are on that same growth trajectory now and we're pleased with our performance and we're continuing to see momentum. I think one of the things that's going to accelerate our ability for competitive wins are these 3 major peer-reviewed papers that we expect to come out in 2022. That's the Trifecta study in kidney, that's the large multi-site study in hearts and that's the prospective -- the large prospective trial on lung that we described earlier in the presentation. So, I think we're in a good position, but things are \u2013 we have the potential to accelerate. 63:20 Yes, so let me make a couple of comments. And then maybe Mike, you can talk or Solomon about the ASPs a little bit. But yeah, the vast majority of volume here is Signatera. I mean, we launched that before Altera, but also it's a much, much bigger opportunity. And then we're only really promoting Altera in a targeted way as well. I mean, generally for patients that want to get IO monitoring that are getting Signatera set up, we'll then also add Altera because of the convenience factor. So yeah, vast, vast majority in Signatera, vast majority in colorectal although we are starting to see growth in IO monitoring and then as we said in the call, more of the pan-cancer volume coming in. 64:13 I think on the ASP side on Altera, I think there is FDA approved versions which get the premier ADLT pricing, and we don't expect to get that. But I think we'd be participating to get more general CMS rate. But, Mike, do you want to talk about ASPs in general for Signatera or Alterra? 66:18 Yes. So, I think we certainly are expecting growth, I mean the trajectory is excellent right now. And as we said it kind of accelerating throughout 2021. I think that the MRD testing opportunity versus the monitoring opportunity is still going to drive a lot of the growth. Although IO is a big opportunity and we're starting to see that accelerate. I think just when you just look at the number of patients available and I think where physicians are more comfortable now using the testing, it's in that that CRC MRD and recurrence monitoring setting. So, I would expect the vast majority will be there, but IO is certainly making a contribution and that contribution is growing. 67:10 Point me the second part of your question, I apologies? 67:19Yes. So we're still in the final stages of that, it's just a standard individual discussion with the MolDX program. I think our expectation is that's going to be roughly similar to the adjuvant colorectal pricing where there is a bundled price for the initial testing that occurs. And so, we think it will be like roughly similar to what we saw in that adjuvant bundle. 68:12 Yeah. So right now, there's really not any commercial coverage in place. I think that's an opportunity, but we're seeing -- we're seeing Medicare consistently reimbursed, but really nothing from the commercial plans. And I think that could change over time. I think that's an opportunity for upside, probably about half of the patients roughly are sort of in Medicare at this point. As we're getting volume for transplant centers and also from the committed nephrologist, there are a decent number of commercial lives there. The contribution from heart and lung is currently available on the market, we're actually seeing good utilization there, but we're very, very early stages. So those aren't really incorporated here in a meaningful way. And then Renasight is in here, it is a meaningful portion of this, but the vast majority is Prospera. 69:41 Yes. So, I think the -- what we think is the situation in California, we're still working through the details. There is going to be a lower priced offering. There is going to have very limited content. And I think we've applied for a specific PLA code from the AMA, which will signify the priced specifically for that more limited content. So, I think California is unique, they've had a state program for probably, I don't know, 20 plus years. And I think it's not something that really been deployed broadly across the United States. I think we're considering whether we participate or not at this point. If we do participate, we think there is definitely volume upside as we access additional offices that we're not currently in. So it's something we have to assess and take it from there as details emerge and as thing crystallize. 70:57 Yeah. I think -- I think the details need to be fully flushed out, but from what we understand, it would be probably 21, 13 and 18 for example only. 71:15 Sure. 71:47 Yes. So, we actually really support any additional regulatory oversight. I mean, we're already very heavily regulated today, but we've looked at this kind of valid act that's out there. We strongly support that. I think the good news is that, we are by far without a doubt the most thoroughly validated NIPT products on the market today. We have significantly more patients that have been studied in clinical trials and the largest multi-site prospective real world studies that have ever been done in this space. So, if there is regulation which we completely welcome, we're in an excellent position and we're in a probably the strongest position out of anybody. 73:00 That's [indiscernible] forward. But let me -- maybe I'll make some comments and then you can go ahead. Our experience so far hasn't been in that way, but that doesn't mean that there's no delays. I think so far we've after getting the initial colorectal coverage we then additionally submitted a tech assessment for stage IV CRC oligometastatic and we got that I think last fall. So that was a follow-on under the tech assessment process after the peer-reviewed paper came out last spring. And then obviously we got the IO coverage, which was part of the pan-cancer LCD that came out. And we submitted multiple different tech assessments at this point and we're in active discussions. 73:55 Solomon, do you want to comment further? 75:07 Yes. So the vast majority of orders that we see where the doctors requesting a protocol or in the field of CRC, but we are starting to see in the additional tumor types as doctors become comfortable they start to move to a repeat order model. So we think over time it's going to be both, but the vast majority of the volume and the repeat orders is in CRC."

During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our operational and financial outlook and projections; our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies; and expectations for various current and future products, including product capabilities, expected release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain correct or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter, unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We've got a packed session full of announcements, so let's get into the recent highlights. The very strong momentum in Q3 continued as you can see from the metrics in the first bullet. We processed 407,000 units in Q3, which was approximately 55% growth over the same period of last year. Total revenues and product revenues were both up 61% and 62%, respectively, over the same period last year. That acceleration is being driven by continued strong growth in the women's health products and big contributions from oncology and transplant products. Those products are now large enough to shift our growth rates upward. We heard a lot in the market during the quarter about the impact that Delta variant was having on the health care businesses. But as you can see from our Q3 volume, we were able to blow through any headwinds COVID-19 presented. As a result of the continued momentum, we are raising our revenue guide beyond the range we just gave a couple of months ago in August. We are now guiding revenues to be $615 million to $625 million for the full year. We started the year guiding revenues at $500 million to $525 million. So the top end of our range is now roughly $100 million above where it was at the start of the year. That gives you a sense of the traction we're having and we continue to see across the company. Mike will get into the full details of the guide later in the call. In addition to the significant unit and revenue growth, we've got a set of transformative announcements in the transplant space. In kidney, we've continued to make significant progress. First is the launch of Prospera with quantification, which is a new technique only offered by Natera that has shown improved performance over earlier methods that report donor-derived cell-free DNA fraction alone. Second is the announcement of the results of the Trifecta study, which we believe is the largest prospective, multisite, fully biopsy-matched study ever performed in the kidney transplant space. The initial results exceeded our expectations and we believe can eliminate the need for costly multi-modality approaches to bolster test performance. I'm also excited to discuss the major new Prospera commercial launches in heart and lung. In both organs, the commercial launch announcement was supported by significant new prospective data sets that we believe can redefine these fields. In oncology, the major announcements continue to unfold. We had another strong colorectal study published in clinical cancer research where we introduced Signatera velocity as a clinically useful metric. The study demonstrated the value of calculating circulating tumor DNA growth rate over time or velocity, such that patients with fast-growing tumors fear much worse than patients with slow-growing tumors. Velocity can't be calculated if you're only reporting out a positive or negative result. So we believe this will become a competitive advantage for Natera in recurrence monitoring, and we'll spend some time on this later in the call. More broadly, I think the launch of quantitative approaches in both oncology and transplant has a lot of parallels with our launch of the fetal fraction metric for Panorama back in 2013. At that time, no other NIPT reported on fetal fraction, but physicians really gravitated to our test because of that result, and the metric has now become the gold standard in a requirement for the field. These new oncology and transplant metrics provide a window into a patient's underlying biology, which can offer a physician crucial context when designing how to incorporate a test result into clinical decision-making. Our technology lends itself to these types of metrics, further differentiating the clinical utility of our products across all areas of our business. I'm pleased that Natera continues to be a leader in the industry in this area of innovation. We were also very pleased to secure another major competitive win by being selected by NRG Oncology for the U.S. arm of the CIRCULATE trial. You have seen the significance of the data sets coming out of CIRCULATE Japan, and we now think winning the critical U.S. arm puts us even further ahead in terms of developing prospective validation data for colorectal cancer. These 2 trials, together with the work we are doing with BGI in China, make up the largest commercial CRC MRD markets when you consider both the incidence and the reimbursement landscape. Although we aren't going to do a deep dive on our Signatera pharma trials today, we are now fully enrolling patients into both the Phase III IMvigor and ZEST trials we discussed on our last call, and our pharma pipeline continues to build. We are also now offering a broad plex product to our pharma partners in the RUO setting. As you're aware, Natera can multi-plex thousands of probes in a single reaction. So offering a broad plex test in the range of 50 or 100 or more targets is easy for us to do. We've only seen very targeted interest thus far in the broader plex offering. But for those who want it, we now have it available. We've been doing this kind of work upon request for a long time, but we've now made it available as part of our standard menu. In addition, Natera has developed a series of Signatera innovations that it intends to introduce in 2022 and 2023. As you know from our NIPT business, we're constantly innovating and pushing the limits of the technology. I'm also pleased to announce the progress of the clinical launch of Signatera in China with our partner BGI. Recently, BGI kicked off a multisite prospective trial in GI cancers, including colorectal cancer. The study plans to enroll roughly 500 patients and includes many of the top academic centers across China. BGI plans to expand on this initiative and is kicking off a series of investigator-initiated trials across other cancer types. Gaining support from top academic centers and KOLs is important for broader clinical launch, which requires the Chinese FDA approval and we expect will take several years to achieve. Finally, we're excited to announce the details of our road map in early cancer detection. We've signed a partnership with Aarhus University that gives us access to a prospective 40,000 sample biobank of patients screened for colorectal cancer. In addition, we've got an exclusive option to license Aarhus' IP, and we have access to their methylation signature, which is performing very well across all stages, which we plan to combine with our own methylation and ctDNA technology. As you can see, we've had a very busy quarter. I'll now jump into each of these, starting with the unit growth on the next set of slides. Our unit growth has really been accelerating recently, and I think this longer-term historical view gives us some context to the growth trajectory we've been on for the last 4 quarters. You could see that while we made steady, if lumpy, progress in prior years, the business has rocketed upward on a much steeper ramp since Q3 of last year. That is not a coincidence. In women's health, the new ACOG guidelines came out roughly 12 months ago, and we launched both our transplant and oncology products in the second half of last year. We don't think this is a 1-year trend. The NIPT market is still very underpenetrated compared to the 4 million to 5 million pregnancies in the U.S. So there's a long way to go, and of course, we are just getting started in both transplant and oncology, both of which we're starting to see play out as significant opportunities. On the next slide, you can see the volume growth is clearly translating to revenue growth as well. You can see once again the scale-up in growth we've experienced in the last year. This is driven by both the volume trends and also continued improvement in the realized revenues per test or ASP. We saw another nice increase in the blended ASPs in the business over Q2, which continues a multi-quarter trend going back to last year. We benefited from the volume mix shifting toward the newer, higher-priced products, and we also had some healthy appeals wins on older claims that came in through the quarter in women's health. Mike will spend more time on ASPs later in the call, but we still have plenty of room to run on ASPs across their various products. Okay, so we've got a fantastic set of milestones to now review in organ health. I want to start off by highlighting some broader trends that are occurring with our organ health products. First, we've expanded from a single organ product to now multiple organs with the launch of heart and lung. Our technology is robust, and we're seeing it translates well across the organs in a very cost-efficient way, which we think offers a great expansion opportunity for Natera. Second, whereas, at one point, we only had retrospective data, that's now no longer the case. We now have significant prospective multisite data. In some cases, we believe we now have the most significant prospective data in the space. Third, we focus on innovation to improve test performance. For example, with the launch of quantification and now we're seeing AUCs that are exceptional from just ctDNA alone. These trends, expanding other organs, producing high-quality, multisite prospective data sets and delivering exceptional AUC through innovation, all support a path for rapid growth in Prospera. In kidney, it's been a little more than a year since we were awarded our local coverage decision for Prospera, and we started our commercial launch in earnest, and we are very pleased with the level of commercial traction we're generating so far. Of the top 100 transplant centers, 45 have now implemented Prospera routinely into their practice. We've also been pleased with the enrollment in our registry trial, PROACTIVE, where we now have more than 2,500 patients enrolled. You may recall there was external skepticism about whether we would be able to successfully enroll patients into this trial, but clearly, we've done an exceptional job. This level of adoption among top centers just a little more than a year into the launch gives us confidence that our commercial plan is working. Now with the addition of new organs, very strong multisite prospective data and our innovative quantitative approach, we're in an even better position to build on the momentum we've seen thus far. Let me talk now for a minute about Prospera with quantification. Prospera is now the only commercially available cell-free DNA test for kidney rejection that provides 3 values: the quantity of the donor-derived cell-free DNA, the fraction of the donor-derived cell-free DNA and the total amount of cell-free DNA, on every report. Other available cell-free DNA tests only report on the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA alone, which has limitations, especially when the total cell-free DNA is high, which may result in false negatives. As you can see here on the left side of the slide, the percentage of the donor-derived cell-free DNA is a fraction that incorporates the absolute quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA as the numerator and the total amount of cell-free DNA as the denominator. The donor-derived cell-free DNA comes from the donated organ, and the total cell-free DNA mostly comes from the recipient. The fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA can change significantly if the denominator or the recipient cell-free DNA is artificially increased. When reporting donor-derived cell-free DNA fraction alone, like our competitors do, doctors need to be very careful about any factors that might impact the denominator. There are 10 items on the right hand of the slide that we've identified in the literature that can impact the total cell-free DNA. Our hypothesis was that incorporating a measurement of the absolute quantity of cell-free DNA rather than just a fractional loan into the result would improve the sensitivity of the assay, and that's exactly what we're now seeing in our studies. To test our hypothesis, we performed a validation study of the Prospera with quantification method with UCLA that resulted in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of American Nephrology, one of the premier journals. The paper showcased the improved performance from Prospera with quantification in 41 kidney transplant recipients, 9 of whom were experiencing rejection. Incorporating the quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA with the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA improve the sensitivity of the Prospera test from initially identifying 7 out of 9 cases of rejection to then 9 out of 9 cases of active rejection, which were then confirmed with biopsy. This improvement has now been seen across several different independent data sets, a number of which are in submission for publication. The most significant data set comes from the Trifecta study, which I'll go into on the next slide. Yesterday, we announced the results of the Trifecta study. The Trifecta study is a multisite prospective trial being led by Dr. Phil Halloran from the University of Alberta, a leading KOL in the field. The study, which included more than 300 biopsy match samples and greater than 100 biopsy match rejections, is the largest multisite prospective fully biopsy match study ever performed in the space. In the study, we tested the AUC of Prospera with quantification to distinguish rejection from nonrejection using BANFF 2019 criteria, and we showed an AUC of 0.81. We then used molecular pathology as the standard and showed an AUC of 0.89. There are recent studies that suggest that molecular pathology may be a better standard than BANFF, suggesting that Prospera may be performing better than previously suspected. Finally, we also compared rejection versus quiescence crescents or essentially, rejection versus exceptionally stable patients, resulting in AUC of 0.91. This last analysis, the comparison of rejection to quiescence is similar in concept to that used by some of our competitors in their recent multi-modality publications. Unfortunately, it isn't a very useful analysis clinically, which I'll touch on in a minute. Overall, the AUCs from the Trifecta study are exceptional. The definitive data is now in. Prospera with quantification performed very well, and Natera now has the largest fully biopsy match study that's ever been performed in the kidney transplant space. I want to take a second to quickly touch on rejection versus quiescence because it's easy to get confused on the different types of analyses that are out there. Rejection versus nonrejection is different from rejection versus quiescence. Quiescence includes essentially only the most stable of stable patients. As you can see below, this type of analysis excludes intermediate patients, which it really isn't practical in a real-world setting. In most cases, it's not possible to determine a patient is quiescent without doing a biopsy first to determine if there are any nonrejection pathological findings. That is why the vast majority of the papers in the field have assessed rejection versus nonrejection, which remains the main benchmark for performance. As you assess the landscape of testing available, keep in mind that the analysis being performed may be different than the intended use population, and just - and thus, the results may be less clinically useful. So far from what we've seen, multi-modality approaches have not been validated in rejection versus nonrejection cohorts, and their performance in that intended use population remains to be seen. On the next slide, I'm really pleased to provide details on the recent launch of Prospera in the heart transplant setting. As I said before, it's been relatively easy for us to expand beyond kidney to other organs because of our robust core technology. In addition, it's also proving to be commercially efficient because we're able to leverage a lot of the same infrastructure in terms of nurse coordinators and customer support. So it's also been cost-efficient for us to enter this space. We think Prospera Heart offers compelling advantages versus our competing tests. Our validation study is a multisite study that included greater than 250 prospective samples collected during 2020 and 2021 for the purpose of validating Prospera Heart and another 100 samples from a biopsy match biobank. You can see the results of the study on the right-hand side of the page. The initial results were impressive, but then further improved with quantification where we were able to achieve an area under the curve of 0.88. These are really exceptional AUCs in the heart transplant monitoring space, further underscoring the power of our technology. What's critical about these results is that the Prospera Heart test is delivering this exceptional AUC by performing cell-free DNA alone, and therefore, we believe there is no need for cumbersome and costly multi-modality approaches to bolster test performance. Competitor test in heart must be collected at a site that is set up for specialized handling because the sample must be immediately spun down and shipped on dry ice. Since our test is a simple blood test, patients can access our convenient mobile phlebotomy service, which can be important given the frequency of testing. In addition, the competitive test in heart charges Medicare twice for every multi-modality patient time point since separate DNA and RNA tests are being performed on each patient. Because we are delivering excellent performance on a cell-free DNA-based test alone, Prospera Heart reduces the cost of the system and is less than half the price of the expensive multi-modality approaches. We think this combination of test performance, convenience and cost represents a compelling offering for physicians and patients. We keep the product expansion opportunities rolling on the next page with our lung transplant launch. We are getting a lot of the same efficiencies with this launch, the same robust Prospera workflow and leveraging a lot of the same commercial infrastructure that we've built. The sales and commercial teams overlap with the heart team, so again, it's very efficient for us to go after this opportunity. We think the validation data and results in lung are very strong. The study was run by the lung transplant program at the Ohio State University, was presented at CHEST a few weeks ago and very well received. Prospective study examined 204 plasma samples obtained with concurrent bronchoscopy biopsy procedures from 104 lung transplant recipients between September of 2020 and June of 2021. Using the Prospera lung test, donor-derived cell-free DNA levels were compared across clinical histopathologic diagnostic cohorts. During the study, 35 episodes of acute rejection were analyzed. This study represents the largest trial of a commercially available donor-derived cell-free DNA test for lung transplant assessment. And once again, the AUC was incredibly strong, underscoring the power of our technology. For both the heart and lung products, we plan to submit dossiers for Medicare reimbursement under the existing local coverage decision, and we anticipate receiving coverage in 2022. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting opportunities. We've made a lot of progress in kidney. And we're now expanding to other organs. We've been hard at work in developing very strong data sets, and now we have, in some cases, the largest prospective data sets available. We're innovating. We're launching improvements such as Prospera with quantification. We're seeing exceptional AUCs. I think we're in an excellent position long term to compete very well in the organ health space. I'm going to hand it over to Solomon in a minute to walk through all the recent news on Signatera, but first, I want to spend a moment describing the effort we have underway in early cancer detection. Our strategy here is to pursue a capital-efficient development program that is not distracted from the work we are doing with Signatera, but instead leverages the technology we are already developing, along with the data we are generating with our growing base of clinical volumes in oncology. That last item is critical because we run an upfront exome on every Signatera sample. We're accumulating a data set of tens of thousands of early-stage cancer exomes that has never existed before. We can now interrogate that data set to assist in the design of a DNA-based signature that maximizes test performance. We've already completed the initial design of the colorectal cancer early screening DNA component. Now we're excited to validate and expand on that effort with our new partnership with Aarhus University. In the partnership, we've secured access to a biobank of 40,000 colorectal screening samples, prospectively collected and would match outcomes data. More than half of the affected samples are stage I or II cancers. We've also secured an exclusive option to license IP and access to a methylation signature from Aarhus, which demonstrated strong potential in a recently published study. The methylation signature alone reported an average sensitivity of 85% with a specificity of 99% across stage I through IV colorectal cancers. The performance was also very strong in early-stage cancers with an 80% sensitivity in stage I and 85% sensitivity in stage II cancers. We'll, of course, need to replicate these results, and we also believe we can improve upon the methylation signature by incorporating it into our own unique methylation workflow and adding in our DNA technology. We'll start off with the colorectal assay and then have the potential to add additional cancer types in the future. So while we continue to build on our lead with Signatera and MRD, we've got a targeted program running in this adjacent and very large market. I look forward to providing periodic updates on our progress here in the future. With that, let me now hand it over to Solomon to cover the other oncology updates. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. I want to start on the next slide with our selection as the MRD partner for the U.S. arm of the CIRCULATE trial. We were very pleased to win a competitive process for this trial, which is funded by NCI, the National Cancer Institute, and led by NRG Oncology, a leading academic consortium with hundreds of clinical sites across the U.S. We have just started to see some of the potential for practice-changing data emerge from the Japanese arm of the CIRCULATE trial. And we think the U.S. arm is similarly destined to be the definitive prospective U.S. trial for MRD-guided management of colorectal cancer. You can see a summary of the trial design on the right-hand side of the page. Stage II and III colon cancer patients will get surgery as per the standard of care and then get serial MRD assessment with Signatera. Patients that are MRD-positive on Signatera will go on to chemotherapy, and that will be randomized between standard of care chemo, which is 3 to 6 months of FOLFOX; or an intensified regimen with FOLFIRINOX, which is standard treatment today for patients diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer. Also, just like in CIRCULATE Japan, Signatera MRD-negative patients will be randomized as well between standard of care, chemotherapy, versus no chemotherapy at all, just active surveillance. This is called de-escalation. We've highlighted this arm of the study on the slide because we believe it can eliminate unnecessary treatment for the majority of patients. Right now, adjuvant chemotherapy is standard for all stage III and high-risk stage II patients, even though we know that most patients are already cured by surgery alone and will not benefit from the chemotherapy. The Japanese group may be able to report preliminary results from this de-escalation arm in the next year, and we think those results plus the data from the U.S. will be enough to impact NCCN guidelines and could make it very unlikely that a study like this would ever be run again. I think this really highlights our competitive advantage as we have developed a multiyear lead in prospective clinical data, and we think winning this trial is going to significantly extend that leadership position. Okay. Excited to get into a little more detail now on the new velocity data that Steve touched on earlier in his opening comments. In early October, we published a prospective study with 168 stage III colorectal cancer patients with a total of just over 1,200 blood samples analyzed. First of all, the study recapitulated our strong test performance in early-stage CRC that we published before, this time with a nice homogeneous population of stage III colorectal cancer. But in addition, we also introduced and validated the new concept of ctDNA velocity. So as Steve mentioned, Signatera gives more than a qualitative positive or negative result. Every Signatera test result comes with a count of tumor molecules per milliliter of plasma, which represents disease burden. As patients receive serial testing over time, physicians are able to monitor both the direction and the rate of change in that disease burden. You can visually see this rate of change on the chart on the right-hand side of the page. So each line represents one patient with ctDNA levels tracked over multiple time points. You see the patients represented by the light-blue lines have ctDNA levels increasing rapidly, while the patients represented by the dark-blue lines have ctDNA that is still present, but it's growing more slowly. The data from this study confirms the intuition that patients with fast-growing tumors have much worse outcomes. So specifically, the box on the bottom left makes clear how stark the difference is. While all MRD-positive patients ultimately went on to relapse, for patients with fast-growing tumors, less than half of them were still alive at the 3-year mark. Meanwhile, for patients with slow-growing tumors, 100% of them were still alive at the 3-year mark. We expect this prognostic feature to become increasingly important for oncologists as they work out exactly how to manage their MRD-positive colorectal patients. And we also expect the concept to apply in other cancer types, similar to how PSA velocity is already measured today for prostate cancer. To our knowledge, Signatera is the only MRD test that has been validated for the assessment of ctDNA velocity, which is made possible by our unique approach to quantitation. So I'm not going to touch on everything we have going on today in oncology because of time. But as Steve said at the top of the call, we're making a lot of progress in pharma in China and of course, with product innovation. So we're looking forward to provide more updates on those fronts in the future. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Mike to discuss the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The next slide here is just the summary of financial results for the quarter. Steve covered a lot of the trends on volumes and revenues. You see the revenue growth modestly outstripping the volume growth as ASP stepped up in the quarter. Underlying ASPs for our products stepped up modestly again in Q3 as we continue to add some wins from additional NIPT coverage. We also benefited from roughly $5 million in revenue from cash collections from prior periods, which historically is more in the $1 million to $2 million range but can be lumpy as we've discussed in the past. I called that out to give you some context for the revenue guide for the rest of the year, which implies significant sequential organic growth in Q4. We also got a bump in our realized collections per unit for Signatera from the ADLT pricing going into effect in Q3. We think that ADLT will continue to help grow Signatera ASPs as more and more patients that started with Signatera this year moved to the recurrence monitoring setting, which is covered by the ADLT pricing. Overall, though, we've chosen to let Signatera ASPs be much lower than they otherwise could be because we are taking in growing volumes from a range of indications that are not yet reimbursed. Signatera adoption across cancer types has exceeded our expectations so far, which is tough on gross margins in the immediate term but we think is a very bullish sign for the longer-term potential of this market. You can see we improved gross margins meaningfully year-over-year, but still, our gross margin for this quarter and for the rest of the year reflects this investment, if you will, in test volume ahead of reimbursement, particularly for Signatera. And that's been balanced out by a strong and growing gross margins for our NIPT and Horizon products that are now well above the blended average. To that point, COGS per unit in the quarter were on track as NIPT COGS remained in the 150 range, and the path to reducing COGS over time remains intact. But we still have a road map in place to meaningfully reduce Signatera COGS per unit over time, as we've discussed in the past. As we covered on our Q2 call, the R&D and SG&A lines also reflect the significant upfront investment we are making in oncology. In research and development, we are adding staff to execute on scaling the lab, along with the fulsome slate of clinical trial work we are doing with academic and pharma partners. We've said before that we are not planning to sit back with our current product offerings with Version 1.0 of Signatera and Prospera. And I think the updates Steve and Solomon provided make clear how quickly we can turn OpEx investments into differentiating new features for Signatera and Prospera, in addition to the entirely new product launches Steve covered. This productivity also allows us to get more scale more quickly on the commercial operation we've built for these call points. We've needed to build sales channels into transplant and oncology setting this year, but now we can leverage these sales channels across organ types in transplant and a huge range of cancer types in oncology. Okay. So I think that now gives you some background for the guide that's on the next slide. We are raising the revenue guide for the third time this year. As Steve discussed, this is a function of our efforts hitting on all cylinders across products with commercial wins coming from all the new data we have generated and the sales teams getting increasingly productive in the transplant and oncology call points. We are trending slightly on gross margins versus the most recent guide but still better than where we started the year. This is driven by the new volumes outside of what's currently reimbursed is accelerating, as I described, and we think that's definitely worth doing. The build-out of the commercial effort continues to roll out as we described this summer. So we are holding that steady for the rest of the year. And we are bumping up R&D to accelerate our participation in a range of clinical trials that have become available to us with the performance we've seen in both Prospera and Signatera. We are still very comfortable with where we stand on the balance sheet. We can see the demand for our products in the field, and we see opportunities to capture share in markets that can endure for a very long time. So we think the decision to remain in aggressive growth mode remains the right one. So it's an exciting time for Natera, and we are very pleased to have been able to share these results with you. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Please goa head.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys good evening. Steve, one for you on the Aarhus biobank sample project. Can you share some color on time lines for the launch and completion of your validation study? And at what point do you expect to launch a prospective trial and launch commercially? And then I have a quick follow-up on the guide.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, thanks for the questions. So we're really excited about this partnership. I mean the methylation data that they published looks very strong. The biobank obviously is very significant, so we're very pleased to get access to this. We hope to generate some combined data on the performance of DNA and the sort of Version 2 of the methylation platform in 2022. But there's still a lot of work to do, so we're not putting out any time lines right now, but we do think we can generate some data during that time frame. That doesn't necessarily mean we'll complete the entire validation of the 40,000 sample cohort in that time frame, but just that we would make some additional data available on the combined performance of the assay. Frankly, we actually hope that we can use this cohort itself to go to the FDA. We plan on going and speaking with the FDA about the use of this cohort. We ultimately don't know what they're going to say, and we're not sort of hanging our hat on the fact that they're going to accept this as the final validation. So once we go through that process, we'll have more insight into whether we need to execute a prospective trial or not. But certainly, this cohort alone will provide, I think, very strong validation data that will give us significant confidence about making that decision to move forward and make the investment in a prospective cohort, if we do that.\nTejas Savant: Got it. Very helpful. And then, Mike, a quick follow-up on the guide. I mean as you look at the fourth quarter in '22, anything to worry here in terms of supply chain disruptions or consumable shortages or even sample shipping delays that could constrain upside in the near term for you?\nMichael Brophy: No, I don't think so, Tejas. I mean you can see what the - the implied growth in Q4, I think, tells you that all the trends that we're seeing here in Q3 are looking really stable. It's not really - not a onetime benefit or anything like that. And so we were able to blow right through any concerns related to the Delta variant, as you can see in our Q3 performance. So maybe that affected us, but you just can't tell that in the numbers. So we're feeling great about the trajectory that we're on.\nOperator: Thank you, And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey thanks and Congrats on all the progress, guys. On Prospera, is Prospera with quantification, is that an incremental pricing opportunity? Or is that more about capturing market share? And then secondly, on Prospera, obviously, your competitor has got in a fair amount of trouble. I'm just curious if there's blowback and how you think about that. I know there's not a direct read-through for you guys. And then I had one follow-up on screening after that.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So the Prospera with quantification technique is obviously something that's unique to Natera. It's performing exceptionally well. We've designed this in a way that we really don't have to do any additional workflow. And so although I think we could go try to take price, we made the decision to just pass this through as a benefit to patients and to physicians without increasing the price in any way. But it's an exceptionally streamlined workflow where we've leveraged some novel microbiology and novel bioinformatics techniques to be able to provide this without really increasing our COGS. With regards to some of the challenges with the competitive landscape, we don't think that there's any blowback to Natera. I think we're in a very good position, and we look forward to competing hard.\nTycho Peterson: And then on the screening, I'm just curious...\nSteve Chapman: There's one last one there.\nTycho Peterson: Go ahead. Yes. On screening, I was just curious how you're thinking about kind of the multi-cancer opportunity. I mean, obviously, it's great you've got the biobank of 40,000 samples for colorectal. But as we think about additional cancer indications, any rough sense of the time line? I mean will this be over the next year or 2? Or how do you think about multi-cancer?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I think our plan includes the ability to extend into additional cancers, and I think we've enabled that opportunity through the partnership with Aarhus. As far as our internal methylation and DNA discovery work, we've built discovery platforms that aren't specific to colorectal that can extend into other cancer opportunities. So while our initial focus is on generating a proof of concept and then validation data for colorectal moving towards the commercial launch, longer term, our plan is to have a pan-cancer assay. But the initial work will be focused on colorectal.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open, Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Just on the screening point, I just wanted to understand how are you positioning in terms of potential trial there for CRC. And in terms of given the competition that's already out there, there are 3 trials in the space. So just wanted to understand how you're positioning for that. And for the multi-cancer timing for these trials, the large-scale trials, those are obviously more than 50,000-patient or 100,000-patient trials. So how are you thinking about that sort of investment overall and the timing for that?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I mean our approach, thus far, is to take a very sort of cost-efficient approach and sort of have some phase gates as we move along here. And so far, we've leveraged the significant amount of information that we have coming from all the tumor exomes that we've run, and we use that to build a proprietary DNA-only aspect of the test. Now we're combining that with this methylation signature that we gained access to through the partnership with Aarhus and is performing very well, plus some internal discovery work and methylation workflow work that we're doing at Natera. So we plan on putting those 2 things together, generating some proof-of-concept data in early '22 and then running the 40,000 sample biobank thereafter. Our hope is that, that 40,000 biobank itself is enough for us to get approval from the FDA for the test. Now we don't know if that's the case. We haven't yet gone and spoken with the FDA when it's very likely that it won't, in fact, be sufficient to get approval, but that's what we hope. And if that turns out to be the case, that would be a massive win for us because we wouldn't then subsequently have to do the prospective study. I think we plan on having that conversation with the FDA sooner rather than later, so we can understand if we do have to do a prospective trial, we can start planning for that and start executing on that. Now in colorectal alone, we think that the trial - when you look around it, competitive trials are taken like in that kind of 3-year range. Now that's okay because we don't have to be the first test on the market. I think this is such a huge opportunity that it's not necessarily just about being the first on the market; it's about doing it right and having the right test, having the right customer experience, having the right performance. So if we see in the proof of concept and the subsequent validation data that we really have something here that we think is going to be a winner, we're not going to hesitate to pull the trigger on that prospective trial. As far as the much broader expansion to pan-cancer, we're going to have to get through some of these phase gates and hit some of these milestones before we can really talk about the time line for doing a prospective study of that size.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That's super helpful. And then on Signatera, I just wanted to get a sense of the sort of the catalyst path ahead, events that we ought to be watching out for in terms of data sets and readouts for Signatera. We obviously saw your data on Yeovil [ph] and a number of other data sets. So there is momentum here. But in - sort of in terms of thinking of larger indications, more impactful studies, just if you could just walk us through what are some of the things to watch out for and the potential conferences where we should be expecting more data readouts around Signatera that are more meaningful.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Sure. So I'll make the comment and then maybe, Solomon, you could comment. So we have, I think, more than 50 different trials that are ongoing at any time or biobanks that are ongoing at any time, and various of those are going to be reading out over the next kind of quarter, the next 6 months, the next 12 months. So we've got a lot of data coming out, and that's really sort of broad across different cancer types. I'm not going to go through and sort of name each one, but there's additional data in GI. There's additional data in some of the cancer types like melanoma, for example, or other areas where we haven't had significant readouts that we're pretty excited about. So stay tuned for what's coming. I do think, in the near term, one of the most significant readouts, or has the potential to be one of the most significant readouts, is coming at the ASCO GI Conference in the beginning of 2022 where we expect there to be another very significant report on the CIRCULATE Japan study in the colorectal space. And I think that's going to be exciting, and I think that has the potential to be market changing Solomon, do you want to add any additional comments there?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. I want to reiterate our - looking forward to the data at ASCO GI, we also have multiple studies that have been submitted as manuscripts that are under review across many different GI cancers as well as skin cancer, ovarian cancer, some of the data, which you'd - people had seen previously in a conference, multiple myeloma. And then, we have - we're looking at a pretty exciting slate of abstracts to send to AACR as well, which will be in the spring. And I think it's a little early to say exactly to what extent - how we're going to use these for - to extend our reimbursement pathway. So we have those discussions with Medicare and with our other payers, but there's a lot to look forward to here.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Super helpful. And last one, if I could just squeeze in. In terms of ADLT reimbursement, was there any contribution in the quarter? And I apologize if I missed that.\nMichael Brophy: Yes.\nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, I'll take it. Yes. So we did get a modest bump in the quarter from the ADLT pricing, and I think that's something that can be a continued tailwind for Signatera clinical volumes in these kind of reimbursed cancers, particularly as you get more and more patients that have started Signatera that go through that first - that 6-month kind of adjuvant window, and then they go - they flip into the recurrence monitoring indication. That's the indication that's reimbursed under the ADLT. So as you kind of build a bigger base of patients that have kind of gone through that first 6 months, the mix of your volumes is going to shift toward that recurrence monitoring indication, and that will tend to be a tailwind for ASPs. But we did start to see a little bit of that in Q3.\nPuneet Souda: Super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open, Please go ahead.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey guys, thanks for the questions. I guess first for Signatera. I believe you were waiting on the IO or umbrella LCD to be finalized, and then you could submit data packets for other indications to amend the billing article. Is that still your plan? And if so, what are the indications that you kind of have ready to go once we have a final LCD? And then, obviously, Medicare is running behind the schedule here. Have you heard anything from them in terms of timing?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Catherine. So just first on the timing. I think we had initially understood that the final LCD had to publish publicly in September. However, we've now clarified that September was the deadline for MolDx to send the LCD to CMS National for approval. And we understand that that's taking place. We've had a lot of consistent and positive dialogue with the MolDx program, and their feedback is that the administrative process is just ongoing. And ultimately, it's their process, but everything we've heard makes us think that it's on track and it's going to be published soon. And so we'll have more updates on the time line as we get them. As far as submitting additional indications, you can basically go back and look at anywhere where we published a paper, a muscle invasive bladder cancer, neoadjuvant breast, lung, et cetera, anywhere where we published a paper, we think we're eligible to submit for reimbursement. And as Solomon said a moment ago, we have other papers in ovarian and so forth that are already submitted where we've - in some cases, we've gotten editor comments back already, and so we have a pipeline of papers coming out. And as a reminder, we've already submitted our tech assessment for stage IV colorectal cancer, which we think would fall under the CRC LCD, which is already in final stage.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay, got it. And then, maybe just going back to early detection; can you just talk through how you envision that playing out commercially? Is this something you plug into your women's health channel? Or do you plan to go after the primary care market as well?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I think there's some different options there. I mean, look, we're - we still got a long way to go before we're actually pulling the trigger on commercialization. So ultimately, if we have a product that works well that's reimbursed, the commercialization part is easy, and that's something that we do exceptionally well. So I think we'll have to deal with that when the time comes. But our women's health channel, I think, is an exceptional channel for commercialization. We're now broadly covering the vast majority of women's health providers. And as you know, many women use their OB/GYN or GYN as a primary care provider. But yes, lots of opportunities for commercialization, and we'll cross that bridge in the future.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Max Masucci with Cowen.\nMax Masucci: Congrats on a great update across the board. To start, it's been over 8 months since the launch of Altera. Still early days, but how has the adoption then? Have customers been purchasing more on a stand-alone basis? Or are most using the test in tandem with Signatera?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Max. So things are going well. I think, obviously, Signatera as a whole is going well. I mean I'm looking at our volume growth just in that clinical sector, and I think we're growing exceptionally well there. I think Altera generally has been ordered alongside Signatera. That's how we've been promoting it thus far. We really haven't been promoting it as a stand-alone indication. I think we might in the future, but Signatera is such an enormous market that I think we want to keep our energy focused there. And as we bring on additional products in this space, whether that be tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling or a liquid biopsy-based comprehensive genomic profile, we're going to do it in the context of supporting Signatera.\nMax Masucci: Yes. Makes sense. Maybe one question for Mike on the core NIPT business. Are you still seeing around 80% of NIPT tests include add-on microdeletions testing? And I think you're getting paid somewhere in the range of 5% to 10% of those microdeletions volumes about 1.5 years ago. Has the attachment rate for microdeletions testing or the percentage of volumes that you're paid on changed at all over the past 1.5 years?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Thanks for the question, Max. Yes, so on microdels, the attachment rate has remained remarkably stable. It's - any given quarter, it's in that 75% to 80% attachment to NIPT within our direct channel. And the pricing for microdeletions in terms of our contracted rates with commercial payers is remarkably similar to that which we have with NIPT. I mean the contracted rates are in that kind of $600 range for microdeletions as a stand-alone product. So a lot of volume that we run, a lot of results when you return to patients and then submit for reimbursement with a constructive contracted rate. And then as you alluded to, the last time we get paid is quite low. So I mean, percent paid rates on microdels are in that kind of single-digit percentage kind of range, and so the resulting in ASPs are - it's only a few bucks out of ASP. That can change really meaningfully when we can get the publication out on the SMART data that we talked about earlier this year. And if we can use that data to see some guideline revisions in favor of microdeletions testing. So I think that's something that we're very excited about seeing more developments on going into 2022.\nMax Masucci: Make sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nAlexander Nowak: Very good afternoon, everyone. What is your sales team hearing out in the field among OB/GYNs? Is that level of training around average risk now increasing with the ACOG decision out there? And then does the field commentary at all change your expectations of this market ultimately having 80% to 90% penetration? And then just what is penetration right now?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks. So I think, obviously, since the guideline came out about a year - a little over a year ago, we've seen an acceleration in the percentage of business that we're doing that's average risk versus high risk, and that's something that we tracked. We've also seen just an acceleration in volume overall. I think there's still some big opportunities where average risk is not fully rolled out yet, whether that's big MFM practices that are still sort of working through exactly how they're going to offer it and how they're going to roll it out to their community-based OB/GYN practices; or whether it's big hospital systems that are sort of working through exactly how they're going to integrate it routinely into practice; or whether it's state Medicaid programs that are figuring out how they're going to deal with coverage. So it's not sort of this overnight switch where everybody immediately starts doing the testing. But we still do firmly believe that, that sort of 90%-plus market penetration will be hit in this sort of 3-year time frame. And that matches, I think, to the prior testing methodologies on the market. I think that we're kind of tapping out maybe low 80s, but given some of the performance improvements in NIPT, I do think you'll get to that kind of 90% penetration range. We think, overall, high-risk testing is probably in the high 70s, low 80s. An average risk testing is probably in the kind of high 20s, maybe low 30s at this point. And we think Natera's market share now is close to 40% or something in that range. We track our market share, and we can see the competitive market shares as well through these detailed market surveys that we do. And we've been gaining share relative to the rest of the market, and we hope that trend continues.\nAlexander Nowak: And if you take that penetration benefits still to go on prenatal, Signatera still in this very early phase of launch, just in a single cancer and then the big efforts you're making here in transplant, how are you thinking about growth going into 2022?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Well, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of stuff going on, continuing to execute well across the business, a lot of exciting momentum in transplant as we announced today. A lot of exciting momentum on Signatera, very, very long way to go in NIPT. So there's a lot of excitement. Mike, do you want to comment specifically on sort of how we're thinking about forecasting or what we're thinking about for '22?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. I mean, I think that the trends that you saw in Q3, we think, are pretty stable trends. I think you can see that through the guide that we have out there now for the full year. And we've got a couple of pretty important product launches going with Natera and Prospera, and there's a lot for us to learn as we go through the next quarter or so on those launches. So I mean, I anticipate providing a guide for '22 on kind of the typical time line. We'll give an update at the JPMorgan conference, and then we'll likely return with the formal guide in Q4, but all these kind of trends, you can kind of see them. Q2 and Q3 have been pretty stable and quite constructive.\nAlexander Nowak: Thanks for the update, I appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next questions comes from the line of Mark Massaro with BTIG. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nMark Massaro: Hey guys, Congrats on a strong quarter. I guess curious when you'd be able to comment on how much revenue contribution you're getting from transplant and oncology. For what it's worth, I'm modeling about $20 million apiece for the full year of '21. And so that's the first part. The second part is that I've seen some data that would suggest that the transplant centers are using both your test as well as the market leader at this current juncture. And I haven't seen much evidence that we're seeing the incumbent getting swapped out for you. And the other thing I'm hearing is that a lot of the revenue that perhaps you're generating is coming from registry trials as opposed to full-blown clinical use. I'd be curious if you could comment on those 3.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Maybe I'll comment on the transplant stuff, and then, Mike, you could comment on the rest.\nMichael Brophy: Yes.\nSteve Chapman: I think when you look at - I think we showed a slide today that about 45 of the top 100 transplant centers are using Prospera regularly. I think that probably including some centers that are splitting with CareDx, but that certainly includes some where we displaced CareDx, and they're using a very significant amount of testing. I think, look, the - we've always seen a diagnostic. Some doctors want to use 2 different providers, or maybe different doctors within a center want to use 2 different providers, and that's fine because the overall market is still about kind of 8%, 9%, 10% penetrated. And there's just a very long way to go here in kidney. And now we're talking about going into heart. We've launched to go into lung, and there's other organs that we think are going to be important in the future as well. So it's a long way to go. As far as registry trials and so forth, I think that that's not accurate. It's just simply not true. There's a very small portion of the business that we're doing that's part of a registry trial, and the remainder is commercial testing.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. And I'll pick up on - just on the breaking out of the different products. I think, for us, it's a matter of just getting to learn how these products perform quarter-to-quarter and what the right trends are, what the right growth trends are, so that we can feel great that we're accurately forecasting them and then being able to share those with you guys. Similar to my comment on the last question is that we clearly still have a lot to learn with these products. I mean I think in a lot of ways, Q3, it was really the first full quarter where we had sales teams in place, and they had been in place long enough to kind of know which end is up and have a lot territory and be able to be productive. And so, it's not long until we'll be able to give more detail and give more guidance on it. But we're at the - at the moment, we're still learning and still watching the launches happen.\nMark Massaro: Awesome. And then if I can sneak one last one in. Congrats on the 40,000 samples from the university in Europe. I guess can you speak to why you decided to pursue that option as opposed to something else? And then I'm just curious, the - I believe the university is based in Denmark. Can you speak to the homogeneity of - or heterogeneity of the samples and whether or not you think that the sample types would be rich enough for U.S. equivalents.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I think the first thing is, the public health sector there, I think, does an exceptional job of collecting these extensive outcomes data, and that's what gives you the opportunity to piggyback on something as exceptional as a well-curated 40,000 sample biobank. Part of the reason why we partner with them is because they have this exceptional biobank, they have great researchers, and they this methylation signature that is delivering just exceptional performance. If you look at, I think, across the different stages, 85% sensitivity with a 99% specificity, that by itself actually is exceptional. We're augmenting that to include our own methylation targets and DNA signature that we've mined from tens of thousands of colorectal exomes. So the partnership made sense based on what they brought to the table, what we brought to the table, and again, it's a cost-efficient way for us to go after this. As far as the population goes, I mean, look, that's one of the things we've got to have discussions about when we go for a pre-submission meeting with the FDA, among other things. And as I said before, look, this probably or may not end up being the end-all, be-all set that we need to get the test reimbursed. We hope it will be, and we think we have a good case when we go make the pre-submission meeting. But ultimately, we might end up having to do a prospective trial. Now, if the test performs as we expect it to and we continue to believe the market opportunity is as big as we think and others think it is, we will not hesitate to pull the trigger and run that trial, even if we're not going to be the first to market, which we don't think matters. If you look at NIPT, we were the fourth to market multiple years after others, and now we have 40% share. So you want to have the best test, you want to have the best distribution, the best customer experience, and you don't have to be first to market to deliver that.\nMark Massaro: Great. Congrats, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. And also, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. I want to start on the next slide with our selection as the MRD partner for the U.S. arm of the CIRCULATE trial. We were very pleased to win a competitive process for this trial, which is funded by NCI, the National Cancer Institute, and led by NRG Oncology, a leading academic consortium with hundreds of clinical sites across the U.S. We have just started to see some of the potential for practice-changing data emerge from the Japanese arm of the CIRCULATE trial. And we think the U.S. arm is similarly destined to be the definitive prospective U.S. trial for MRD-guided management of colorectal cancer. You can see a summary of the trial design on the right-hand side of the page. Stage II and III colon cancer patients will get surgery as per the standard of care and then get serial MRD assessment with Signatera. Patients that are MRD-positive on Signatera will go on to chemotherapy, and that will be randomized between standard of care chemo, which is 3 to 6 months of FOLFOX; or an intensified regimen with FOLFIRINOX, which is standard treatment today for patients diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer. Also, just like in CIRCULATE Japan, Signatera MRD-negative patients will be randomized as well between standard of care, chemotherapy, versus no chemotherapy at all, just active surveillance. This is called de-escalation. We've highlighted this arm of the study on the slide because we believe it can eliminate unnecessary treatment for the majority of patients. Right now, adjuvant chemotherapy is standard for all stage III and high-risk stage II patients, even though we know that most patients are already cured by surgery alone and will not benefit from the chemotherapy. The Japanese group may be able to report preliminary results from this de-escalation arm in the next year, and we think those results plus the data from the U.S. will be enough to impact NCCN guidelines and could make it very unlikely that a study like this would ever be run again. I think this really highlights our competitive advantage as we have developed a multiyear lead in prospective clinical data, and we think winning this trial is going to significantly extend that leadership position. Okay. Excited to get into a little more detail now on the new velocity data that Steve touched on earlier in his opening comments. In early October, we published a prospective study with 168 stage III colorectal cancer patients with a total of just over 1,200 blood samples analyzed. First of all, the study recapitulated our strong test performance in early-stage CRC that we published before, this time with a nice homogeneous population of stage III colorectal cancer. But in addition, we also introduced and validated the new concept of ctDNA velocity. So as Steve mentioned, Signatera gives more than a qualitative positive or negative result. Every Signatera test result comes with a count of tumor molecules per milliliter of plasma, which represents disease burden. As patients receive serial testing over time, physicians are able to monitor both the direction and the rate of change in that disease burden. You can visually see this rate of change on the chart on the right-hand side of the page. So each line represents one patient with ctDNA levels tracked over multiple time points. You see the patients represented by the light-blue lines have ctDNA levels increasing rapidly, while the patients represented by the dark-blue lines have ctDNA that is still present, but it's growing more slowly. The data from this study confirms the intuition that patients with fast-growing tumors have much worse outcomes. So specifically, the box on the bottom left makes clear how stark the difference is. While all MRD-positive patients ultimately went on to relapse, for patients with fast-growing tumors, less than half of them were still alive at the 3-year mark. Meanwhile, for patients with slow-growing tumors, 100% of them were still alive at the 3-year mark. We expect this prognostic feature to become increasingly important for oncologists as they work out exactly how to manage their MRD-positive colorectal patients. And we also expect the concept to apply in other cancer types, similar to how PSA velocity is already measured today for prostate cancer. To our knowledge, Signatera is the only MRD test that has been validated for the assessment of ctDNA velocity, which is made possible by our unique approach to quantitation. So I'm not going to touch on everything we have going on today in oncology because of time. But as Steve said at the top of the call, we're making a lot of progress in pharma in China and of course, with product innovation. So we're looking forward to provide more updates on those fronts in the future. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Mike to discuss the financials. Mike? Sure. I want to reiterate our - looking forward to the data at ASCO GI, we also have multiple studies that have been submitted as manuscripts that are under review across many different GI cancers as well as skin cancer, ovarian cancer, some of the data, which you'd - people had seen previously in a conference, multiple myeloma. And then, we have - we're looking at a pretty exciting slate of abstracts to send to AACR as well, which will be in the spring. And I think it's a little early to say exactly to what extent - how we're going to use these for - to extend our reimbursement pathway. So we have those discussions with Medicare and with our other payers, but there's a lot to look forward to here."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We've got a packed session full of announcements, so let's get into the recent highlights. The very strong momentum in Q3 continued as you can see from the metrics in the first bullet. We processed 407,000 units in Q3, which was approximately 55% growth over the same period of last year. Total revenues and product revenues were both up 61% and 62%, respectively, over the same period last year. That acceleration is being driven by continued strong growth in the women's health products and big contributions from oncology and transplant products. Those products are now large enough to shift our growth rates upward. We heard a lot in the market during the quarter about the impact that Delta variant was having on the health care businesses. But as you can see from our Q3 volume, we were able to blow through any headwinds COVID-19 presented. As a result of the continued momentum, we are raising our revenue guide beyond the range we just gave a couple of months ago in August. We are now guiding revenues to be $615 million to $625 million for the full year. We started the year guiding revenues at $500 million to $525 million. So the top end of our range is now roughly $100 million above where it was at the start of the year. That gives you a sense of the traction we're having and we continue to see across the company. Mike will get into the full details of the guide later in the call. In addition to the significant unit and revenue growth, we've got a set of transformative announcements in the transplant space. In kidney, we've continued to make significant progress. First is the launch of Prospera with quantification, which is a new technique only offered by Natera that has shown improved performance over earlier methods that report donor-derived cell-free DNA fraction alone. Second is the announcement of the results of the Trifecta study, which we believe is the largest prospective, multisite, fully biopsy-matched study ever performed in the kidney transplant space. The initial results exceeded our expectations and we believe can eliminate the need for costly multi-modality approaches to bolster test performance. I'm also excited to discuss the major new Prospera commercial launches in heart and lung. In both organs, the commercial launch announcement was supported by significant new prospective data sets that we believe can redefine these fields. In oncology, the major announcements continue to unfold. We had another strong colorectal study published in clinical cancer research where we introduced Signatera velocity as a clinically useful metric. The study demonstrated the value of calculating circulating tumor DNA growth rate over time or velocity, such that patients with fast-growing tumors fear much worse than patients with slow-growing tumors. Velocity can't be calculated if you're only reporting out a positive or negative result. So we believe this will become a competitive advantage for Natera in recurrence monitoring, and we'll spend some time on this later in the call. More broadly, I think the launch of quantitative approaches in both oncology and transplant has a lot of parallels with our launch of the fetal fraction metric for Panorama back in 2013. At that time, no other NIPT reported on fetal fraction, but physicians really gravitated to our test because of that result, and the metric has now become the gold standard in a requirement for the field. These new oncology and transplant metrics provide a window into a patient's underlying biology, which can offer a physician crucial context when designing how to incorporate a test result into clinical decision-making. Our technology lends itself to these types of metrics, further differentiating the clinical utility of our products across all areas of our business. I'm pleased that Natera continues to be a leader in the industry in this area of innovation. We were also very pleased to secure another major competitive win by being selected by NRG Oncology for the U.S. arm of the CIRCULATE trial. You have seen the significance of the data sets coming out of CIRCULATE Japan, and we now think winning the critical U.S. arm puts us even further ahead in terms of developing prospective validation data for colorectal cancer. These 2 trials, together with the work we are doing with BGI in China, make up the largest commercial CRC MRD markets when you consider both the incidence and the reimbursement landscape. Although we aren't going to do a deep dive on our Signatera pharma trials today, we are now fully enrolling patients into both the Phase III IMvigor and ZEST trials we discussed on our last call, and our pharma pipeline continues to build. We are also now offering a broad plex product to our pharma partners in the RUO setting. As you're aware, Natera can multi-plex thousands of probes in a single reaction. So offering a broad plex test in the range of 50 or 100 or more targets is easy for us to do. We've only seen very targeted interest thus far in the broader plex offering. But for those who want it, we now have it available. We've been doing this kind of work upon request for a long time, but we've now made it available as part of our standard menu. In addition, Natera has developed a series of Signatera innovations that it intends to introduce in 2022 and 2023. As you know from our NIPT business, we're constantly innovating and pushing the limits of the technology. I'm also pleased to announce the progress of the clinical launch of Signatera in China with our partner BGI. Recently, BGI kicked off a multisite prospective trial in GI cancers, including colorectal cancer. The study plans to enroll roughly 500 patients and includes many of the top academic centers across China. BGI plans to expand on this initiative and is kicking off a series of investigator-initiated trials across other cancer types. Gaining support from top academic centers and KOLs is important for broader clinical launch, which requires the Chinese FDA approval and we expect will take several years to achieve. Finally, we're excited to announce the details of our road map in early cancer detection. We've signed a partnership with Aarhus University that gives us access to a prospective 40,000 sample biobank of patients screened for colorectal cancer. In addition, we've got an exclusive option to license Aarhus' IP, and we have access to their methylation signature, which is performing very well across all stages, which we plan to combine with our own methylation and ctDNA technology. As you can see, we've had a very busy quarter. I'll now jump into each of these, starting with the unit growth on the next set of slides. Our unit growth has really been accelerating recently, and I think this longer-term historical view gives us some context to the growth trajectory we've been on for the last 4 quarters. You could see that while we made steady, if lumpy, progress in prior years, the business has rocketed upward on a much steeper ramp since Q3 of last year. That is not a coincidence. In women's health, the new ACOG guidelines came out roughly 12 months ago, and we launched both our transplant and oncology products in the second half of last year. We don't think this is a 1-year trend. The NIPT market is still very underpenetrated compared to the 4 million to 5 million pregnancies in the U.S. So there's a long way to go, and of course, we are just getting started in both transplant and oncology, both of which we're starting to see play out as significant opportunities. On the next slide, you can see the volume growth is clearly translating to revenue growth as well. You can see once again the scale-up in growth we've experienced in the last year. This is driven by both the volume trends and also continued improvement in the realized revenues per test or ASP. We saw another nice increase in the blended ASPs in the business over Q2, which continues a multi-quarter trend going back to last year. We benefited from the volume mix shifting toward the newer, higher-priced products, and we also had some healthy appeals wins on older claims that came in through the quarter in women's health. Mike will spend more time on ASPs later in the call, but we still have plenty of room to run on ASPs across their various products. Okay, so we've got a fantastic set of milestones to now review in organ health. I want to start off by highlighting some broader trends that are occurring with our organ health products. First, we've expanded from a single organ product to now multiple organs with the launch of heart and lung. Our technology is robust, and we're seeing it translates well across the organs in a very cost-efficient way, which we think offers a great expansion opportunity for Natera. Second, whereas, at one point, we only had retrospective data, that's now no longer the case. We now have significant prospective multisite data. In some cases, we believe we now have the most significant prospective data in the space. Third, we focus on innovation to improve test performance. For example, with the launch of quantification and now we're seeing AUCs that are exceptional from just ctDNA alone. These trends, expanding other organs, producing high-quality, multisite prospective data sets and delivering exceptional AUC through innovation, all support a path for rapid growth in Prospera. In kidney, it's been a little more than a year since we were awarded our local coverage decision for Prospera, and we started our commercial launch in earnest, and we are very pleased with the level of commercial traction we're generating so far. Of the top 100 transplant centers, 45 have now implemented Prospera routinely into their practice. We've also been pleased with the enrollment in our registry trial, PROACTIVE, where we now have more than 2,500 patients enrolled. You may recall there was external skepticism about whether we would be able to successfully enroll patients into this trial, but clearly, we've done an exceptional job. This level of adoption among top centers just a little more than a year into the launch gives us confidence that our commercial plan is working. Now with the addition of new organs, very strong multisite prospective data and our innovative quantitative approach, we're in an even better position to build on the momentum we've seen thus far. Let me talk now for a minute about Prospera with quantification. Prospera is now the only commercially available cell-free DNA test for kidney rejection that provides 3 values: the quantity of the donor-derived cell-free DNA, the fraction of the donor-derived cell-free DNA and the total amount of cell-free DNA, on every report. Other available cell-free DNA tests only report on the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA alone, which has limitations, especially when the total cell-free DNA is high, which may result in false negatives. As you can see here on the left side of the slide, the percentage of the donor-derived cell-free DNA is a fraction that incorporates the absolute quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA as the numerator and the total amount of cell-free DNA as the denominator. The donor-derived cell-free DNA comes from the donated organ, and the total cell-free DNA mostly comes from the recipient. The fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA can change significantly if the denominator or the recipient cell-free DNA is artificially increased. When reporting donor-derived cell-free DNA fraction alone, like our competitors do, doctors need to be very careful about any factors that might impact the denominator. There are 10 items on the right hand of the slide that we've identified in the literature that can impact the total cell-free DNA. Our hypothesis was that incorporating a measurement of the absolute quantity of cell-free DNA rather than just a fractional loan into the result would improve the sensitivity of the assay, and that's exactly what we're now seeing in our studies. To test our hypothesis, we performed a validation study of the Prospera with quantification method with UCLA that resulted in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of American Nephrology, one of the premier journals. The paper showcased the improved performance from Prospera with quantification in 41 kidney transplant recipients, 9 of whom were experiencing rejection. Incorporating the quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA with the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA improve the sensitivity of the Prospera test from initially identifying 7 out of 9 cases of rejection to then 9 out of 9 cases of active rejection, which were then confirmed with biopsy. This improvement has now been seen across several different independent data sets, a number of which are in submission for publication. The most significant data set comes from the Trifecta study, which I'll go into on the next slide. Yesterday, we announced the results of the Trifecta study. The Trifecta study is a multisite prospective trial being led by Dr. Phil Halloran from the University of Alberta, a leading KOL in the field. The study, which included more than 300 biopsy match samples and greater than 100 biopsy match rejections, is the largest multisite prospective fully biopsy match study ever performed in the space. In the study, we tested the AUC of Prospera with quantification to distinguish rejection from nonrejection using BANFF 2019 criteria, and we showed an AUC of 0.81. We then used molecular pathology as the standard and showed an AUC of 0.89. There are recent studies that suggest that molecular pathology may be a better standard than BANFF, suggesting that Prospera may be performing better than previously suspected. Finally, we also compared rejection versus quiescence crescents or essentially, rejection versus exceptionally stable patients, resulting in AUC of 0.91. This last analysis, the comparison of rejection to quiescence is similar in concept to that used by some of our competitors in their recent multi-modality publications. Unfortunately, it isn't a very useful analysis clinically, which I'll touch on in a minute. Overall, the AUCs from the Trifecta study are exceptional. The definitive data is now in. Prospera with quantification performed very well, and Natera now has the largest fully biopsy match study that's ever been performed in the kidney transplant space. I want to take a second to quickly touch on rejection versus quiescence because it's easy to get confused on the different types of analyses that are out there. Rejection versus nonrejection is different from rejection versus quiescence. Quiescence includes essentially only the most stable of stable patients. As you can see below, this type of analysis excludes intermediate patients, which it really isn't practical in a real-world setting. In most cases, it's not possible to determine a patient is quiescent without doing a biopsy first to determine if there are any nonrejection pathological findings. That is why the vast majority of the papers in the field have assessed rejection versus nonrejection, which remains the main benchmark for performance. As you assess the landscape of testing available, keep in mind that the analysis being performed may be different than the intended use population, and just - and thus, the results may be less clinically useful. So far from what we've seen, multi-modality approaches have not been validated in rejection versus nonrejection cohorts, and their performance in that intended use population remains to be seen. On the next slide, I'm really pleased to provide details on the recent launch of Prospera in the heart transplant setting. As I said before, it's been relatively easy for us to expand beyond kidney to other organs because of our robust core technology. In addition, it's also proving to be commercially efficient because we're able to leverage a lot of the same infrastructure in terms of nurse coordinators and customer support. So it's also been cost-efficient for us to enter this space. We think Prospera Heart offers compelling advantages versus our competing tests. Our validation study is a multisite study that included greater than 250 prospective samples collected during 2020 and 2021 for the purpose of validating Prospera Heart and another 100 samples from a biopsy match biobank. You can see the results of the study on the right-hand side of the page. The initial results were impressive, but then further improved with quantification where we were able to achieve an area under the curve of 0.88. These are really exceptional AUCs in the heart transplant monitoring space, further underscoring the power of our technology. What's critical about these results is that the Prospera Heart test is delivering this exceptional AUC by performing cell-free DNA alone, and therefore, we believe there is no need for cumbersome and costly multi-modality approaches to bolster test performance. Competitor test in heart must be collected at a site that is set up for specialized handling because the sample must be immediately spun down and shipped on dry ice. Since our test is a simple blood test, patients can access our convenient mobile phlebotomy service, which can be important given the frequency of testing. In addition, the competitive test in heart charges Medicare twice for every multi-modality patient time point since separate DNA and RNA tests are being performed on each patient. Because we are delivering excellent performance on a cell-free DNA-based test alone, Prospera Heart reduces the cost of the system and is less than half the price of the expensive multi-modality approaches. We think this combination of test performance, convenience and cost represents a compelling offering for physicians and patients. We keep the product expansion opportunities rolling on the next page with our lung transplant launch. We are getting a lot of the same efficiencies with this launch, the same robust Prospera workflow and leveraging a lot of the same commercial infrastructure that we've built. The sales and commercial teams overlap with the heart team, so again, it's very efficient for us to go after this opportunity. We think the validation data and results in lung are very strong. The study was run by the lung transplant program at the Ohio State University, was presented at CHEST a few weeks ago and very well received. Prospective study examined 204 plasma samples obtained with concurrent bronchoscopy biopsy procedures from 104 lung transplant recipients between September of 2020 and June of 2021. Using the Prospera lung test, donor-derived cell-free DNA levels were compared across clinical histopathologic diagnostic cohorts. During the study, 35 episodes of acute rejection were analyzed. This study represents the largest trial of a commercially available donor-derived cell-free DNA test for lung transplant assessment. And once again, the AUC was incredibly strong, underscoring the power of our technology. For both the heart and lung products, we plan to submit dossiers for Medicare reimbursement under the existing local coverage decision, and we anticipate receiving coverage in 2022. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting opportunities. We've made a lot of progress in kidney. And we're now expanding to other organs. We've been hard at work in developing very strong data sets, and now we have, in some cases, the largest prospective data sets available. We're innovating. We're launching improvements such as Prospera with quantification. We're seeing exceptional AUCs. I think we're in an excellent position long term to compete very well in the organ health space. I'm going to hand it over to Solomon in a minute to walk through all the recent news on Signatera, but first, I want to spend a moment describing the effort we have underway in early cancer detection. Our strategy here is to pursue a capital-efficient development program that is not distracted from the work we are doing with Signatera, but instead leverages the technology we are already developing, along with the data we are generating with our growing base of clinical volumes in oncology. That last item is critical because we run an upfront exome on every Signatera sample. We're accumulating a data set of tens of thousands of early-stage cancer exomes that has never existed before. We can now interrogate that data set to assist in the design of a DNA-based signature that maximizes test performance. We've already completed the initial design of the colorectal cancer early screening DNA component. Now we're excited to validate and expand on that effort with our new partnership with Aarhus University. In the partnership, we've secured access to a biobank of 40,000 colorectal screening samples, prospectively collected and would match outcomes data. More than half of the affected samples are stage I or II cancers. We've also secured an exclusive option to license IP and access to a methylation signature from Aarhus, which demonstrated strong potential in a recently published study. The methylation signature alone reported an average sensitivity of 85% with a specificity of 99% across stage I through IV colorectal cancers. The performance was also very strong in early-stage cancers with an 80% sensitivity in stage I and 85% sensitivity in stage II cancers. We'll, of course, need to replicate these results, and we also believe we can improve upon the methylation signature by incorporating it into our own unique methylation workflow and adding in our DNA technology. We'll start off with the colorectal assay and then have the potential to add additional cancer types in the future. So while we continue to build on our lead with Signatera and MRD, we've got a targeted program running in this adjacent and very large market. I look forward to providing periodic updates on our progress here in the future. With that, let me now hand it over to Solomon to cover the other oncology updates. Solomon? Yes, thanks for the questions. So we're really excited about this partnership. I mean the methylation data that they published looks very strong. The biobank obviously is very significant, so we're very pleased to get access to this. We hope to generate some combined data on the performance of DNA and the sort of Version 2 of the methylation platform in 2022. But there's still a lot of work to do, so we're not putting out any time lines right now, but we do think we can generate some data during that time frame. That doesn't necessarily mean we'll complete the entire validation of the 40,000 sample cohort in that time frame, but just that we would make some additional data available on the combined performance of the assay. Frankly, we actually hope that we can use this cohort itself to go to the FDA. We plan on going and speaking with the FDA about the use of this cohort. We ultimately don't know what they're going to say, and we're not sort of hanging our hat on the fact that they're going to accept this as the final validation. So once we go through that process, we'll have more insight into whether we need to execute a prospective trial or not. But certainly, this cohort alone will provide, I think, very strong validation data that will give us significant confidence about making that decision to move forward and make the investment in a prospective cohort, if we do that. Yes. So the Prospera with quantification technique is obviously something that's unique to Natera. It's performing exceptionally well. We've designed this in a way that we really don't have to do any additional workflow. And so although I think we could go try to take price, we made the decision to just pass this through as a benefit to patients and to physicians without increasing the price in any way. But it's an exceptionally streamlined workflow where we've leveraged some novel microbiology and novel bioinformatics techniques to be able to provide this without really increasing our COGS. With regards to some of the challenges with the competitive landscape, we don't think that there's any blowback to Natera. I think we're in a very good position, and we look forward to competing hard. There's one last one there. Yes. So I think our plan includes the ability to extend into additional cancers, and I think we've enabled that opportunity through the partnership with Aarhus. As far as our internal methylation and DNA discovery work, we've built discovery platforms that aren't specific to colorectal that can extend into other cancer opportunities. So while our initial focus is on generating a proof of concept and then validation data for colorectal moving towards the commercial launch, longer term, our plan is to have a pan-cancer assay. But the initial work will be focused on colorectal. Yes. I mean our approach, thus far, is to take a very sort of cost-efficient approach and sort of have some phase gates as we move along here. And so far, we've leveraged the significant amount of information that we have coming from all the tumor exomes that we've run, and we use that to build a proprietary DNA-only aspect of the test. Now we're combining that with this methylation signature that we gained access to through the partnership with Aarhus and is performing very well, plus some internal discovery work and methylation workflow work that we're doing at Natera. So we plan on putting those 2 things together, generating some proof-of-concept data in early '22 and then running the 40,000 sample biobank thereafter. Our hope is that, that 40,000 biobank itself is enough for us to get approval from the FDA for the test. Now we don't know if that's the case. We haven't yet gone and spoken with the FDA when it's very likely that it won't, in fact, be sufficient to get approval, but that's what we hope. And if that turns out to be the case, that would be a massive win for us because we wouldn't then subsequently have to do the prospective study. I think we plan on having that conversation with the FDA sooner rather than later, so we can understand if we do have to do a prospective trial, we can start planning for that and start executing on that. Now in colorectal alone, we think that the trial - when you look around it, competitive trials are taken like in that kind of 3-year range. Now that's okay because we don't have to be the first test on the market. I think this is such a huge opportunity that it's not necessarily just about being the first on the market; it's about doing it right and having the right test, having the right customer experience, having the right performance. So if we see in the proof of concept and the subsequent validation data that we really have something here that we think is going to be a winner, we're not going to hesitate to pull the trigger on that prospective trial. As far as the much broader expansion to pan-cancer, we're going to have to get through some of these phase gates and hit some of these milestones before we can really talk about the time line for doing a prospective study of that size. Yes. Sure. So I'll make the comment and then maybe, Solomon, you could comment. So we have, I think, more than 50 different trials that are ongoing at any time or biobanks that are ongoing at any time, and various of those are going to be reading out over the next kind of quarter, the next 6 months, the next 12 months. So we've got a lot of data coming out, and that's really sort of broad across different cancer types. I'm not going to go through and sort of name each one, but there's additional data in GI. There's additional data in some of the cancer types like melanoma, for example, or other areas where we haven't had significant readouts that we're pretty excited about. So stay tuned for what's coming. I do think, in the near term, one of the most significant readouts, or has the potential to be one of the most significant readouts, is coming at the ASCO GI Conference in the beginning of 2022 where we expect there to be another very significant report on the CIRCULATE Japan study in the colorectal space. And I think that's going to be exciting, and I think that has the potential to be market changing Solomon, do you want to add any additional comments there? Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. Thanks, Catherine. So just first on the timing. I think we had initially understood that the final LCD had to publish publicly in September. However, we've now clarified that September was the deadline for MolDx to send the LCD to CMS National for approval. And we understand that that's taking place. We've had a lot of consistent and positive dialogue with the MolDx program, and their feedback is that the administrative process is just ongoing. And ultimately, it's their process, but everything we've heard makes us think that it's on track and it's going to be published soon. And so we'll have more updates on the time line as we get them. As far as submitting additional indications, you can basically go back and look at anywhere where we published a paper, a muscle invasive bladder cancer, neoadjuvant breast, lung, et cetera, anywhere where we published a paper, we think we're eligible to submit for reimbursement. And as Solomon said a moment ago, we have other papers in ovarian and so forth that are already submitted where we've - in some cases, we've gotten editor comments back already, and so we have a pipeline of papers coming out. And as a reminder, we've already submitted our tech assessment for stage IV colorectal cancer, which we think would fall under the CRC LCD, which is already in final stage. Yes. I think there's some different options there. I mean, look, we're - we still got a long way to go before we're actually pulling the trigger on commercialization. So ultimately, if we have a product that works well that's reimbursed, the commercialization part is easy, and that's something that we do exceptionally well. So I think we'll have to deal with that when the time comes. But our women's health channel, I think, is an exceptional channel for commercialization. We're now broadly covering the vast majority of women's health providers. And as you know, many women use their OB/GYN or GYN as a primary care provider. But yes, lots of opportunities for commercialization, and we'll cross that bridge in the future. Yes. Thanks, Max. So things are going well. I think, obviously, Signatera as a whole is going well. I mean I'm looking at our volume growth just in that clinical sector, and I think we're growing exceptionally well there. I think Altera generally has been ordered alongside Signatera. That's how we've been promoting it thus far. We really haven't been promoting it as a stand-alone indication. I think we might in the future, but Signatera is such an enormous market that I think we want to keep our energy focused there. And as we bring on additional products in this space, whether that be tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling or a liquid biopsy-based comprehensive genomic profile, we're going to do it in the context of supporting Signatera. Yes. Thanks. So I think, obviously, since the guideline came out about a year - a little over a year ago, we've seen an acceleration in the percentage of business that we're doing that's average risk versus high risk, and that's something that we tracked. We've also seen just an acceleration in volume overall. I think there's still some big opportunities where average risk is not fully rolled out yet, whether that's big MFM practices that are still sort of working through exactly how they're going to offer it and how they're going to roll it out to their community-based OB/GYN practices; or whether it's big hospital systems that are sort of working through exactly how they're going to integrate it routinely into practice; or whether it's state Medicaid programs that are figuring out how they're going to deal with coverage. So it's not sort of this overnight switch where everybody immediately starts doing the testing. But we still do firmly believe that, that sort of 90%-plus market penetration will be hit in this sort of 3-year time frame. And that matches, I think, to the prior testing methodologies on the market. I think that we're kind of tapping out maybe low 80s, but given some of the performance improvements in NIPT, I do think you'll get to that kind of 90% penetration range. We think, overall, high-risk testing is probably in the high 70s, low 80s. An average risk testing is probably in the kind of high 20s, maybe low 30s at this point. And we think Natera's market share now is close to 40% or something in that range. We track our market share, and we can see the competitive market shares as well through these detailed market surveys that we do. And we've been gaining share relative to the rest of the market, and we hope that trend continues. Yes. Well, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of stuff going on, continuing to execute well across the business, a lot of exciting momentum in transplant as we announced today. A lot of exciting momentum on Signatera, very, very long way to go in NIPT. So there's a lot of excitement. Mike, do you want to comment specifically on sort of how we're thinking about forecasting or what we're thinking about for '22? Yes. Maybe I'll comment on the transplant stuff, and then, Mike, you could comment on the rest. I think when you look at - I think we showed a slide today that about 45 of the top 100 transplant centers are using Prospera regularly. I think that probably including some centers that are splitting with CareDx, but that certainly includes some where we displaced CareDx, and they're using a very significant amount of testing. I think, look, the - we've always seen a diagnostic. Some doctors want to use 2 different providers, or maybe different doctors within a center want to use 2 different providers, and that's fine because the overall market is still about kind of 8%, 9%, 10% penetrated. And there's just a very long way to go here in kidney. And now we're talking about going into heart. We've launched to go into lung, and there's other organs that we think are going to be important in the future as well. So it's a long way to go. As far as registry trials and so forth, I think that that's not accurate. It's just simply not true. There's a very small portion of the business that we're doing that's part of a registry trial, and the remainder is commercial testing. Yes. So I think the first thing is, the public health sector there, I think, does an exceptional job of collecting these extensive outcomes data, and that's what gives you the opportunity to piggyback on something as exceptional as a well-curated 40,000 sample biobank. Part of the reason why we partner with them is because they have this exceptional biobank, they have great researchers, and they this methylation signature that is delivering just exceptional performance. If you look at, I think, across the different stages, 85% sensitivity with a 99% specificity, that by itself actually is exceptional. We're augmenting that to include our own methylation targets and DNA signature that we've mined from tens of thousands of colorectal exomes. So the partnership made sense based on what they brought to the table, what we brought to the table, and again, it's a cost-efficient way for us to go after this. As far as the population goes, I mean, look, that's one of the things we've got to have discussions about when we go for a pre-submission meeting with the FDA, among other things. And as I said before, look, this probably or may not end up being the end-all, be-all set that we need to get the test reimbursed. We hope it will be, and we think we have a good case when we go make the pre-submission meeting. But ultimately, we might end up having to do a prospective trial. Now, if the test performs as we expect it to and we continue to believe the market opportunity is as big as we think and others think it is, we will not hesitate to pull the trigger and run that trial, even if we're not going to be the first to market, which we don't think matters. If you look at NIPT, we were the fourth to market multiple years after others, and now we have 40% share. So you want to have the best test, you want to have the best distribution, the best customer experience, and you don't have to be first to market to deliver that."

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let's get into the recent highlights. As we covered in our pre-announce, we had another phenomenal growth quarter. Q2 was the fastest year-on-year growth for both volumes and revenues we've had as a public company. And that's on a volume base that is now more than four times larger than when we went public. I'm pleased to announce that we've exceeded the top end of our pre-announcement ranges in unit\u2019s processed, total revenue and product revenue. We processed 376,000 tests in Q2, which was approximately 61% growth over the same period last year. Total revenues and product revenues were both up 64% and approximately 71%, respectively over the same period last year. That acceleration is being driven by continued strong growth in the Women's Health business and big contributions from oncology and transplant. Those businesses are now large enough to contribute meaningfully and really shift our growth rates upward. Given all this momentum, we are excited to be raising the revenue guide for a second time this year. We started at $500 million to $525 million then upped that range to $550 million to $575 million in May. We are now raising our guidance once again to $600 million to $620 million in revenues for this year, up almost $100 million versus where we started in March. As we are having success with our new product launches we are also needing to accelerate investments we had planned to make over the next two years, which we are very happy to do. Mike will cover the full guide later in the call. We were also very excited to see the Women's Health business got to cash flow breakeven in the quarter. This was one of the top goals I announced when I took over as CEO in 2019 and I'm proud that our team achieved this while simultaneously hitting record growth rates. In oncology, we've continued to generate high-quality evidence. We now have 14 peer-reviewed publications with many more on the way. We're also excited to see the quality of evidence is progressing, shifting away from validation studies and focusing on outcomes data like overall survival for example. We recently had four newly published or presented prospective trials where outcomes data is available including three trials that measured overall survival and one that showed Signatera is predictive of treatment response. We believe these prospective trials with outcomes data is a significant step towards full adoption of MRD testing by physicians and professional societies. These studies have taken years to reach this stage and we think this clearly differentiates Signatera in the market and lays the groundwork for broad reimbursement and adoption. We were also very pleased to announce another high quality study yesterday that we think has the potential to unlock a new and large indication in breast cancer. The first patient has now been screened in a prospective multisite definitive ZEST trial, a new Phase III study with GSK that will evaluate the efficacy of niraparib in 800 breast cancer patients that are being monitored with Signatera after adjuvant treatment. Signatera received a Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA for this study and I'll go over the details of this trial later in the presentation. We've also made several key commercial strides with Signatera in the quarter. Our direct sales channel team is performing very well and the launch is accelerating. We also launched with Foundation Medicine in the pharma sector and with BGI in China. Each of these partners enables us to impact patients in a way that we would not have been able to reach on our own. Foundation Medicine currently has a substantial number of pharma partnerships and we believe is the market leader in tissue clinical volumes every year. BGI is a leading diagnostics player in China and has a formidable commercial channel and reimbursement expertise in that country. Both of these commercial launches are in their early stages and will take some time to get going, but we think each can contribute to Natera's growth in the coming years. We also had a major win on the reimbursement front, when we were awarded ADLT status for Signatera which moves our recurrence monitoring Medicare reimbursements from $795 per test to $3,500 per test. And finally, as most of you know, we've completed a follow-on equity offering that brought in roughly a net $551 million. We launched with a $350 million offering. And we're able to substantially upsize the raise in the process, due to the strong response we received from investors. As we will describe, we think we have a lot of high-return projects to fund. And we look forward to putting the capital to work. I'll spend more time on all of these developments later in the call. Okay. Let's drill into the unit growth on the next slide. I think this longer-term historical view is great, because it gives a sense of what our experience with Q2 has been in the past. Q2 has historically been slightly down sequentially versus Q1, driven by the seasonality in the Women's Health business where Q1 is typically very strong and Q2 is a lot softer for our existing accounts. This year as you can see, in the Q2 bar on the far right something different is happening. First, the growth in our Women's Health business has accelerated to a level that it has now completely overcome the negative impact of seasonality, we traditionally see in Q2. We are benefiting from our SMART trial data that was read out in January, which set a new bar in quality and science for NIPT validation data. And we're benefiting from the joint ACOG and SMFM practice bulletin recommending NIPT, for all pregnant women. We think we're clearly in the early stages of expanding from roughly 1.5 million NIPTs in the United States, to what could be more than four million NIPTs overtime. Second, the growth rates are compounded by the fact that our product launches in transplant and oncology are exceeding our internal expectations on a scale that is requiring us to accelerate capacity build-out and hire across the operations teams. Signatera volume is growing nicely, as we add new accounts every month and initiate more new patients for CRC and IO monitoring. We look forward to highlighting a few case studies later in the call. On the next slide, you can see that the volume growth is clearly translating to revenue growth as well, particularly in product revenues. We saw a nice increase in the blended ASPs in the business over Q1, which continues a multi-quarter trend going back to last year. While Women's Health ASPs were up modestly over Q1, most of the sequential improvement was really driven by the volume mix, since the transplant and oncology products have higher prices. I think that's a good sign for the rest of the year. As Mike will describe later on in the call we still think there's room for NIPT, ASPs to improve in the second half, based on the broader reimbursement trends we are seeing, particularly as we make steady progress with state Medicaid plans. Some of you will recall, when I was first named CEO in January of 2019, I said the top goal for the company was to get the Women's Health business to cash flow breakeven. Since then, we've been very, disciplined in our investments in that business. We've grown the ASPs. And we've reduced the COGS, while continuing to rapidly grow our volumes. So despite all the upside, we still have ahead of us in Women's Health, we estimate that now we are sustainably cash flow breakeven in that part of the business. I think that's an important case study for the overall company. We have now shown that once we make the necessary investments to establish the product and commercial channel, we can deliver continued growth, while optimizing COGS and being efficient with R&D and the sales team. As the volume grows in the new businesses we continue to benefit from the cost synergies by tapping into the scale and expertise, across our broader company. In the future, we can also apply several of the same COGS and operational savings strategies to the new businesses as well. Okay. So now let me move to Organ Health. We are tracking above our internal expectations for Prospera. And we believe the transplant market is still in the early stages of overall adoption, with a lot of room for future growth. In addition to growing our volumes, we're continuing to generate new evidence. Last week, a new study from UCLA was published in transplantation reports. In the study, the investigators ran both, Prospera and a competitive test on 15 patients, six of whom ultimately experienced a rejection. Using the validated 1% cutoff, the Prospera test correctly identified five out of six rejections versus four out of six for the competitor. This data is similar to a previously reported head-to-head study, where the Prospera test detected more cases of rejection than a competing test, using the validated 1% cutoff. In addition to the recent head-to-head study, we were also pleased to see Prospera perform extremely well in a cohort of patients that received a Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant. They are often referred to as SPK patients. It's important to perform well in this cohort, because multi-organ kidney transplants make up 8% of all kidney transplants. And these patients experience a 15% rate of rejection in the first year post-transplant. On the right side of the slide, is the data that was presented at the ATC Conference in June. In a cohort of 39 simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant recipients plus solo pancreas transplant recipients, Prospera performed very well across all testing metrics delivering solid performance across the board. Testing SPK patients allows us to help a new sector of the population, that's important to our transplant physicians. In addition, this study is evidence that Prospera, could perform well in organ types beyond kidney transplant patients. For example, in this study, we performed well on solo pancreas transplant patients, in addition to the SPK patients. As we talked about in May, we think the pathway to reimbursement in a broader range of organ transplants was substantially opened up by the CMS local coverage decision that was published in the spring. This is very important for us, because it lays out efficient path to gain reimbursement in organs beyond kidney. As we showed above, we're now seeing early evidence that our test works well in other organs such as, pancreas transplant recipients. This LCD is expected to be active later this year and we're keeping our eye on what's happening here. All right. Let's transition to oncology. We've now published on Signatera in 14 peer-reviewed publications. The validation data supports initial adoption and reimbursement, as we've now demonstrated the analytical and clinical performance of the test across a broad range of cancer types. I mentioned the shift to prospective studies with outcomes data at the top of the call. This includes some very large prospective real-world interventional studies as well, like the CIRCULATE trial. The studies are critical differentiators, because they are larger, designed to change practice guidelines and they take years to mature. It's important to see the test performance hold up in the prospective real-world setting, where the focus shifts to verifiable patient outcomes, rather than analytical performance metrics. We started these more significant trials years ago and we're now starting to see that work come to fruition, as they read out. First, we were recently excited to present updated data at the ESMO GI Conference on the prospective real-world interventional CIRCULATE trial. There are now more than 2,000 patients enrolled in the study, with six months of follow-up available for the first 800 patients. We've maintained the high presurgical detection and longitudinal sensitivity and specificity to relapse from our validation studies in this prospective real-world setting and we finally got a substantive look at the initial outcomes data, based on MRD status. We are ecstatic to see that more than 99% of patients who are MRD-negative remain disease-free at the six-month median time point, regardless of whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy or not. This is a huge step forward and I'll explain why on the next slide. There's a key clinical utility question that needs to be answered in stage III colorectal patients. Can we avoid giving chemotherapy for MRD-negative patients? Today, in stage III colorectal cancer, nearly 100% of patients get adjuvant chemotherapy, but about 50% of patients don't need it, because they're cured by surgery alone. One of the biggest objections we get from doctors is that, they aren't ready to stop giving chemotherapy to stage III patients which would be against the NCCN guidelines. They agree, MRD testing today can be helpful in stage III colorectal to decide between three months versus six months of adjuvant chemotherapy, but what they really want is to confidently avoid giving chemotherapy to MRD-negative patients. The CIRCULATE trial was designed to test this hypothesis that MRD-negative patients could safely be deescalated from chemotherapy after surgery. On the left, you'll see a diagram of the patient flow in the CIRCULATE trial. In the bottom arm, each MRD-negative patient is randomized to receive standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy or not. We believe the study will ultimately show that there's no benefit to receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who are MRD-negative. The interim disease-free survival data strongly suggests that we are on track to validating that hypothesis, which could be a game-changer. This is a type of trial that can change guidelines and unlock one of the big clinical use cases that physicians are asking for, an indication where doctors simply won't use the test without this level of high-quality outcomes data. Since this trial was initiated three years ago, we believe this data will further differentiate us from further entrants in the market. We anticipate the results of the MRD-negative stratification will be presented for the first time at ASCO GI in January of 2022. If that reads out as we anticipated, that will be a defining moment for Signatera in colorectal cancer and we look forward to seeing the data. Deepening our data trove in colorectal cancer is one of our core strategies. And in addition to the new de-escalation indication described above, we also recently published a prospective trial in stage IV colorectal cancer that showed excellent performance, including overall survival results, unlocking another layer of colorectal utility beyond stage II and III. This paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Precision Oncology was an analysis from the prospective PREDATOR clinical trial, following 112 patients with stage IV disease, who underwent surgery with curative intent. At the first time point, 30 days post-surgery, from a single time point alone, we had sensitivity to relapse of 72%. This increased to 91% when we were able to test a second follow-up blood draw on those patients who did not receive adjuvant chemo. In addition, 96% of patients who were MRD-negative at the single time point after surgery were still alive at the end of clinical follow-up, which lasted up to 54 months. That compares to just 52% overall survival for patients that were Signatera positive. The overall survival rate increased to 100%, when including patients who remained MRD-negative in the longitudinal setting. This paper addresses an important unmet clinical need. Since guidelines are currently vague on which stage IV colorectal patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery with curative intent, it's currently recommended to monitor these patients closely for early signs of recurrence. On the basis of this publication, we have already submitted to Medicare to expand coverage under the current LCD to include stage IV oligometastatic patients, which we expect may come in late 2021 or early 2022. As a reminder, the opportunity here is sizable, as we estimate there are about 10,000 new diagnoses per year in stage IV oligometastatic colorectal cancer with the testing frequency similar to CEA, leading to a TAM of approximately 100,000 tests per year, which is sizable from historical standards. We're really proud of the studies we generated and we believe the shift to outcomes data, including prospective overall survival data, where we track patient outcomes for nearly five years and confirming one's validation data in a real-world interventional setting, is important to further penetrate the clinical market and get reimbursed at scale. We were also proud to see another prospective publication, with overall survival data this quarter in Nature, with the excellent results from the Phase III IMvigor010 muscle invasive bladder cancer trial that we did with Genentech. This trial was a major effort conducted over seven years to evaluate whether Genentech's immunotherapy drug atezolizumab could improve outcomes in the adjuvant muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Before reading out the data Genentech prespecified an endpoint to evaluate patient response -- patients who were Signatera-positive after surgery, in addition to the all-comers format originally designed. When the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint in all-comers, we reported a significant treatment benefit in Signatera MRD-positive patients that received atezolizumab and no treatment benefit in the MRD-negative patients. This study showed that Signatera is predictive of treatment benefit in this setting. This predictive claim is very difficult to make and it can only be achieved through a high-quality study such as this one. In addition to our predictive claim, we reported prospective data showing MRD-negative patients have a much better overall survival than MRD-positive patients. Based on the strength of these results, Genentech has already started enrolling patients in a sequel Phase III trial IMvigor011 that will randomize to atezolizumab versus placebo among only those patients who test Signatera positive after surgery. Demand is now growing quickly across pharma and academic consortia to incorporate Signatera as a companion diagnostic in their pivotal randomized trials. This week we announced our second major Phase III drug trial the ZEST trial. This is a randomized multicenter placebo-controlled study sponsored by GSK to evaluate their PARP inhibitor niraparib in 800 patients with early-stage either triple-negative breast cancer or HR-positive HER2-negative BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Patients who test positive after standard of care definitive treatment will be randomized to receive niraparib versus placebo. If this trial is successful, it could create a potentially life-saving new treatment option for patients who test MRD-positive in this setting. Positive study results would provide support for doctors to prescribe this treatment in their office broadly which would be incredibly powerful for overall clinical adoption of Signatera. Some indications like breast cancer are best approached through these types of pharma partnerships because the clinical utility in breast cancer recurrence monitoring depends on new treatments being administered at the time of molecular recurrence. And that's not something a laboratory can generally take on by itself. So we're glad to be winning these types of big treatment on molecular recurrence trials which will unlock future clinical indications for Signatera. This project was made possible by the strong validation data we previously published in breast cancer including both the paper in Clinical Cancer Research and the I-SPY 2 data published in Annals of Oncology. Okay. I'm staying on Medicare for another minute. As we mentioned at the top of the call, we had a major breakthrough this summer when Signatera was awarded an ADLT status. Before this when a patient completed their adjuvant treatment monitoring period and entered recurrence monitoring our pricing for Signatera had been set at $795 per time point. Now with the ADLT status the reimbursement rate is $3,500 per blood draw for Medicare patients and we think this could be relatively stable over time. Given the nature of the longitudinal monitoring, over time a higher and higher percentage of blood draws will fall into this category which bodes well for the overall gross margin in the long-term. ADLT status is designed to reward innovation and the relevant statute requires several criteria to be met. A test must be unique in the marketplace satisfying a clinical need that no other commercially available test can address and also must employ a methodology that's based on a unique empirically driven algorithm. Signatera met these stringent criteria and we believe it will be difficult for any other future MRD competitor to achieve this status adding to our first mover advantage. This also gives us an important lever when contracting with commercial plans in the future and it helps our pharma business since Natera is extending its commercial leadership in MRD, which makes us more attractive as a companion diagnostic partner. Finally, looking forward, we are eagerly awaiting the finalization of our draft LCD for immunotherapy monitoring, which we expect to come through sometime earlier this year. We've been pleased with the initial adoption in this setting further validating our belief that Signatera can help inform difficult treatment decisions for patients receiving immunotherapy where standard imaging tools can be uninformative. The final slide highlights some of the near and longer-term indications we are targeting with Signatera. In the past, we focused this side exclusively on the near-term indications on the left-hand side of the page. These are indications where we've already generated excellent data and the clinical utility and use cases are very clear and we have line of sight to reimbursement with CMS and commercial launches in the near-term. Those near-term indications stack up about -- to about four million tests per year which is incredible from historical standards. This is roughly 10 times larger than the 400,000 tests per year in the traditional therapy selection market for example. However, despite this TAM being incredibly large from historical standards this is just the beginning. With several pivotal randomized trials now underway in colorectal, bladder, breast and others sponsored by pharma and leading academic consortia and with a strong pipeline of additional trials that may launch in the next 12 months to 18 months it's clear that some very large opportunities are beginning to stack up in both the US and globally including in Japan. We're simply looking at what we signed so far or have in front of us. We have a path to coverage of up to an additional nine million tests per year. This is exciting because although we're having significant growth now and we have an excellent runway to success in the near-term I could easily make the case that Signatera is really only scratching the surface and just at the beginning. And we could really hit full stride in the middle of this decade and beyond as these very large pivotal trials read out. So there's a lot of upside in the future. Finally, not on the slide, but important to our mission we were proud this quarter as two patient case studies were reported out in the national media from different providers in different parts of the country. One colorectal case was reported on NPR's Here & Now broadcast and one breast cancer case reported on ABC's Good Morning America. We want to thank those patients Bonnie and Mariel and their physicians for sharing how Signatera made an impact in their journeys. Okay. Now let me hand it over to Mike to discuss the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Steve. The next slide here is just a summary of the financial results for the quarter. Steve covered a lot of the trends on volumes and revenues. I'll just note again the acceleration we saw on the top-line. Our year-on-year volume growth rate was 48% in Q1 and now 61% in Q2. Product revenue year-on-year growth was 36% in Q1 and now 71% in Q2. ASP stepped up in the quarter. And as Steve mentioned more of that increase was really driven by volume mix as the new higher-priced products start to have more of an impact on our blended average selling price. Women's Health ASPs were also slightly higher in the quarter. And as Steve mentioned, I think we still have room to run over the next several quarters there. We got a substantial boost from improved reimbursement in our commercial insurance volumes if you compare where we are now on ASPs versus this time last year in the Women's Health business. And we've had some positive contracting decisions that we think can benefit the reimbursement for example in our managed Medicaid volumes over the next few quarters in Women's Health. I think it's important to note that we think there is significant upside in the current oncology ASPs which can improve over time just as the product launch matures. While the majority of our volume is in the colorectal cancer indication, we have seen many community oncologists really adopt Signatera for a broader range of cancer types. We are happy to see that because we think the data supports broad use. And we think we have clear line of sight to reimbursement in additional cancer types via the umbrella local coverage decision from CMS. As we've discussed in the past, we anticipate getting coverage for immunotherapy response monitoring this fall when that umbrella local coverage decision goes live. Then we think coverage in additional cancer types can come from a more streamlined process of just submitting the data. But for now, we're taking a lot of zeros at the moment as the launch progresses. We also haven't yet gotten the benefit from the ADLT designation which at least for our Medicare reimbursed volumes should be a lift in the second half. The story on the cost of goods sold per unit is really very similar. The COGS for the Women's Health business are looking very good. For example, NIPT now is in the $160 range per unit and we see a path to NIPT COGS below $125 per unit over time. In oncology, we are just at the start of the road map to drive COGS improvements. The first step is just to build out more capacity. We significantly brought forward investments to build out lab space to accommodate both the clinical demand and also specialized capacity designed to meet the needs of the larger Phase III trials, we are now running for pharma. None of the scale-up work carries significant technical risk and the volume trajectory we are on makes the return on capital math very clear. It does however require significant near-term CapEx and hiring in both the R&D and lab operations areas of the business. So, the gross margins in the quarter really reflects good traction in Women's Health and we will weigh down just a few points by the rapid growth phase we are in for Signatera. As we've discussed in the past, Signatera can of course be a higher-margin product than NIPT. So I view this very much as a temporary circumstance. The R&D and SG&A lines also reflect a significant upfront investment we are making in oncology. In research and development, we are adding staff to execute on scaling the lab along with the fulsome slate of clinical trial work we are doing with academic and pharma partners. We've talked a lot about the pharma partners today, but our recent publications have also generated a large volume of requests to support studies with KOLs in the field. This is the type of work that generates obvious long-term benefits even if it does not return cash immediately and we are staffing up to make sure we meet that demand. Crucially, we are also finding more products and services that can be wrapped around Signatera much like carrier screening is in the Women's Health business and what we are seeing so far from the Altera tissue CGP. While we occasionally evaluate small acquisition targets our history has been to avoid lots of M&A and invest more heavily in our own R&D efforts. That obviously leads to a bigger R&D line but we have found that approach to be much more effective and capital efficient in the past. One other line to note on this slide is the balance sheet. Steve referenced the equity offering in which we raised roughly $550 million in an upsized deal. We raised that capital for one key reason. We have a lead in this very large recurrence monitoring market and we are going to make all the necessary investments in the near term to set us up for long-term success. Okay. So, I think that gives you some background for the guide on the next page. We are significantly stepping up both our revenues and the investments for the balance of the year. As Steve mentioned, we are now guiding revenues about $100 million higher than when we started just a few months ago in March. The main driver here is the volume growth that has continually exceeded our expectations even through this summer. We've remained cautious on the ASPs in the guide. We don't assume a big step up in any of our products aside from some modest improvement in Signatera driven by the ADLT and the umbrella local coverage decision. So, for the revenues we are assuming continued volume growth across the business. In the new products, we are optimistic that our recent launch trajectory can continue in the near term. In Women's Health, we are seeing the continued momentum that Steve described. One note on the revenue map for the guide. It's important to recall that we took a onetime revenue recognition a positive bump of $28.6 million in Q1 this year related to QIAGEN. So, if you're making the comparison between first half and second half revenues on the guide, I think it's worth stripping that out. The result is you'll see the guide implies significant revenue growth in the second half of this year. On the gross margin guide we bumped that up on our last call in May and we're going to leave that stable for now, given the additional expenses associated with the lab expansion that will run through cost of goods sold and the potential for additional volume growth in indications that are not reimbursed yet. To balance that out there are some tailwinds associated with other COGS projects in the second half and both the ADLT designation and expected reimbursement for IO monitoring will help margins as well in the second half. The SG&A, R&D and resulting cash burn line reflect the additional work we have planned to get done this year which is almost exclusively focused on the oncology drivers I described more lab capacity, accelerated clinical trials in large indications, accelerating projects designed to reduce cost of goods sold per unit and exciting new products to pair with Signatera. The last line on the slide is the cash flow breakeven goal of women's health. Steve talked about how we've been able to get scale in women's health. And I think that's an important case study to visualize how we can get leverage on the oncology investments. As we expand into pan-cancer, we can leverage the same operating expenses we've built out for the colorectal cancer launch. So with indication expansion, increasing volumes, reduced COGS, and broader reimbursement, we are following much the same playbook to get to cash flow breakeven that we followed in women's health, but on a much larger scale. So it's an exciting time for Natera, and we are very excited to have been able to share these results with you. Operator? \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening and congrats on a nice quarter here again. Just one question here on Signatera, Steve. On the ADLT code upside, you're expecting a nice bump here on your Medicare volumes. But at some point I believe next year at the end of the first quarter that trend will normalize under the PAMA process yet you've got offsets to that. So can you just walk us through the longer-term ASP trend dynamics here? And also how getting that ADLT code can help with the competitive moat within MRD for you? \nSteve Chapman: Yes sure. That would be great. So the ADLT is a very significant advantage and it's only available to the first mover who has an innovative test on the market. So we're very glad that we were accepted into the program, and we were able to increase that recurrence monitoring price from $795 now up to $3,500 because over time as the flywheel effect of getting patients into recurrent ordering program occurs, you're going to have more and more and more of the patients at that recurrence monitoring time point. So it's critical that you maintain a high ASP in that time point. Now the way the program works is there's a time period. I believe it's roughly nine months where they look at your commercial claims. During that time period, you get paid the list price of $3,500. And then after that they look at your commercial claims and they'll reset your price based on the median weighted reimbursement from commercial parties. Now the good news is that we've been very strict about how we negotiate with private payers and we've successfully negotiated rates that are at or above this $3,500 price point with private payers. So we don't expect to see any price reductions on an ongoing basis through the PAMA process. Of course, it has to pay out -- play out over time, but at this stage all the rates we've negotiated are at $3,500 or higher and we expect to maintain the price point or have an increase.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. First question on the back of the financing and congrats on getting that done. Can you just talk a little bit more about the MRD road map for multi-cancer? You talked about four million tests in the near term 9 million longer-term? But maybe just talk a little bit about use of proceeds and how quickly you think you can scale up some of these efforts. \nSteve Chapman: Yes. So there's a lot of work, I think to roll out each of the different indications. The good news is that the most important thing to being successful in the Signatera market is generating the right data. And we started that process of generating the data a long time ago five years ago roughly. You look at some of these trials, they were ongoing for that period of time. We had teams of people out hunting for clinical trials that we could get into five years ago. So now the studies are reading out and they're being published. That's the most important thing in order to unlock usage in a particular tumor type and to unlock reimbursement in a particular tumor type. So when we look at where we are in colorectal today stage II and III we're seeing a lot of volume come in. We're seeing a rapid increase in ordering on the clinical side, which is great and in line with our expectations. We've now generated this data in oligometastatic stage IV colorectal deepening our penetration in the colorectal space and that data looked excellent. I mean, really good data with overall survival as well, which is really the next step down in kind of raising the bar for what type of data is required to move the needle. I think we're going to continue to penetrate colorectal. We're on market with an immunotherapy monitoring product, which is going very well. We're seeing increases consistently in the usage there. We've also shown muscle-invasive bladder, lung, neoadjuvant breast, ovarian, multiple myeloma. Now we just had a publication in esophageal cancer. So all those areas where we generated data and we have published data, I think over time we'll be rolling out those indications. We're actually seeing usage today in a lot of those indications even though our sales team is not promoting. We're just getting inbound requests where doctors read the paper and then they want the test or patients hear about it and they want the test. So we are seeing usage although the vast majority of our business, today is colorectal and immunotherapy. So, that's sort of one sector that the near term kind of 4 million tests per year opportunity. Then there's the bigger sector that's unlocked through these partnerships by pharma -- with pharma. And we think that's like breast treatment on molecular recurrence for example; lung treatment on molecular recurrence. And these big Phase 3 clinical trials take time to read out, but when they do read out, they're going to be massive market-moving guideline changing trials. So, it's kind of a great setup where we have this significant amount of growth and work that we can do in the near term. And then when we get to the kind of mid to upper-2020s, we have the second wave of extreme growth that's unlocked by the investments that we're making today in the trials. So that's sort of how we see it playing out. And the other thing that I think is good about these big trials like, for example, the breast one that we just announced, once the competitive landscape is established here and there's maybe a handful of folks that are participating in these trials. It's going to be really hard for others to come behind. I mean these are seven-year -- five to seven-year prospective clinical trials. These are the type of things that really truly build a competitive moat that make it very difficult for others to come in behind. So we feel like we're in a good position in the short-term and to tap into that very significant upside that's going to come in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess first just on the guide, you mentioned being cautious on ASP outlook and not baking in a significant increase in NIPT. I guess in theory shouldn't we see this bump up as some of the plans that updated their policies last year moved to accrual accounting? And when do you expect that that might happen in a more meaningful way?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, we -- yes, yes I was going to say -- Mike why don't you take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. No. Thanks Catherine for the question. Yes. So, we have seen some of that benefit. You kind of -- if I look back to kind of NIPT ASPs prior to any of those coverage decisions last year versus now, we have gotten a good step-up on the NIPT contracts in terms of the fraction of times we've gotten paid. I think that's true primarily in our commercial business although it's starting to look more and more, true through the Medicaid volumes as well. I do think that there is still room to go on the NIPT front in particular. Just as I look at the fraction of claims that are still unpaid for some reason like a prior authorization policy that we think can get removed or myriad other rationales that payers may have state Medicaid plans that aren't yet adherent to the new ACOG practice guideline for example. So, I think there's room for that the NIPT ASP to improve. I think there will be some benefit just by debt of the accrual as you mentioned. Just as you get more history with more and more payers, there is a kind of a natural momentum to that. So there is some modest ASP improvement in the guide there. A lot of that though in terms of kind of impact to ASPs on a blended company basis just comes from the fact that hey, we didn't have the ADLT really in a meaningful way in Q2 and we'll have it in Q3 and beyond. And to the extent we've got Medicare volume in Signatera colorectal cancer stages 2 and 3 then we'll get a bump from that. And the other piece is that on the Signatera ASP that there's kind of a natural progression where now that we have this ADLT the ASP -- the blend of ASPs that product can improve as you get more and more patients into the kind of the longer tail of recurrence monitoring tests versus kind of the upfront test as well. So that's a trend that can start to benefit us in the second half. All this requires a certain amount of forecasting. And as most of you know who followed the company for a while, we're just trying to be on the side of caution when it relates to the guide and in particular forecasting ASP. So, somewhat more of a philosophical point than anything else.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with BTIG. Your line is open.\nMark Massaro: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the quarter, the raise and all the data that you've been publishing. I guess a couple of weeks ago when you guys did the deal the financing, you indicated that you expected to make some significant announcements in the organ transplant business and potentially beyond, which I believe might be screening. Today you talked about simultaneous pancreatic-kidney transplant. So, I guess I'm just curious, if you could elaborate on any potential plans for expansion beyond kidney testing, would that obviously include pancreatic and some of the others? And then, any thoughts you have on early cancer detection? Just the development work you've been doing and I think previously you talked about plans to do colorectal cancer screening.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks Mark. Yes. So on the organ health side things are going really well. I think we're beating our plan, as we said, ahead of our expectations. We're starting to see some good data come out. We show this head-to-head study, which I think is now the second head-to-head study that's been performed where we've outperformed on the detection of rejection using the validated 1% cutoff. We showed now I think that our platform test works well in other organs. So the simultaneous pancreas-kidney pancreas alone transplants which is good. I think that essentially shows that we're going to be able to transport into other organs. And now that this LCD has been put in place, which is essentially an umbrella LCD that will allow us to go get reimbursed, if we choose to go into other areas. So I think the groundwork is all there. The sort of proof of concept is there. And I think we'll be in a good position to sort of make those moves in the future if that's an area that we decide to go into. I think when we look sort of across business, we have to kind of decide where we want to make the investments and so forth. But, certainly the kind of framework is in place there. On the early cancer detection side, we've basically said that we've developed a platform. We have some data that looks good. We have access to a significant number of samples and we're going to package all that up and describe it to everybody in the future when we're ready to. We just haven't done that yet. And so I think, that announcements will be coming where we're going to describe, what we're doing, what we have so far, and what our plans are. But we're just not rolling that out today. But we feel very good about the opportunity we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. This is Lou on for Dan. Just a quick questions on the organ, and then also oncology part. I think in the prepared remarks, you were talking about there is like -- you started to see contribution from those two business. Can you quantify, a little bit in terms of the volume or the type of revenue? And then also on the Women's Health I think you also mentioned the share gain. Can you also like talk a little bit more about the share gain opportunity, especially after one of your competitor exited the market? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yeah, sure. So why don't I talk about the share gain, and then maybe Mike you can talk about like, how we're managing breaking stuff out. So, on the Women's Health side, we have been just crushing it. I mean, we're accelerating. You can see the growth over the last couple of years, and sort of what we're doing now. I mean, it's a whole definite level of growth. So we're in a fantastic position. We've got a great technology. We've made significant improvements to the technology that have been launched this year with Pano AI that's playing out very, very well in the field. Great customer feedback. We've now got the largest prospective trial that's ever been done in the field of NIPT, where the results in a real-world setting held up and actually were better than our validation data. So that's super strong. I think some of the big academic centers and maternal-fetal medicine practices that hadn't been using us before considering a switch are now looking at the data. And they're excited about it, because this type \u2013 this quality of data just hasn't been produced before. So yeah, we are having competitive wins, but we're also seeing the market penetrate. And so those two things simultaneously happening are causing an acceleration in the Women's Health growth. The market today, we believe is about 30% -- maybe 35% overall penetrated. So there's a long way to go just simply riding the wave of penetration in the market. And even, if we weren't seeing competitive wins our business would grow just simply from penetrating that market. We think in the next three years that NIPT market is going to get to 90% growth \u2013 or excuse me, 90% penetration. So that's a very significant growth. But on the competitive side, we're outpacing everyone else from a growth standpoint. We're taking business from competitors. You saw one main competitor exit the market and they were a very strong competitor for a long time. When they announced our sales team went to work and we've done exceptionally well. I think converting that business to Natera. Based on the numbers we're seeing, we believe we got more than our share of that business. So we're feeling very good about that. I think we're in a good position. So Mike, do you want to maybe comment just on how we're breaking out organ health or oncology from a unit and revenue standpoint?\nMichael Brophy: Yeah. So our current plan has been just to describe the business on a total company basis now. That's largely for competitive reasons as it relates to the new product launches. We've had the experience in the past of giving very, very granular disclosure, which is easier for us and easier for you all, I appreciate, but we've seen it time and again actually harm the opportunity as competitors are able to kind of dial in for exactly how well we're doing and then redouble their efforts. So we're not inclined to give that at the moment. I think the other piece is that, we're still relatively early in these launches. I mean, we're a little over a year and little over six months in Oregon Health and Signatera respectively. And so we're still getting a handle on exactly what does the launch trajectory what does the growth curve look like in these businesses ourselves. And so I mean, over the relative near term, I think we'll be in a position to give more color there. I think on a total company basis, so you can kind of \u2013 you start to see some of the impact. I mean, a lot of the beat \u2013 well, all of the businesses are growing kind of ahead of our internal expectations. You don't raise guide from \u2013 $100 million from $500 to $525 million to over $600 million for total revenues without some new products really launching above your expectations. And so I think, you can see that in the guide and also just as a product revenue growth year-on-year. So clearly, it's having an impact on the business and stay tuned.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate it. Take care. \nMichael Brophy: Thanks everyone. Cheers.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let's get into the recent highlights. As we covered in our pre-announce, we had another phenomenal growth quarter. Q2 was the fastest year-on-year growth for both volumes and revenues we've had as a public company. And that's on a volume base that is now more than four times larger than when we went public. I'm pleased to announce that we've exceeded the top end of our pre-announcement ranges in unit's processed, total revenue and product revenue. We processed 376,000 tests in Q2, which was approximately 61% growth over the same period last year. Total revenues and product revenues were both up 64% and approximately 71%, respectively over the same period last year. That acceleration is being driven by continued strong growth in the Women's Health business and big contributions from oncology and transplant. Those businesses are now large enough to contribute meaningfully and really shift our growth rates upward. Given all this momentum, we are excited to be raising the revenue guide for a second time this year. We started at $500 million to $525 million then upped that range to $550 million to $575 million in May. We are now raising our guidance once again to $600 million to $620 million in revenues for this year, up almost $100 million versus where we started in March. As we are having success with our new product launches we are also needing to accelerate investments we had planned to make over the next two years, which we are very happy to do. Mike will cover the full guide later in the call. We were also very excited to see the Women's Health business got to cash flow breakeven in the quarter. This was one of the top goals I announced when I took over as CEO in 2019 and I'm proud that our team achieved this while simultaneously hitting record growth rates. In oncology, we've continued to generate high-quality evidence. We now have 14 peer-reviewed publications with many more on the way. We're also excited to see the quality of evidence is progressing, shifting away from validation studies and focusing on outcomes data like overall survival for example. We recently had four newly published or presented prospective trials where outcomes data is available including three trials that measured overall survival and one that showed Signatera is predictive of treatment response. We believe these prospective trials with outcomes data is a significant step towards full adoption of MRD testing by physicians and professional societies. These studies have taken years to reach this stage and we think this clearly differentiates Signatera in the market and lays the groundwork for broad reimbursement and adoption. We were also very pleased to announce another high quality study yesterday that we think has the potential to unlock a new and large indication in breast cancer. The first patient has now been screened in a prospective multisite definitive ZEST trial, a new Phase III study with GSK that will evaluate the efficacy of niraparib in 800 breast cancer patients that are being monitored with Signatera after adjuvant treatment. Signatera received a Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA for this study and I'll go over the details of this trial later in the presentation. We've also made several key commercial strides with Signatera in the quarter. Our direct sales channel team is performing very well and the launch is accelerating. We also launched with Foundation Medicine in the pharma sector and with BGI in China. Each of these partners enables us to impact patients in a way that we would not have been able to reach on our own. Foundation Medicine currently has a substantial number of pharma partnerships and we believe is the market leader in tissue clinical volumes every year. BGI is a leading diagnostics player in China and has a formidable commercial channel and reimbursement expertise in that country. Both of these commercial launches are in their early stages and will take some time to get going, but we think each can contribute to Natera's growth in the coming years. We also had a major win on the reimbursement front, when we were awarded ADLT status for Signatera which moves our recurrence monitoring Medicare reimbursements from $795 per test to $3,500 per test. And finally, as most of you know, we've completed a follow-on equity offering that brought in roughly a net $551 million. We launched with a $350 million offering. And we're able to substantially upsize the raise in the process, due to the strong response we received from investors. As we will describe, we think we have a lot of high-return projects to fund. And we look forward to putting the capital to work. I'll spend more time on all of these developments later in the call. Okay. Let's drill into the unit growth on the next slide. I think this longer-term historical view is great, because it gives a sense of what our experience with Q2 has been in the past. Q2 has historically been slightly down sequentially versus Q1, driven by the seasonality in the Women's Health business where Q1 is typically very strong and Q2 is a lot softer for our existing accounts. This year as you can see, in the Q2 bar on the far right something different is happening. First, the growth in our Women's Health business has accelerated to a level that it has now completely overcome the negative impact of seasonality, we traditionally see in Q2. We are benefiting from our SMART trial data that was read out in January, which set a new bar in quality and science for NIPT validation data. And we're benefiting from the joint ACOG and SMFM practice bulletin recommending NIPT, for all pregnant women. We think we're clearly in the early stages of expanding from roughly 1.5 million NIPTs in the United States, to what could be more than four million NIPTs overtime. Second, the growth rates are compounded by the fact that our product launches in transplant and oncology are exceeding our internal expectations on a scale that is requiring us to accelerate capacity build-out and hire across the operations teams. Signatera volume is growing nicely, as we add new accounts every month and initiate more new patients for CRC and IO monitoring. We look forward to highlighting a few case studies later in the call. On the next slide, you can see that the volume growth is clearly translating to revenue growth as well, particularly in product revenues. We saw a nice increase in the blended ASPs in the business over Q1, which continues a multi-quarter trend going back to last year. While Women's Health ASPs were up modestly over Q1, most of the sequential improvement was really driven by the volume mix, since the transplant and oncology products have higher prices. I think that's a good sign for the rest of the year. As Mike will describe later on in the call we still think there's room for NIPT, ASPs to improve in the second half, based on the broader reimbursement trends we are seeing, particularly as we make steady progress with state Medicaid plans. Some of you will recall, when I was first named CEO in January of 2019, I said the top goal for the company was to get the Women's Health business to cash flow breakeven. Since then, we've been very, disciplined in our investments in that business. We've grown the ASPs. And we've reduced the COGS, while continuing to rapidly grow our volumes. So despite all the upside, we still have ahead of us in Women's Health, we estimate that now we are sustainably cash flow breakeven in that part of the business. I think that's an important case study for the overall company. We have now shown that once we make the necessary investments to establish the product and commercial channel, we can deliver continued growth, while optimizing COGS and being efficient with R&D and the sales team. As the volume grows in the new businesses we continue to benefit from the cost synergies by tapping into the scale and expertise, across our broader company. In the future, we can also apply several of the same COGS and operational savings strategies to the new businesses as well. Okay. So now let me move to Organ Health. We are tracking above our internal expectations for Prospera. And we believe the transplant market is still in the early stages of overall adoption, with a lot of room for future growth. In addition to growing our volumes, we're continuing to generate new evidence. Last week, a new study from UCLA was published in transplantation reports. In the study, the investigators ran both, Prospera and a competitive test on 15 patients, six of whom ultimately experienced a rejection. Using the validated 1% cutoff, the Prospera test correctly identified five out of six rejections versus four out of six for the competitor. This data is similar to a previously reported head-to-head study, where the Prospera test detected more cases of rejection than a competing test, using the validated 1% cutoff. In addition to the recent head-to-head study, we were also pleased to see Prospera perform extremely well in a cohort of patients that received a Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant. They are often referred to as SPK patients. It's important to perform well in this cohort, because multi-organ kidney transplants make up 8% of all kidney transplants. And these patients experience a 15% rate of rejection in the first year post-transplant. On the right side of the slide, is the data that was presented at the ATC Conference in June. In a cohort of 39 simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant recipients plus solo pancreas transplant recipients, Prospera performed very well across all testing metrics delivering solid performance across the board. Testing SPK patients allows us to help a new sector of the population, that's important to our transplant physicians. In addition, this study is evidence that Prospera, could perform well in organ types beyond kidney transplant patients. For example, in this study, we performed well on solo pancreas transplant patients, in addition to the SPK patients. As we talked about in May, we think the pathway to reimbursement in a broader range of organ transplants was substantially opened up by the CMS local coverage decision that was published in the spring. This is very important for us, because it lays out efficient path to gain reimbursement in organs beyond kidney. As we showed above, we're now seeing early evidence that our test works well in other organs such as, pancreas transplant recipients. This LCD is expected to be active later this year and we're keeping our eye on what's happening here. All right. Let's transition to oncology. We've now published on Signatera in 14 peer-reviewed publications. The validation data supports initial adoption and reimbursement, as we've now demonstrated the analytical and clinical performance of the test across a broad range of cancer types. I mentioned the shift to prospective studies with outcomes data at the top of the call. This includes some very large prospective real-world interventional studies as well, like the CIRCULATE trial. The studies are critical differentiators, because they are larger, designed to change practice guidelines and they take years to mature. It's important to see the test performance hold up in the prospective real-world setting, where the focus shifts to verifiable patient outcomes, rather than analytical performance metrics. We started these more significant trials years ago and we're now starting to see that work come to fruition, as they read out. First, we were recently excited to present updated data at the ESMO GI Conference on the prospective real-world interventional CIRCULATE trial. There are now more than 2,000 patients enrolled in the study, with six months of follow-up available for the first 800 patients. We've maintained the high presurgical detection and longitudinal sensitivity and specificity to relapse from our validation studies in this prospective real-world setting and we finally got a substantive look at the initial outcomes data, based on MRD status. We are ecstatic to see that more than 99% of patients who are MRD-negative remain disease-free at the six-month median time point, regardless of whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy or not. This is a huge step forward and I'll explain why on the next slide. There's a key clinical utility question that needs to be answered in stage III colorectal patients. Can we avoid giving chemotherapy for MRD-negative patients? Today, in stage III colorectal cancer, nearly 100% of patients get adjuvant chemotherapy, but about 50% of patients don't need it, because they're cured by surgery alone. One of the biggest objections we get from doctors is that, they aren't ready to stop giving chemotherapy to stage III patients which would be against the NCCN guidelines. They agree, MRD testing today can be helpful in stage III colorectal to decide between three months versus six months of adjuvant chemotherapy, but what they really want is to confidently avoid giving chemotherapy to MRD-negative patients. The CIRCULATE trial was designed to test this hypothesis that MRD-negative patients could safely be deescalated from chemotherapy after surgery. On the left, you'll see a diagram of the patient flow in the CIRCULATE trial. In the bottom arm, each MRD-negative patient is randomized to receive standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy or not. We believe the study will ultimately show that there's no benefit to receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who are MRD-negative. The interim disease-free survival data strongly suggests that we are on track to validating that hypothesis, which could be a game-changer. This is a type of trial that can change guidelines and unlock one of the big clinical use cases that physicians are asking for, an indication where doctors simply won't use the test without this level of high-quality outcomes data. Since this trial was initiated three years ago, we believe this data will further differentiate us from further entrants in the market. We anticipate the results of the MRD-negative stratification will be presented for the first time at ASCO GI in January of 2022. If that reads out as we anticipated, that will be a defining moment for Signatera in colorectal cancer and we look forward to seeing the data. Deepening our data trove in colorectal cancer is one of our core strategies. And in addition to the new de-escalation indication described above, we also recently published a prospective trial in stage IV colorectal cancer that showed excellent performance, including overall survival results, unlocking another layer of colorectal utility beyond stage II and III. This paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Precision Oncology was an analysis from the prospective PREDATOR clinical trial, following 112 patients with stage IV disease, who underwent surgery with curative intent. At the first time point, 30 days post-surgery, from a single time point alone, we had sensitivity to relapse of 72%. This increased to 91% when we were able to test a second follow-up blood draw on those patients who did not receive adjuvant chemo. In addition, 96% of patients who were MRD-negative at the single time point after surgery were still alive at the end of clinical follow-up, which lasted up to 54 months. That compares to just 52% overall survival for patients that were Signatera positive. The overall survival rate increased to 100%, when including patients who remained MRD-negative in the longitudinal setting. This paper addresses an important unmet clinical need. Since guidelines are currently vague on which stage IV colorectal patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery with curative intent, it's currently recommended to monitor these patients closely for early signs of recurrence. On the basis of this publication, we have already submitted to Medicare to expand coverage under the current LCD to include stage IV oligometastatic patients, which we expect may come in late 2021 or early 2022. As a reminder, the opportunity here is sizable, as we estimate there are about 10,000 new diagnoses per year in stage IV oligometastatic colorectal cancer with the testing frequency similar to CEA, leading to a TAM of approximately 100,000 tests per year, which is sizable from historical standards. We're really proud of the studies we generated and we believe the shift to outcomes data, including prospective overall survival data, where we track patient outcomes for nearly five years and confirming one's validation data in a real-world interventional setting, is important to further penetrate the clinical market and get reimbursed at scale. We were also proud to see another prospective publication, with overall survival data this quarter in Nature, with the excellent results from the Phase III IMvigor010 muscle invasive bladder cancer trial that we did with Genentech. This trial was a major effort conducted over seven years to evaluate whether Genentech's immunotherapy drug atezolizumab could improve outcomes in the adjuvant muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Before reading out the data Genentech prespecified an endpoint to evaluate patient response -- patients who were Signatera-positive after surgery, in addition to the all-comers format originally designed. When the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint in all-comers, we reported a significant treatment benefit in Signatera MRD-positive patients that received atezolizumab and no treatment benefit in the MRD-negative patients. This study showed that Signatera is predictive of treatment benefit in this setting. This predictive claim is very difficult to make and it can only be achieved through a high-quality study such as this one. In addition to our predictive claim, we reported prospective data showing MRD-negative patients have a much better overall survival than MRD-positive patients. Based on the strength of these results, Genentech has already started enrolling patients in a sequel Phase III trial IMvigor011 that will randomize to atezolizumab versus placebo among only those patients who test Signatera positive after surgery. Demand is now growing quickly across pharma and academic consortia to incorporate Signatera as a companion diagnostic in their pivotal randomized trials. This week we announced our second major Phase III drug trial the ZEST trial. This is a randomized multicenter placebo-controlled study sponsored by GSK to evaluate their PARP inhibitor niraparib in 800 patients with early-stage either triple-negative breast cancer or HR-positive HER2-negative BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Patients who test positive after standard of care definitive treatment will be randomized to receive niraparib versus placebo. If this trial is successful, it could create a potentially life-saving new treatment option for patients who test MRD-positive in this setting. Positive study results would provide support for doctors to prescribe this treatment in their office broadly which would be incredibly powerful for overall clinical adoption of Signatera. Some indications like breast cancer are best approached through these types of pharma partnerships because the clinical utility in breast cancer recurrence monitoring depends on new treatments being administered at the time of molecular recurrence. And that's not something a laboratory can generally take on by itself. So we're glad to be winning these types of big treatment on molecular recurrence trials which will unlock future clinical indications for Signatera. This project was made possible by the strong validation data we previously published in breast cancer including both the paper in Clinical Cancer Research and the I-SPY 2 data published in Annals of Oncology. Okay. I'm staying on Medicare for another minute. As we mentioned at the top of the call, we had a major breakthrough this summer when Signatera was awarded an ADLT status. Before this when a patient completed their adjuvant treatment monitoring period and entered recurrence monitoring our pricing for Signatera had been set at $795 per time point. Now with the ADLT status the reimbursement rate is $3,500 per blood draw for Medicare patients and we think this could be relatively stable over time. Given the nature of the longitudinal monitoring, over time a higher and higher percentage of blood draws will fall into this category which bodes well for the overall gross margin in the long-term. ADLT status is designed to reward innovation and the relevant statute requires several criteria to be met. A test must be unique in the marketplace satisfying a clinical need that no other commercially available test can address and also must employ a methodology that's based on a unique empirically driven algorithm. Signatera met these stringent criteria and we believe it will be difficult for any other future MRD competitor to achieve this status adding to our first mover advantage. This also gives us an important lever when contracting with commercial plans in the future and it helps our pharma business since Natera is extending its commercial leadership in MRD, which makes us more attractive as a companion diagnostic partner. Finally, looking forward, we are eagerly awaiting the finalization of our draft LCD for immunotherapy monitoring, which we expect to come through sometime earlier this year. We've been pleased with the initial adoption in this setting further validating our belief that Signatera can help inform difficult treatment decisions for patients receiving immunotherapy where standard imaging tools can be uninformative. The final slide highlights some of the near and longer-term indications we are targeting with Signatera. In the past, we focused this side exclusively on the near-term indications on the left-hand side of the page. These are indications where we've already generated excellent data and the clinical utility and use cases are very clear and we have line of sight to reimbursement with CMS and commercial launches in the near-term. Those near-term indications stack up about -- to about four million tests per year which is incredible from historical standards. This is roughly 10 times larger than the 400,000 tests per year in the traditional therapy selection market for example. However, despite this TAM being incredibly large from historical standards this is just the beginning. With several pivotal randomized trials now underway in colorectal, bladder, breast and others sponsored by pharma and leading academic consortia and with a strong pipeline of additional trials that may launch in the next 12 months to 18 months it's clear that some very large opportunities are beginning to stack up in both the US and globally including in Japan. We're simply looking at what we signed so far or have in front of us. We have a path to coverage of up to an additional nine million tests per year. This is exciting because although we're having significant growth now and we have an excellent runway to success in the near-term I could easily make the case that Signatera is really only scratching the surface and just at the beginning. And we could really hit full stride in the middle of this decade and beyond as these very large pivotal trials read out. So there's a lot of upside in the future. Finally, not on the slide, but important to our mission we were proud this quarter as two patient case studies were reported out in the national media from different providers in different parts of the country. One colorectal case was reported on NPR's Here & Now broadcast and one breast cancer case reported on ABC's Good Morning America. We want to thank those patients Bonnie and Mariel and their physicians for sharing how Signatera made an impact in their journeys. Okay. Now let me hand it over to Mike to discuss the financials. Mike? Yes sure. That would be great. So the ADLT is a very significant advantage and it's only available to the first mover who has an innovative test on the market. So we're very glad that we were accepted into the program, and we were able to increase that recurrence monitoring price from $795 now up to $3,500 because over time as the flywheel effect of getting patients into recurrent ordering program occurs, you're going to have more and more and more of the patients at that recurrence monitoring time point. So it's critical that you maintain a high ASP in that time point. Now the way the program works is there's a time period. I believe it's roughly nine months where they look at your commercial claims. During that time period, you get paid the list price of $3,500. And then after that they look at your commercial claims and they'll reset your price based on the median weighted reimbursement from commercial parties. Now the good news is that we've been very strict about how we negotiate with private payers and we've successfully negotiated rates that are at or above this $3,500 price point with private payers. So we don't expect to see any price reductions on an ongoing basis through the PAMA process. Of course, it has to pay out -- play out over time, but at this stage all the rates we've negotiated are at $3,500 or higher and we expect to maintain the price point or have an increase. Yes. So there's a lot of work, I think to roll out each of the different indications. The good news is that the most important thing to being successful in the Signatera market is generating the right data. And we started that process of generating the data a long time ago five years ago roughly. You look at some of these trials, they were ongoing for that period of time. We had teams of people out hunting for clinical trials that we could get into five years ago. So now the studies are reading out and they're being published. That's the most important thing in order to unlock usage in a particular tumor type and to unlock reimbursement in a particular tumor type. So when we look at where we are in colorectal today stage II and III we're seeing a lot of volume come in. We're seeing a rapid increase in ordering on the clinical side, which is great and in line with our expectations. We've now generated this data in oligometastatic stage IV colorectal deepening our penetration in the colorectal space and that data looked excellent. I mean, really good data with overall survival as well, which is really the next step down in kind of raising the bar for what type of data is required to move the needle. I think we're going to continue to penetrate colorectal. We're on market with an immunotherapy monitoring product, which is going very well. We're seeing increases consistently in the usage there. We've also shown muscle-invasive bladder, lung, neoadjuvant breast, ovarian, multiple myeloma. Now we just had a publication in esophageal cancer. So all those areas where we generated data and we have published data, I think over time we'll be rolling out those indications. We're actually seeing usage today in a lot of those indications even though our sales team is not promoting. We're just getting inbound requests where doctors read the paper and then they want the test or patients hear about it and they want the test. So we are seeing usage although the vast majority of our business, today is colorectal and immunotherapy. So, that's sort of one sector that the near term kind of 4 million tests per year opportunity. Then there's the bigger sector that's unlocked through these partnerships by pharma -- with pharma. And we think that's like breast treatment on molecular recurrence for example; lung treatment on molecular recurrence. And these big Phase 3 clinical trials take time to read out, but when they do read out, they're going to be massive market-moving guideline changing trials. So, it's kind of a great setup where we have this significant amount of growth and work that we can do in the near term. And then when we get to the kind of mid to upper-2020s, we have the second wave of extreme growth that's unlocked by the investments that we're making today in the trials. So that's sort of how we see it playing out. And the other thing that I think is good about these big trials like, for example, the breast one that we just announced, once the competitive landscape is established here and there's maybe a handful of folks that are participating in these trials. It's going to be really hard for others to come behind. I mean these are seven-year -- five to seven-year prospective clinical trials. These are the type of things that really truly build a competitive moat that make it very difficult for others to come in behind. So we feel like we're in a good position in the short-term and to tap into that very significant upside that's going to come in the future. Yes, we -- yes, yes I was going to say -- Mike why don't you take that? Yes. Thanks Mark. Yes. So on the organ health side things are going really well. I think we're beating our plan, as we said, ahead of our expectations. We're starting to see some good data come out. We show this head-to-head study, which I think is now the second head-to-head study that's been performed where we've outperformed on the detection of rejection using the validated 1% cutoff. We showed now I think that our platform test works well in other organs. So the simultaneous pancreas-kidney pancreas alone transplants which is good. I think that essentially shows that we're going to be able to transport into other organs. And now that this LCD has been put in place, which is essentially an umbrella LCD that will allow us to go get reimbursed, if we choose to go into other areas. So I think the groundwork is all there. The sort of proof of concept is there. And I think we'll be in a good position to sort of make those moves in the future if that's an area that we decide to go into. I think when we look sort of across business, we have to kind of decide where we want to make the investments and so forth. But, certainly the kind of framework is in place there. On the early cancer detection side, we've basically said that we've developed a platform. We have some data that looks good. We have access to a significant number of samples and we're going to package all that up and describe it to everybody in the future when we're ready to. We just haven't done that yet. And so I think, that announcements will be coming where we're going to describe, what we're doing, what we have so far, and what our plans are. But we're just not rolling that out today. But we feel very good about the opportunity we have. Yeah, sure. So why don't I talk about the share gain, and then maybe Mike you can talk about like, how we're managing breaking stuff out. So, on the Women's Health side, we have been just crushing it. I mean, we're accelerating. You can see the growth over the last couple of years, and sort of what we're doing now. I mean, it's a whole definite level of growth. So we're in a fantastic position. We've got a great technology. We've made significant improvements to the technology that have been launched this year with Pano AI that's playing out very, very well in the field. Great customer feedback. We've now got the largest prospective trial that's ever been done in the field of NIPT, where the results in a real-world setting held up and actually were better than our validation data. So that's super strong. I think some of the big academic centers and maternal-fetal medicine practices that hadn't been using us before considering a switch are now looking at the data. And they're excited about it, because this type \u2013 this quality of data just hasn't been produced before. So yeah, we are having competitive wins, but we're also seeing the market penetrate. And so those two things simultaneously happening are causing an acceleration in the Women's Health growth. The market today, we believe is about 30% -- maybe 35% overall penetrated. So there's a long way to go just simply riding the wave of penetration in the market. And even, if we weren't seeing competitive wins our business would grow just simply from penetrating that market. We think in the next three years that NIPT market is going to get to 90% growth \u2013 or excuse me, 90% penetration. So that's a very significant growth. But on the competitive side, we're outpacing everyone else from a growth standpoint. We're taking business from competitors. You saw one main competitor exit the market and they were a very strong competitor for a long time. When they announced our sales team went to work and we've done exceptionally well. I think converting that business to Natera. Based on the numbers we're seeing, we believe we got more than our share of that business. So we're feeling very good about that. I think we're in a good position. So Mike, do you want to maybe comment just on how we're breaking out organ health or oncology from a unit and revenue standpoint? Great. Thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate it. Take care."

Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, May 06, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Michael Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our first quarter of 2021. On the line is Steve Chapman, our CEO; Bob Schueren, Chief Operating Officer; Solomon Moshkevich, General Manager of Oncology; and Paul Billings, Chief Medical Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be available at investor.natera.com.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes, as we discuss our financial performance and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let's get into the unit and financial highlights. As you can see from the press release, we had an exceptional quarter. We processed 348,000 tests in Q1, which is 18% growth over our record Q4 performance and 47% year-on-year growth. As our base of business has grown substantially, our growth rates have still continued to accelerate. That acceleration is being driven by continued strong growth in the women's health business, but also we are seeing some real benefit from oncology and organ health as well. Revenues were $152 million in the quarter, which included a $28 million acceleration of revenue recognition from our deal with QIAGEN, which wound down in Q1. Net revenue is a non-cash accounting benefit as we will explain later in the call, but even stripping QIAGEN out of the results revenue growth was very strong. For example, the year-on-year product revenue growth was 36%. As a result of the incredible momentum we're seeing in the business, I'm pleased to significantly raise our guidance for the year by $50 million. We are now targeting $550 million to $575 million, which represents a complete reset of the range. I'll give you some of the key highlights on those trends now before giving more detail later in the call. First, we're very pleased to launch our new Panorama AI algorithm for broad use in our lab during Q1. We built a new algorithm using data for more than 2 million cell-free DNA tests and we validated the performance as part of our SMART study, the results of which we released in February of this year. Phase I of the Panorama AI launch reduces cost of goods sold for Panorama and also cuts our no call rate in half while maintaining market-leading sensitivity, which dramatically improves our customers' experience. Moving on to organ health. We are a few quarters into the Prospera launch for kidney transplant rejection, and it's going very well. We found that there was a broad base of customers eager to adopt cell-free DNA testing, and we're continuing to innovate and push the science forward. More recently, Medicare issued new coverage guidance for donor-derived cell-free DNA testing enabling coverage beyond kidney transplants. The technology required for detecting transplant rejections in other organs such as heart or lung is essentially the same technology we use for Prospera. So it's very encouraging to see a pathway to reimbursement for these other organ types. In oncology, we're at the early stages of our Signatera clinical launch, and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our pharma business. We have a lot of exciting updates to share with you today. On our last earnings call, we reviewed the results of our groundbreaking IMvigor010 study with Genentech, which looked at using atezolizumab in adjuvant muscle-invasive bladder cancer. While the drug did not meet its primary endpoint, in the all-comers population, there was a significant treatment benefit in those patients, who were Signatera positive prior to receiving treatment. Based on these results, we were happy to move very quickly with Genentech to set up a second Phase III trial IMvigor011, which if successful could position us favorably to obtain FDA approval for Signatera as a companion diagnostic to atezolizumab in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. IMvigor011 has already started enrolling patients. These types of studies with pharmaceutical companies are all part of the data flywheel we've described in the past. Paid studies with pharma generate high quality data that can be later used for reimbursement approvals and guideline changes. The powerful IMvigor010 results have also driven additional demand with our pharma business development efforts. For example, we recently received two additional FDA breakthrough device designations for major new Signatera indications outside of colorectal cancer and we look forward to providing additional information as our pharma partners publicly disclose these trials. In addition to the expansion in bladder cancer and the new FDA Breakthrough Device Designations at AACR a few weeks ago, we presented compelling data in ovarian cancer together with our collaborators from UCSF Columbia and UPMC. Signatera significantly outperformed the standard-of-care serum-based monitoring test for ovarian cancer, CA-125 and it predicted relapse an average of 10 months before radiographic recurrence. Ovarian is an indication that's very important to us given our history in women's health and given the very high recurrence rate and low overall survival rates. We also plan to present positive early multiple myeloma data in a few weeks at ASCO. We expect Signatera to address a major unmet medical need in this cancer type. Today, MRD testing and monitoring are already the standard of care in multiple myeloma, but the problem is that existing MRD tests require a bone marrow biopsy each time the patient is monitored. Bone marrow biopsies are painful and expensive, a few thousand dollars each, so many patients avoid getting tested. After initial setup, Signatera offers the chance to monitor for recurrence with a simple blood sample and without the added costs of the additional bone marrow biopsy that's required for ongoing monitoring with other MRD tests. I'm also pleased for the first time to publicly announce an interim readout from the international prospective CIRCULATE-IDEA trial, which has already enrolled its first 1500 CRC patients. As we described in the past, CIRCULATE is a landmark prospective trial designed to be process changing in early-stage CRC. In the interim readout, Signatera delivered longitudinal sensitivity to relapse of greater than 93%, which compares favorably to the 69% longitudinal sensitivity recently published by a tumor na\u00efve competitor. Data on the first 400 patients from the trial will also be presented in June at ASCO. So clearly our momentum continues as we build upon our leadership position in each of these business areas. Okay. Now let me move on to the business trends. The next slide is our volume progression over time, where the Q1 in each year is highlighted in green. Those of you that have followed the company know we get some seasonal benefit in NIPT volumes during Q1, but the increase we saw in Q1 this year was significant. You can visually see the acceleration of the business in the last few quarters compared to historical trends. We're benefiting from successful launches in our organ health and oncology businesses, which are both going very well and meeting our expectations and we're also seeing continued momentum in the women's health business. NIPT's sequential quarterly growth rates accelerated once again in Q1 and carrier screening tests also increased proportionally. These trends were fueled by very strong new account wins and account retention trends that were even higher than our historical averages. I also think we're starting to see the first signs of broad average risk market penetration that we've been waiting on for a long time, more on that in a moment. The next slide shows the revenue trajectory continuing on pace as well. Obviously, Q1 is a bit of an outlier given the QIAGEN revenue recognition of $28 million. Some of you will recall, we collected a large upfront cash payment from QIAGEN in return for our commitment to offer clinical content for their sequencing program, which they subsequently wound down. Most of that cash was non-refundable, so now that the deal has been formally ended, we have now recognized the remaining cash on our books as revenue for the work we performed. If you focus beyond that one-time event, however, you'll see we significantly exceeded revenue expectations in Q1 with a roughly $124 million organic quarter and a 36% product revenue growth. Mike will spend more time on this later in the call, but we were cautious in our revenue accrual, given we just recently received a lot of reimbursement decisions in our favor. The outlook for ASPs throughout the course of the year looks positive. One of the reasons we can maintain our leadership in NIPT is that we continue to invest in new improvements in the technology. The Pano AI Phase I launch is the most recent example. We showed in the SMART trial that this new algorithm boosted our PPV for microdeletions to 53%, which is significantly better than what others have published. Any in core aneuploidy testing, Pano AI Phase I achieved a 50% reduction in NIPT no-call rates while maintaining our market-leading sensitivity and specificity. This allows us to more efficiently meet the rapidly growing demand for Panorama and is yet another positive talking point for the sales team. We are not finished with improvements to Panorama, and I look forward to sharing additional phases of Panorama AI with you later this year. As you can see on the next slide, we're thinking we're well positioned to take advantage of the NIPT market expanding in the wake of the ACOG and SMFM practice bulletins posted last fall. The continued account wins make sense because we've got exciting new talking points with the launch of Pano AI, and we're seeing upside from the presentation of the SMART trial data earlier this year at SMFM. We're uniquely leveraging the power of SNPs to deliver best-in-class performance and differentiated clinical value. We've now studied more than 1.3 million patients in over 23 peer-reviewed publications. Now with the completion of the SMART trial, we have the validation data for the largest and most rigorous study aneuploidy and microdeletion testing. Combine that with our seasoned clinical and commercial teams, and we're well positioned for the increase in NIPT adoption that we expect to see over the next several years. Okay. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our recent progress in organ health. We've been pleased with the progress of our launch, which is in line with our expectations. In addition to growing commercial volume, one of our goals has been to push the science forward in a meaningful way, and we've made great progress. For example, we've recently developed a method to routinely check the background cell-free DNA in each sample and now we inform physicians when we see exceptionally high background cell-free DNA, which can potentially mask transplant rejections. The first example of this technology was just published in Transplant Direct, showing the impact of COVID-19 on background cell-free DNA levels. It turns out that COVID-19 causes background cell-free DNA levels to spike dramatically, which can potentially mask rejection if you're only looking at the donor-derived cell-free DNA percentage. This example in COVID-19 is important, but we believe it's not the only use case for Natera's technology. There are many factors that cause an increase in background cell-free DNA. And we think, ultimately, it's going to be important to be able to flag the patients where this is occurring. On the next slide, we were thrilled with the recent local coverage decision from Medicare, which we think could open up a pathway to reimbursement for Prospera in a range of organ transplant settings beyond just kidney. There's no reason why our technology shouldn't work very well in other organ types. And we are, of course, pleased to see one of the major hurdles, reimbursement, essentially removed from the equation as we evaluate these other additional expansion opportunities. With that, let me hand the call over to Solomon to give some more detail on our efforts in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. We have had a flurry of important milestones and announcements recently. So I'm happy to provide some further detail. Genentech has followed up rapidly since the release of the IMvigor010 results incorporating Signatera as a companion diagnostic for atezolizumab in a global prospective Phase III trial called IMvigor011, natural sequel. The results from the first Phase III released last fall are on the left-hand side of the page. You can see that the 37% of bladder cancer patients identified as MRD-positive by Signatera had a clear survival benefit from treatment with atezo with a hazard ratio of 0.59, while the MRD-negative patients had no benefit. In IMvigor011, which is already underway, patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be screened after surgery to 500 who are MRD positive. And those patients will be randomized to receive atezo or a placebo. If successful, Natera would seek FDA approval for Signatera as a continued diagnostic to atezolizumab for this intended use. This is the first of many registrational trials for Signatera as the IMvigor010 data has been recognized as a major proof of concept with application across cancer types. Okay. Now I'd like to cover the preliminary data set that we are releasing today in colorectal cancer. As Steve described, this is the first of many data readouts we expect from the large prospective CIRCULATE-IDEA trial that is running now in Japan with plans to expand to the U.S. and Europe. As we've described in the past, this trial is led by the National Cancer Center East in Japan, with over 150 clinical sites actively enrolling across the country. And the primary goal of which is to definitively assess whether stage III colorectal cancer patients who test MRD-negative with Signatera can be safely deescalated from chemotherapy. Slide has the key headlines. Based on the interim analysis, Signatera showed a presurgical sensitivity of 94%, which is even better than the 89% published in our validation paper with Reinert et. al in 2019. This also compares favorably to the 47% sensitivity reported recently by Parikh et. al, using a competing MRD test called Reveal, which is not tumor informed. The presurgical sensitivity ought to be very high in colorectal cancer, near 100%, given that patients have the cancer in their body, they have not had any prior systemic therapy and CRC is known as a tumor type with a high rate of ctDNA shed. This is a metric that can be compared relatively easily across different tests. Furthermore, out of 31 recurrence events thus far recorded in the study, Signatera has detected 29 out of 31 or 93.5% in longitudinal testing, which again is better than the 88% we published in Reinert et. al, and again, compares favorably to the 69% longitudinal sensitivity reported by Parikh, et. al. We are pleased to see that our performance metrics are improving in the prospective setting, given all the technical improvements we've implemented since our launch in 2019. Finally, we're seeing a sample failure rate in this study of less than 3%, including both tissue and plasma, which compares very favorably to the double-digit failure rate in plasma alone reported by Parikh, et. al. As we've seen from our experience in NIPT, these rates of success and failure have a significant impact on clinical utility and adoption. Data from a subset of this group will be presented in a few weeks at ASCO, and we look forward to continuing our momentum in Japan over the coming months and years. This next slide provides a more comprehensive comparison between the performance data available with Signatera versus the data reported on the Reveal test. Drawing on the breadth and depth of evidence behind Signatera, specifically in CRC and across other solid tumors, we believe the science is clear that personalized and tumor-informed MRD testing is the way to go. In addition to the sensitivity advantages that I described a moment ago in both the presurgical and postsurgical settings, I want to highlight the significant difference in diagnostic lead time with these two different products. Using serial longitudinal testing, Reinert et. al reported that Signatera detected residual disease on average 8.7 months ahead of radiographic recurrence, whereas by our estimate, Parikh et. al observed a lead time of approximately four months. We believe the more sensitive and useful test is the one that will pick up the cancer recurrence earlier before it becomes radiographically or clinically apparent. Beyond that, there are a number of other clinical advantages with Signatera. One important one is the ability to quantitate the ctDNA level. In addition to reporting presence or absence of tumor DNA, Signatera also provides a quantitative metric that allows physicians to track tumor growth and dynamics over time. We already know that this is critical for treatment monitoring, which led to the draft LCD for Medicare in immunotherapy monitoring, but we will soon report new data at ASCO with our collaborators from Aarhus University showing how this quantitative signal can also be clinically useful during recurrence monitoring in CRC. By comparison, the Reveal test, which relies on a black box combination of genomic and epigenomic signatures, does not quantitate. As a reminder, Signatera is being ordered clinically now by hundreds of physicians, not only in CRC, but across many different cancer types. To that point, the next slide covers a couple of major new indications where we are producing positive data. On the left is the data we released at AACR in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal malignancy, with an average five-year survival rate of only 47%. Right now, a serum-based biomarker called CA125 is commonly used for recurrence detection, but it lacks sensitivity and specificity, similar to CEA in colorectal cancer. In the study we presented at AACR, patients were tested with Signatera before surgery and then a smaller set were tested serially after surgery. We reported that 100% of the patients who cleared their tumor DNA with surgery and treatment remained relapse-free, while 100% of the patients who stayed ctDNA positive after surgery went on to relapse. Signatera provided an average diagnostic lead time of about 10 months. We are also very excited about the data to be presented at ASCO in multiple myeloma. The annual incidence of this disease is about 35,000, and there are approximately 150,000 people in the U.S. living with a prior diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Most of these patients go into remission after initial treatment, but then they are actively monitored for many years, often for the rest of their lives. The big clinical opportunity here is to provide accurate monitoring and MRD assessment using serial blood sampling, instead of requiring serial bone marrow specimens like the current labs do. The data coming up at ASCO will be a first look at what the performance could look like in blood using Signatera. Our plan in both of these indications is to continue building our data sets to pursue reimbursement from payers, including Medicare, and to enable prospective trials in partnership with pharma companies. We believe these new indications expand our addressable market opportunity to approximately 3 million tests per year in the U.S., and that does not even begin to address the global opportunity, which is real considering our momentum in Japan, a partnership with BGI in China and our clinical development activities in Europe. We are also very pleased with the progress in our Foundation Medicine partnership, and we look forward to providing additional updates on this throughout the year. With our strong commercial channel in the U.S. calling on community and academic oncologists, we look forward to expanding access to Signatera for more and more patients over time. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The slide here is just a summary set of results for the quarter. Steve covered a lot of the trends on volumes and revenues. And you can see revenues have expanded significantly even stripping out the one-time QIAGEN revenue recognition. The organic quarter significantly exceeded our internal expectations. It's worth noting that we have had a lot of new positive reimbursement decisions across the business, both with Medicare for Signatera and major commercial payers for average risk NIPT. Given we have less history with reimbursement in these areas; we were cautious in accruing revenue for the recorded volumes in Q1. At the same time, volumes obviously ramped incredibly quickly in Q1. So that caution on ASPs tempered the product gross margins in the quarter compared to what we think is achievable in the immediate term. So based on this and the good underlying recent actuals we are seeing, we are optimistic that accrued ASPs can improve over the next few quarters. Cost of goods sold per unit was excellent in the quarter, driven by continued COGS progress in the women's health products. We had about $20 million in bigger ticket nonrecurring cash outflows in the quarter. For example, we did refund $10 million of QIAGEN's initial $38 million cash payment. Despite that, we are still on track for our original cash burn guide as I'll discuss on the next slide. Okay. On to the next slide and the revised guide. Steve gave you the headline that we are resetting the guide higher as a result of our Q1 experience. The change in the guidance range well exceeds the QIAGEN contribution and the organic driver of the guidance reset is almost entirely driven by revising the volume forecast upward. The improved gross margin guide is driven by the QIAGEN revenue and reflects the same cost of goods sold per unit assumptions we've had previously. The COGS trends look good as we've discussed. In terms of quarterly revenue pacing, I do think the seasonality we've historically seen in the business is still relevant and should be taken into account. Generally, the volume trends in women's health lead to a slightly more muted sequential growth in Q2 and then expanding growth rates in Q3 and Q4. Partly in response to the increased demand across the business lines, we are marginally stepping up some investments in SG&A and R&D to support the growth. For example, we are accelerating investments for lab operations, infrastructure and staffing that we had initially planned to make next year, but the volume is exceeding our initial forecast, and so we are accelerating our expansion plans. The net impact of all of these changes to the forecast is the cash burn guide remains the same. We remain in a very strong cash position, and we'll continue to invest. We talked about the women's health business getting to cash flow breakeven this year and we feel even more confident in that goal at this point in the year. So it's an exciting time for Natera and we are very excited to have been able to share these results with you. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hi, guys. Good evening and congrats on the strong quarter here. Steve, let me \u2013 I'd like to start with a question on the CIRCULATE-IDEA data that you just presented, looks pretty impressive. Is there anything more you can share in terms of just the competitive positioning versus a tumor agnostic approach? Do you think the metrics that you've just shown via CIRCULATE-IDEA and I'm sure there's more to come will be enough to kind of like put enough daylight, so to speak, between you and peers where you get a commercial sort of leg up there. And then finally, in terms of the plans to accelerate liquid exome from RUO into the clinic, how does that look now that you have this data out there? Do you feel like you're pretty comfortable continuing to rely on the tissue exome? Or is that an effort you'll still pursue from a point of view of shortening the turnaround time for the assay?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I would say, at a very high level we think we stack up very, very well to the tumor naive approaches that are out there. And to the other tumor informed approaches that are out there, frankly. I mean, when you look at the breadth of data and the performance, we have a very significant lead and a great position compared to the other groups that are coming into this space. So we're doing well. We're on market. The volume is growing. The launch is successful. I feel like we're in a very strong position. As far as building personalized approaches off of liquid exome, I think that that's something that we have the capability to do and it's something that we're considering, but we don't feel like it's required at this point, just given the success that we're seeing. Solomon, would you like to add any additional points?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes, I think one other part of the question was related to the CIRCULATE-IDEA trial data. So we're very pleased with the interim results we're seeing from that trial. It is the largest perspective MRD trial of its kind. And it's enrolling very well. There's a lot of excitement on the physician and patient side to be a part of this and the data is looking even better than what we had published previously. So yes, we think this is an important validation of what we've seen before and it sets us up to only improve the adoption of the test, not only in clinical use, but also in other clinical trials because it's such a good feasibility demonstration of how this can work in a clinical trial. So we're very optimistic. And we look forward to presenting additional data at ASCO in a few weeks.\nTejas Savant: Got it. And Solomon just a quick follow up there on the ASCO multiple myeloma data that you highlighted. How do you think the use case here would shape up relative to some of the immuno-sequencing assays like clonoSEQ from Adaptive, for example? Do you essentially sort of view this as being a blood-based approach and perhaps in multiple myeloma it's unclear yet whether they can be sort of bone marrow or blood based? Is that really the angle that you're taking here?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. Thank you for your question. Without being able to present the data itself at this time, it will be shown in detail at ASCO. Yes, the general concept here is just like \u2013 it's the same Signatera product. So we start with a sample of the tumor, which in this case comes from the bone marrow biopsy for that initial analysis and personalized assay design. And once that's done, we just analyze the plasma going forward serially. And that is \u2013 presents a massive opportunity to improve the clinical utility and accessibility of MRD and monitoring for the 35,000 multiple myeloma patients per year and the 150,000, that have had a prior diagnosis because those patients today without Signatera require serial bone marrow biopsies in order to continue their monitoring, and that's a painful procedure, that's a very expensive procedure and frankly patients simply avoid it because of those hurdles in it. So with Signatera, we think if we can consistently show a similar performance that's clinically sufficient, then not only will people switch over to using Signatera in this setting, but we think the overall use of monitoring and MRD testing will just go up because of the improved accessibility.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. I'll start with a couple on Signatera as we think about kind of CRC in the IO and Altera ramp, have your kind of assumptions for kind of the back half of the year ramp changed at all? And then I just want to make sure I understand your answer to the last question, because your competitors, like Adaptive are moving toward a blood draw, a blood first approach away from bone marrow. So I'm just trying to understand competitively if that changes things in your perspective on multiple myeloma.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, so I'll comment on the ramp. I mean, we haven't broken out our Signatera numbers or Prospera numbers specifically, but you can see our volume growth is going very well. And that includes what we believe is a very successful launch for Signatera and our other products. So, it's in line with our expectations. We're seeing good adoption. The test is working very well. And so we're pleased with the trajectory. I think on the question of multiple myeloma, so currently to run the monitoring assays that are available, you have to do repeat bone marrow biopsies in order to do that ongoing monitoring. So with the test that we're working on, you do one bone marrow biopsy for the set-up, and then all the ongoing draws are just blood draws. So there is no need for a repeat bone marrow biopsy.\nTycho Peterson: And Steve, what's the latest thinking from your perspective around screening? It's probably one of the top three questions we get on you guys. Can you maybe just share your thoughts a little bit about how you're thinking about that opportunity either organically or inorganically over time?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, are you talking about early cancer screening?\nTycho Peterson: Correct.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we've said actually recently I think on our last call that we do have a program in that space and that's an area that we're moving into. We're actually making progress. We didn't announce anything today, but the program is underway. We think we have a very efficient approach to go after that market, both technically and from a validation and commercialization standpoint. And we will be providing updates in the future, but we're not going to be providing any today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel: Hi, good afternoon everybody and thank you for taking my questions. So I just want to start on really volume trends and guidance. I think it looks like just doing some quick math that you were doing about 25,000 tests per week in Q1, which if I got that right, it's pretty remarkable keeping in mind, that's a big step up from where we've been. I'm just wondering if you could comment on how that trended over the course of the quarter? Was it pretty steady or did it continue to improve into the end of the quarter? And then kind of building off of that and just using that 25,000 tests per week in the context of full year guidance, I can get to the low end of your range with pretty nominal improvement in that figure and nominal pricing improvements. I'm not sure either of those assumptions make a ton of sense given what feels like strong momentum and various things that you called out that could drive ASP improvement, including accruals a higher mix of Prospera and Signatera, things like that. So I just want to make sure I'm not doing something wrong and assuming I'm not, it's the low end of guidance, just reflecting a scenario where you want to be conservative early in the year.\nMichael Brophy: Hi, Doug. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. Yes. I mean, I think your summary is basically spot on. The only caveat I'd have is something that I've mentioned in the prepared remarks was just a reminder on the seasonality of the business, particularly the women's health business, which is the majority of the volume still. And that is \u2013 historically, we've seen a strong Q1 and then the same clinic volumes are a lot lighter in Q2. And so, you see like kind of a flattish Q2 and then a kind of growth in Q3 and Q4. So we are taking into account back kind of seasonality still even though clearly, I mean, you can see from I think the first \u2013 one of the first couple of slides in the deck that something different is going on right now in terms of the trajectory and I think that's really positive. You can see that in the weekly. So the weekly volumes through this call are looking quite strong. But we do \u2013 I think the only thing I would add to your summary is the seasonality point, which I think would \u2013 I think would temper the model slightly there. But obviously when we guide, we don't \u2013 we try not to give aspirational guidance. We try to give guidance that we think is \u2013 that we think we're going to hit. So I think \u2013 I would certainly hope that the low end of any guide that we give is something that we thought we could do.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, super helpful. And then just a couple on NIPT. Anything you can share on how mix is evolving and really reimbursement is evolving, obviously a lot of progress last year on the average risk guideline and reimbursement front. I'm just wondering if there's anything new in terms of how that is impacting mix and ASP? And then on microdeletions, anything new in terms of progress towards incremental reimbursement, probably pretty early for that, but any anything you could share would be of interest. Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Mike, maybe I'll comment on volumes and then if you want to follow-on on ASPs\u2026\nDoug Schenkel: Yes.\nSteve Chapman: From a volume standpoint, I think we are starting to see the long-awaited shift over towards average risk. And when we look at the growth in Q1, it's really coming from two factors. So, one is new wins from competitive takeaways. So we had our best quarter ever for growth coming from new customers and competitive takeaways. And the second thing that we're seeing is a shift towards average risk. So when we look at the mix of volume coming in this high risk versus average risk, we're starting to really see that needle move for a long time, for years it was very steady. And over the last six months, we've seen kind of a linear ramp up. And so, we think the markets moving now toward a place where it's \u2013 maybe it was 20% penetrated on average risk before, I think we're starting to get up into the 30% average risk penetration. So there is a long way to go. We're at the very early stages, but it's happening. And we're doing well both in absorbing that penetration, but also winning new customers and taking business away from others. Mike, want to comment on ASPs?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. The recent ASP trends were quite strong for NIPT. I mean, it's kind of happening as we've described that would. We're contracted for an NIPT code and the fraction of time we're getting paid is just steadily increasing. It takes a couple of quarters for that to flow into the revenue line, just based on the way that we do the accrual, we really need a critical mass of historical actuals to kind of get full credit for that, the way we do the accrual and that's \u2013 perhaps that's a bit cautious but we would like to be a little bit careful when we do that. So I'm cautiously optimistic as I mentioned in the prepared remarks about ASP trends for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.\nWestley Dupray: Hi, great. Good afternoon. This is actually on for Puneet today. I wanted to go back to MRD briefly, just for the first question, and I guess having been on the market for the better portion of the year and reimbursement since, I think, last October in CRC at least, I guess, what have you learned about the market itself? And then what feedback from potential customers who are kind of on the verge about MRD testing, in general? What are you hearing from them? What are your expectations for being able to drive penetration in stage II, III CRC still and also in some of the newer indications and potential timing on multiple myeloma?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, so I'll make some comments and then Solomon you can jump in. So, in general, the feedback has been very positive. I mean, if you go back four years ago, when we first started talking about this, nobody was talking about solid tumor MRD, or MRD testing in the adjuvant setting. And now if you're an oncology diagnostic company, you have to have an MRD product. Everybody is trying to move into this space. And that's really a validation of the enormous market opportunity. When you look at colorectal alone, there is a million tests that could be done per year. So these market sizes that we're talking about here are orders of magnitude bigger than anything else in the specialty diagnostics space and certainly much, much bigger than the therapy selection market alone where traditionally a lot of the energies have been focused. So we're really happy about how things are going. We're seeing the use from doctors accelerate. We're seeing lots of repeat use from patients and doctors. We're seeing use in all different stages of colorectal. We're seeing use beyond colorectal. We're getting a lot of great patient stories and great physician stories about how the test worked as advertised and how it helped your patients. So we're pleased with how things are going. Solomon, do you want to jump in on that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. I agree with everything that was said. Of course, we've learned a ton about how people want to use this test and where they find it to be useful and to inform treatment. I think one of the interesting things that we've seen in addition to what Steve described is that a lot of the time we've \u2013 there are already patients who are somewhere midstream in their course of care. And many, many of our tests get ordered for patients for the first time who are six, 12, 18, 24 months out of surgery because they had some indeterminate scan. Some nodules showed up, something that was suspicious, but it's hard to assess for the physician. And more and more people are coming to us to help them triage a borderline situation, whether it's do I treat or not? Or in this case, do I perform a biopsy on this module that's indeterminate or not? How do I proceed? And once people see data come back and they start to grow comfortable with what the test can do, the adoption just increases significantly. And the other thing I'll say that Steve mentioned, but we've been very impressed to see how sticky the product is once a patient is on it, the repeat use and the frequency is frankly above our expectations. And it matches what it should be, frankly, because it's just such an informative test over time. So I'm sure there's more I could say there, but I'll stop at that point.\nWestley Dupray: Great. Great. Thank you. And then on the women's health side, just speaking on the average risk market specifically, Steve, you just mentioned it's about \u2013 you think it's around the 30% penetration right now. I guess what's differentiating about Panorama and, I guess, Natera's combined offering that can help drive the remaining 70% of that market? And what are you seeing that's driving the competitive wins? And then just finally, a follow-up on the last question, any update on the microdeletion timing? Thanks.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So one of the reasons, if you look back at Natera's history, we were the fourth company into the NIPT space, but today, we're the market leader by far. We have the most clinical differentiation. We have the most peer-reviewed published data, and we're doing the most volume. And the reason is because our test is unique and differentiated and physicians like it. So we're the only company out of all the other companies that are out there that are looking at SNPs. And when you use SNPs, you're able to identify things that simply biologically can't be identified by the other companies, things like triploidy, for example, that are very relevant in pregnancy. But it also allows us to get higher sensitivity and specificity on things like trisomy 21 and [indiscernible] chromosomes. When you shift over to something like 22q microdeletion disorder, and you look at the performance using SNPs there versus the shotgun sequencing method, I mean, it's really night and day, the difference in the performance. I mean we're talking about sensitivity in the 90s versus others that have published performance sensitivity in the 20s. So the technique works exceptionally well, and that's now being shown out in the volumes. On the microdeletion standpoint, we now have published \u2013 or have presented and intend to be published the largest prospective trial that has ever been done in the microdeletion space. The results look exceptional. There were two key findings on microdeletions. One is that the 22q disease is much more common than what was previously expected at approximately one in 1,500. The \u2013 and the second was that our test works really, really well. So the sensitivity was very high. And the positive predictive value was also very high. And those are two of the \u2013 I guess, combined those are the three things, disease incidence, sensitivity, specificity that societies look at when they are deciding whether or not something meets the criteria to be approved for a prenatal screening test. So we think we're in a good position to, at some point in the future, get into the guidelines and receive payer coverage. And we're doing hundreds of thousands of these tests already every year that are not reimbursed. So as soon as reimbursement comes in, this is going to be an immediate, very significant impact to Natera's revenue and the bottom line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with BTIG.\nMark Massaro: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess, it's exciting to hear that you have a program in place in early cancer detection. You guys are a women's health company. You've shown promising data in ovarian cancer initially. So when I think about the \u2013 certainly the promise of developing an ovarian cancer screening test or breast cancer screening test, the market has never seen that. So can you maybe just talk about your plans of either going indication by indication or perhaps looking at the multi-cancer screening opportunity?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks Mark. I think the initial area that we're looking at is colorectal, and I think similar to some of the others in the space. And then ideally, that would be expanding beyond CRC into just some of the other cancer types. But I would just say, wait until we provide a more significant update that will be coming. It's not something that we included in the call today, but there will be some solid updates coming in the future.\nMark Massaro: Okay. That's helpful. And just my follow-up question. Obviously, Adaptive have done a great job in blood cancer, it's certainly interesting that you're showing data in MM. Do you think there are any limitations to \u2013 I think perhaps there's a reason why you started in solid tumors? Obviously, it's a bigger market. But are there any technical limitations of addressing blood cancers? I know Adaptive is looking primarily at lymphoid but not myeloid. So I don't know if you have any tough\u2019s on any technical limitations of your technology in blood cancers?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I'd just say the data that we have coming out at ASCO is going to speak for itself. It's early, but you'll see when you attend the conference. We think it's very positive. Of course, there's more work to be done there, but we don't think that there's technical limitations in this particular indication. Solomon, do you want to add to that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. I think it's hard to speak in generalities. So of course, there are going to be \u2013 yes, there's going to be technical matters we have to sort through along the way with all different types of either new indications or new specimen types or other biological variations that we're going to learn more about. But just speaking to the facts here, we're going to present great data in multiple myeloma. And I think there's a real opportunity to help a lot of patients here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with Piper Sandler.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. We spent a lot of time on oncology today, so I'll just ask you a few on transplant and women's health. So first on transplant, can you guys just give us some color on the launch and how penetration has been with transplant centers versus community nephrologists? And then also regarding the blanket LCD for transplant testing, you mentioned heart and lung. So can you talk about your timing expectations for addressing those other organs with Prospera?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thank you. So we are pleased with how the launch is going. We have been out there now a handful of quarters, and things are in line with our expectations. We think we have a unique technology that competes very well in the areas that matter. I think that the paper that we showed here in the earnings deck, I think, highlights one important factor where we've already, in a very short period of time, completely moved the science forward. This issue of background cell-free DNA is very important. If you're looking at a metric donor-derived cell-free DNA percentage, but the background cell-free DNA is very, very high, you can mask rejection, and you can have a false negative result. And so we are now incorporating that and flagging cases where there's a very high background cell-free DNA. And that was what was covered in this paper with UCLA that looked at this COVID case study. Yes, so we are doing well. The community nephrology space, I think there's an opportunity, and that's something where we are seeing some volume come in. But certainly, I think the transplant centers are the larger opportunity in the near-term. When you look at expansion into other organs, we are \u2013 we sort of accessing what opportunities are out there for us, but there is no reason why or technology should not work very, very well and heart, lung and other indications and now there the reimbursement hurdle has been cleared, it\u2019s certainly makes it a more attractive opportunity for us. If you look at some of our competitors and the volumes they are presenting in some of these other areas like heart, it's compelling. And we know our technology works well. We know we can get reimbursed very easily now with this new imbursement guideline, and so it's something we're assessing. And we're going to have to consider whether it makes sense for us.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thanks. Next question from me. So for women's health, you guys have mentioned that you're taking share from competitors, which is great. So can you just spend a minute on your women's health sales force? Do you guys think that your sales team's rightsized to address this larger average risk market? And then what are your thoughts on keeping our business profitable versus expanding out the women's health efforts to take share, especially as average risk and then potentially microdeletions opens up that opportunity? Thanks.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we\u2019ve been able to grow the business with some incremental increases in operating expenses that we've kind of layered in over time. So I think we're in a good position right now as far as our kind of reach and frequency on the women's health team. Of course, we're always monitoring and sort of and sort of looking at things, but I don\u2019t think that there is any \u2013 any big changes at this point that we would anticipate. When you look at the path towards profitability and towards cash flow breakeven, I mean that path at point is very clear, the women's health side. I mean we're seeing \u2013 so with this Pano AI launch that we announced the Phase I implementation and then the remaining phases in the year, this is a big COGS savings on NIPT. We haven't talked about that in a long time, but our COGS on NIPT now are well below $200 per test. I well below because of the scale that we're operating at, because of things like Pano AI, where we're now incorporating where we are incorporating deep neural networks and machine learning from over 2 million tests that we run in our lab and we are using that to reduce the costs of the workflow and of the reagents that we put into the assay. So major COGS reductions that are hitting and I think that cap to cash flow breakeven is very clear. We're always looking out for incremental investments, but I think we're in a good position right now in women's health.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum.\nTrenton McCarthy: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Trenton McCarthy jumping on for Alex. Just one quick question on NIPT and it's been six months or so since the ACOG guidelines came out. And we've heard a lot of local charters have been trending on the changes. So are you hearing in the \u2013 what are you hearing in the field? Are more clinicians embracing the guidelines and ordering more tests? If you could just give a little bit more color on that?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, it's definitely happening. We've seen over the past six months a linear shift in the percentage of our business that is average risk versus high risk. So that's definitely happening. It's going to continue. We think that the endpoint for this is going to be around 90% penetration, 95% penetration. And we think we can get there in three, four years something in that range. Maybe even less. Right now I think the market is 30% penetrated, so there is a long way to go. I mean NIPT growth is just really starting to ramp right down. We're just at the very beginning, and we are positioned and we are in a incredible position. We have a great sales team. They're tenured. We have the most data. We have the best performing product on the market. So we're in great position to ride the wave of expansion in average risk NIPT.\nTrenton McCarthy: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just a pivot over to Signatera here. You obviously now breaking out Signatera's CRC which makes it kind of hard to gauge performance, but what sort of penetration do you want to see this year, next year 2023, so that you could say, yes, Natera was successful here, if that makes sense.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So when you look at a lot of the historical cancer diagnostic launches, the companies that have been very successful Foundation Medicine or Genomic Health, you go back and what you see is in the first year, sort of a lower single digit penetration in the second year kind of a mid-single digit penetration into the market. And then the third year, maybe high single digit, low-double digit penetration. And that sort of what we use to kind of draft our forecast and I think its inline with other specialty diagnostics that are out there now. The data coming out, I mean we are putting so much really compelling data out, I mean it's almost every month, there is a massive announcement coming out of every conference we are now having multiple presentation. I think things could really start to accelerate, but that\u2019s kind of what we set out as the benchmark for success just from a historical perspective, and we are pleased \u2013 very pleased with where we are right now in the launch.\nOperator: We are showing no further questions in queue at this time. We now conclude today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. We have had a flurry of important milestones and announcements recently. So I'm happy to provide some further detail. Genentech has followed up rapidly since the release of the IMvigor010 results incorporating Signatera as a companion diagnostic for atezolizumab in a global prospective Phase III trial called IMvigor011, natural sequel. The results from the first Phase III released last fall are on the left-hand side of the page. You can see that the 37% of bladder cancer patients identified as MRD-positive by Signatera had a clear survival benefit from treatment with atezo with a hazard ratio of 0.59, while the MRD-negative patients had no benefit. In IMvigor011, which is already underway, patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be screened after surgery to 500 who are MRD positive. And those patients will be randomized to receive atezo or a placebo. If successful, Natera would seek FDA approval for Signatera as a continued diagnostic to atezolizumab for this intended use. This is the first of many registrational trials for Signatera as the IMvigor010 data has been recognized as a major proof of concept with application across cancer types. Okay. Now I'd like to cover the preliminary data set that we are releasing today in colorectal cancer. As Steve described, this is the first of many data readouts we expect from the large prospective CIRCULATE-IDEA trial that is running now in Japan with plans to expand to the U.S. and Europe. As we've described in the past, this trial is led by the National Cancer Center East in Japan, with over 150 clinical sites actively enrolling across the country. And the primary goal of which is to definitively assess whether stage III colorectal cancer patients who test MRD-negative with Signatera can be safely deescalated from chemotherapy. Slide has the key headlines. Based on the interim analysis, Signatera showed a presurgical sensitivity of 94%, which is even better than the 89% published in our validation paper with Reinert et. al in 2019. This also compares favorably to the 47% sensitivity reported recently by Parikh et. al, using a competing MRD test called Reveal, which is not tumor informed. The presurgical sensitivity ought to be very high in colorectal cancer, near 100%, given that patients have the cancer in their body, they have not had any prior systemic therapy and CRC is known as a tumor type with a high rate of ctDNA shed. This is a metric that can be compared relatively easily across different tests. Furthermore, out of 31 recurrence events thus far recorded in the study, Signatera has detected 29 out of 31 or 93.5% in longitudinal testing, which again is better than the 88% we published in Reinert et. al, and again, compares favorably to the 69% longitudinal sensitivity reported by Parikh, et. al. We are pleased to see that our performance metrics are improving in the prospective setting, given all the technical improvements we've implemented since our launch in 2019. Finally, we're seeing a sample failure rate in this study of less than 3%, including both tissue and plasma, which compares very favorably to the double-digit failure rate in plasma alone reported by Parikh, et. al. As we've seen from our experience in NIPT, these rates of success and failure have a significant impact on clinical utility and adoption. Data from a subset of this group will be presented in a few weeks at ASCO, and we look forward to continuing our momentum in Japan over the coming months and years. This next slide provides a more comprehensive comparison between the performance data available with Signatera versus the data reported on the Reveal test. Drawing on the breadth and depth of evidence behind Signatera, specifically in CRC and across other solid tumors, we believe the science is clear that personalized and tumor-informed MRD testing is the way to go. In addition to the sensitivity advantages that I described a moment ago in both the presurgical and postsurgical settings, I want to highlight the significant difference in diagnostic lead time with these two different products. Using serial longitudinal testing, Reinert et. al reported that Signatera detected residual disease on average 8.7 months ahead of radiographic recurrence, whereas by our estimate, Parikh et. al observed a lead time of approximately four months. We believe the more sensitive and useful test is the one that will pick up the cancer recurrence earlier before it becomes radiographically or clinically apparent. Beyond that, there are a number of other clinical advantages with Signatera. One important one is the ability to quantitate the ctDNA level. In addition to reporting presence or absence of tumor DNA, Signatera also provides a quantitative metric that allows physicians to track tumor growth and dynamics over time. We already know that this is critical for treatment monitoring, which led to the draft LCD for Medicare in immunotherapy monitoring, but we will soon report new data at ASCO with our collaborators from Aarhus University showing how this quantitative signal can also be clinically useful during recurrence monitoring in CRC. By comparison, the Reveal test, which relies on a black box combination of genomic and epigenomic signatures, does not quantitate. As a reminder, Signatera is being ordered clinically now by hundreds of physicians, not only in CRC, but across many different cancer types. To that point, the next slide covers a couple of major new indications where we are producing positive data. On the left is the data we released at AACR in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal malignancy, with an average five-year survival rate of only 47%. Right now, a serum-based biomarker called CA125 is commonly used for recurrence detection, but it lacks sensitivity and specificity, similar to CEA in colorectal cancer. In the study we presented at AACR, patients were tested with Signatera before surgery and then a smaller set were tested serially after surgery. We reported that 100% of the patients who cleared their tumor DNA with surgery and treatment remained relapse-free, while 100% of the patients who stayed ctDNA positive after surgery went on to relapse. Signatera provided an average diagnostic lead time of about 10 months. We are also very excited about the data to be presented at ASCO in multiple myeloma. The annual incidence of this disease is about 35,000, and there are approximately 150,000 people in the U.S. living with a prior diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Most of these patients go into remission after initial treatment, but then they are actively monitored for many years, often for the rest of their lives. The big clinical opportunity here is to provide accurate monitoring and MRD assessment using serial blood sampling, instead of requiring serial bone marrow specimens like the current labs do. The data coming up at ASCO will be a first look at what the performance could look like in blood using Signatera. Our plan in both of these indications is to continue building our data sets to pursue reimbursement from payers, including Medicare, and to enable prospective trials in partnership with pharma companies. We believe these new indications expand our addressable market opportunity to approximately 3 million tests per year in the U.S., and that does not even begin to address the global opportunity, which is real considering our momentum in Japan, a partnership with BGI in China and our clinical development activities in Europe. We are also very pleased with the progress in our Foundation Medicine partnership, and we look forward to providing additional updates on this throughout the year. With our strong commercial channel in the U.S. calling on community and academic oncologists, we look forward to expanding access to Signatera for more and more patients over time. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Yes, I think one other part of the question was related to the CIRCULATE-IDEA trial data. So we're very pleased with the interim results we're seeing from that trial. It is the largest perspective MRD trial of its kind. And it's enrolling very well. There's a lot of excitement on the physician and patient side to be a part of this and the data is looking even better than what we had published previously. So yes, we think this is an important validation of what we've seen before and it sets us up to only improve the adoption of the test, not only in clinical use, but also in other clinical trials because it's such a good feasibility demonstration of how this can work in a clinical trial. So we're very optimistic. And we look forward to presenting additional data at ASCO in a few weeks. Yes. Thank you for your question. Without being able to present the data itself at this time, it will be shown in detail at ASCO. Yes, the general concept here is just like \u2013 it's the same Signatera product. So we start with a sample of the tumor, which in this case comes from the bone marrow biopsy for that initial analysis and personalized assay design. And once that's done, we just analyze the plasma going forward serially. And that is \u2013 presents a massive opportunity to improve the clinical utility and accessibility of MRD and monitoring for the 35,000 multiple myeloma patients per year and the 150,000, that have had a prior diagnosis because those patients today without Signatera require serial bone marrow biopsies in order to continue their monitoring, and that's a painful procedure, that's a very expensive procedure and frankly patients simply avoid it because of those hurdles in it. So with Signatera, we think if we can consistently show a similar performance that's clinically sufficient, then not only will people switch over to using Signatera in this setting, but we think the overall use of monitoring and MRD testing will just go up because of the improved accessibility. Thanks, Steve. I agree with everything that was said. Of course, we've learned a ton about how people want to use this test and where they find it to be useful and to inform treatment. I think one of the interesting things that we've seen in addition to what Steve described is that a lot of the time we've \u2013 there are already patients who are somewhere midstream in their course of care. And many, many of our tests get ordered for patients for the first time who are six, 12, 18, 24 months out of surgery because they had some indeterminate scan. Some nodules showed up, something that was suspicious, but it's hard to assess for the physician. And more and more people are coming to us to help them triage a borderline situation, whether it's do I treat or not? Or in this case, do I perform a biopsy on this module that's indeterminate or not? How do I proceed? And once people see data come back and they start to grow comfortable with what the test can do, the adoption just increases significantly. And the other thing I'll say that Steve mentioned, but we've been very impressed to see how sticky the product is once a patient is on it, the repeat use and the frequency is frankly above our expectations. And it matches what it should be, frankly, because it's just such an informative test over time. So I'm sure there's more I could say there, but I'll stop at that point. Sure. I think it's hard to speak in generalities. So of course, there are going to be \u2013 yes, there's going to be technical matters we have to sort through along the way with all different types of either new indications or new specimen types or other biological variations that we're going to learn more about. But just speaking to the facts here, we're going to present great data in multiple myeloma. And I think there's a real opportunity to help a lot of patients here."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let's get into the unit and financial highlights. As you can see from the press release, we had an exceptional quarter. We processed 348,000 tests in Q1, which is 18% growth over our record Q4 performance and 47% year-on-year growth. As our base of business has grown substantially, our growth rates have still continued to accelerate. That acceleration is being driven by continued strong growth in the women's health business, but also we are seeing some real benefit from oncology and organ health as well. Revenues were $152 million in the quarter, which included a $28 million acceleration of revenue recognition from our deal with QIAGEN, which wound down in Q1. Net revenue is a non-cash accounting benefit as we will explain later in the call, but even stripping QIAGEN out of the results revenue growth was very strong. For example, the year-on-year product revenue growth was 36%. As a result of the incredible momentum we're seeing in the business, I'm pleased to significantly raise our guidance for the year by $50 million. We are now targeting $550 million to $575 million, which represents a complete reset of the range. I'll give you some of the key highlights on those trends now before giving more detail later in the call. First, we're very pleased to launch our new Panorama AI algorithm for broad use in our lab during Q1. We built a new algorithm using data for more than 2 million cell-free DNA tests and we validated the performance as part of our SMART study, the results of which we released in February of this year. Phase I of the Panorama AI launch reduces cost of goods sold for Panorama and also cuts our no call rate in half while maintaining market-leading sensitivity, which dramatically improves our customers' experience. Moving on to organ health. We are a few quarters into the Prospera launch for kidney transplant rejection, and it's going very well. We found that there was a broad base of customers eager to adopt cell-free DNA testing, and we're continuing to innovate and push the science forward. More recently, Medicare issued new coverage guidance for donor-derived cell-free DNA testing enabling coverage beyond kidney transplants. The technology required for detecting transplant rejections in other organs such as heart or lung is essentially the same technology we use for Prospera. So it's very encouraging to see a pathway to reimbursement for these other organ types. In oncology, we're at the early stages of our Signatera clinical launch, and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our pharma business. We have a lot of exciting updates to share with you today. On our last earnings call, we reviewed the results of our groundbreaking IMvigor010 study with Genentech, which looked at using atezolizumab in adjuvant muscle-invasive bladder cancer. While the drug did not meet its primary endpoint, in the all-comers population, there was a significant treatment benefit in those patients, who were Signatera positive prior to receiving treatment. Based on these results, we were happy to move very quickly with Genentech to set up a second Phase III trial IMvigor011, which if successful could position us favorably to obtain FDA approval for Signatera as a companion diagnostic to atezolizumab in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. IMvigor011 has already started enrolling patients. These types of studies with pharmaceutical companies are all part of the data flywheel we've described in the past. Paid studies with pharma generate high quality data that can be later used for reimbursement approvals and guideline changes. The powerful IMvigor010 results have also driven additional demand with our pharma business development efforts. For example, we recently received two additional FDA breakthrough device designations for major new Signatera indications outside of colorectal cancer and we look forward to providing additional information as our pharma partners publicly disclose these trials. In addition to the expansion in bladder cancer and the new FDA Breakthrough Device Designations at AACR a few weeks ago, we presented compelling data in ovarian cancer together with our collaborators from UCSF Columbia and UPMC. Signatera significantly outperformed the standard-of-care serum-based monitoring test for ovarian cancer, CA-125 and it predicted relapse an average of 10 months before radiographic recurrence. Ovarian is an indication that's very important to us given our history in women's health and given the very high recurrence rate and low overall survival rates. We also plan to present positive early multiple myeloma data in a few weeks at ASCO. We expect Signatera to address a major unmet medical need in this cancer type. Today, MRD testing and monitoring are already the standard of care in multiple myeloma, but the problem is that existing MRD tests require a bone marrow biopsy each time the patient is monitored. Bone marrow biopsies are painful and expensive, a few thousand dollars each, so many patients avoid getting tested. After initial setup, Signatera offers the chance to monitor for recurrence with a simple blood sample and without the added costs of the additional bone marrow biopsy that's required for ongoing monitoring with other MRD tests. I'm also pleased for the first time to publicly announce an interim readout from the international prospective CIRCULATE-IDEA trial, which has already enrolled its first 1500 CRC patients. As we described in the past, CIRCULATE is a landmark prospective trial designed to be process changing in early-stage CRC. In the interim readout, Signatera delivered longitudinal sensitivity to relapse of greater than 93%, which compares favorably to the 69% longitudinal sensitivity recently published by a tumor nai\u0308ve competitor. Data on the first 400 patients from the trial will also be presented in June at ASCO. So clearly our momentum continues as we build upon our leadership position in each of these business areas. Okay. Now let me move on to the business trends. The next slide is our volume progression over time, where the Q1 in each year is highlighted in green. Those of you that have followed the company know we get some seasonal benefit in NIPT volumes during Q1, but the increase we saw in Q1 this year was significant. You can visually see the acceleration of the business in the last few quarters compared to historical trends. We're benefiting from successful launches in our organ health and oncology businesses, which are both going very well and meeting our expectations and we're also seeing continued momentum in the women's health business. NIPT's sequential quarterly growth rates accelerated once again in Q1 and carrier screening tests also increased proportionally. These trends were fueled by very strong new account wins and account retention trends that were even higher than our historical averages. I also think we're starting to see the first signs of broad average risk market penetration that we've been waiting on for a long time, more on that in a moment. The next slide shows the revenue trajectory continuing on pace as well. Obviously, Q1 is a bit of an outlier given the QIAGEN revenue recognition of $28 million. Some of you will recall, we collected a large upfront cash payment from QIAGEN in return for our commitment to offer clinical content for their sequencing program, which they subsequently wound down. Most of that cash was non-refundable, so now that the deal has been formally ended, we have now recognized the remaining cash on our books as revenue for the work we performed. If you focus beyond that one-time event, however, you'll see we significantly exceeded revenue expectations in Q1 with a roughly $124 million organic quarter and a 36% product revenue growth. Mike will spend more time on this later in the call, but we were cautious in our revenue accrual, given we just recently received a lot of reimbursement decisions in our favor. The outlook for ASPs throughout the course of the year looks positive. One of the reasons we can maintain our leadership in NIPT is that we continue to invest in new improvements in the technology. The Pano AI Phase I launch is the most recent example. We showed in the SMART trial that this new algorithm boosted our PPV for microdeletions to 53%, which is significantly better than what others have published. Any in core aneuploidy testing, Pano AI Phase I achieved a 50% reduction in NIPT no-call rates while maintaining our market-leading sensitivity and specificity. This allows us to more efficiently meet the rapidly growing demand for Panorama and is yet another positive talking point for the sales team. We are not finished with improvements to Panorama, and I look forward to sharing additional phases of Panorama AI with you later this year. As you can see on the next slide, we're thinking we're well positioned to take advantage of the NIPT market expanding in the wake of the ACOG and SMFM practice bulletins posted last fall. The continued account wins make sense because we've got exciting new talking points with the launch of Pano AI, and we're seeing upside from the presentation of the SMART trial data earlier this year at SMFM. We're uniquely leveraging the power of SNPs to deliver best-in-class performance and differentiated clinical value. We've now studied more than 1.3 million patients in over 23 peer-reviewed publications. Now with the completion of the SMART trial, we have the validation data for the largest and most rigorous study aneuploidy and microdeletion testing. Combine that with our seasoned clinical and commercial teams, and we're well positioned for the increase in NIPT adoption that we expect to see over the next several years. Okay. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our recent progress in organ health. We've been pleased with the progress of our launch, which is in line with our expectations. In addition to growing commercial volume, one of our goals has been to push the science forward in a meaningful way, and we've made great progress. For example, we've recently developed a method to routinely check the background cell-free DNA in each sample and now we inform physicians when we see exceptionally high background cell-free DNA, which can potentially mask transplant rejections. The first example of this technology was just published in Transplant Direct, showing the impact of COVID-19 on background cell-free DNA levels. It turns out that COVID-19 causes background cell-free DNA levels to spike dramatically, which can potentially mask rejection if you're only looking at the donor-derived cell-free DNA percentage. This example in COVID-19 is important, but we believe it's not the only use case for Natera's technology. There are many factors that cause an increase in background cell-free DNA. And we think, ultimately, it's going to be important to be able to flag the patients where this is occurring. On the next slide, we were thrilled with the recent local coverage decision from Medicare, which we think could open up a pathway to reimbursement for Prospera in a range of organ transplant settings beyond just kidney. There's no reason why our technology shouldn't work very well in other organ types. And we are, of course, pleased to see one of the major hurdles, reimbursement, essentially removed from the equation as we evaluate these other additional expansion opportunities. With that, let me hand the call over to Solomon to give some more detail on our efforts in oncology. Solomon? Yes. Thanks for the question. So I would say, at a very high level we think we stack up very, very well to the tumor naive approaches that are out there. And to the other tumor informed approaches that are out there, frankly. I mean, when you look at the breadth of data and the performance, we have a very significant lead and a great position compared to the other groups that are coming into this space. So we're doing well. We're on market. The volume is growing. The launch is successful. I feel like we're in a very strong position. As far as building personalized approaches off of liquid exome, I think that that's something that we have the capability to do and it's something that we're considering, but we don't feel like it's required at this point, just given the success that we're seeing. Solomon, would you like to add any additional points? Yes, so I'll comment on the ramp. I mean, we haven't broken out our Signatera numbers or Prospera numbers specifically, but you can see our volume growth is going very well. And that includes what we believe is a very successful launch for Signatera and our other products. So, it's in line with our expectations. We're seeing good adoption. The test is working very well. And so we're pleased with the trajectory. I think on the question of multiple myeloma, so currently to run the monitoring assays that are available, you have to do repeat bone marrow biopsies in order to do that ongoing monitoring. So with the test that we're working on, you do one bone marrow biopsy for the set-up, and then all the ongoing draws are just blood draws. So there is no need for a repeat bone marrow biopsy. Yes, are you talking about early cancer screening? Yes. So we've said actually recently I think on our last call that we do have a program in that space and that's an area that we're moving into. We're actually making progress. We didn't announce anything today, but the program is underway. We think we have a very efficient approach to go after that market, both technically and from a validation and commercialization standpoint. And we will be providing updates in the future, but we're not going to be providing any today. Yes. Mike, maybe I'll comment on volumes and then if you want to follow-on on ASPs... From a volume standpoint, I think we are starting to see the long-awaited shift over towards average risk. And when we look at the growth in Q1, it's really coming from two factors. So, one is new wins from competitive takeaways. So we had our best quarter ever for growth coming from new customers and competitive takeaways. And the second thing that we're seeing is a shift towards average risk. So when we look at the mix of volume coming in this high risk versus average risk, we're starting to really see that needle move for a long time, for years it was very steady. And over the last six months, we've seen kind of a linear ramp up. And so, we think the markets moving now toward a place where it's \u2013 maybe it was 20% penetrated on average risk before, I think we're starting to get up into the 30% average risk penetration. So there is a long way to go. We're at the very early stages, but it's happening. And we're doing well both in absorbing that penetration, but also winning new customers and taking business away from others. Mike, want to comment on ASPs? Yes, so I'll make some comments and then Solomon you can jump in. So, in general, the feedback has been very positive. I mean, if you go back four years ago, when we first started talking about this, nobody was talking about solid tumor MRD, or MRD testing in the adjuvant setting. And now if you're an oncology diagnostic company, you have to have an MRD product. Everybody is trying to move into this space. And that's really a validation of the enormous market opportunity. When you look at colorectal alone, there is a million tests that could be done per year. So these market sizes that we're talking about here are orders of magnitude bigger than anything else in the specialty diagnostics space and certainly much, much bigger than the therapy selection market alone where traditionally a lot of the energies have been focused. So we're really happy about how things are going. We're seeing the use from doctors accelerate. We're seeing lots of repeat use from patients and doctors. We're seeing use in all different stages of colorectal. We're seeing use beyond colorectal. We're getting a lot of great patient stories and great physician stories about how the test worked as advertised and how it helped your patients. So we're pleased with how things are going. Solomon, do you want to jump in on that? Yes. So one of the reasons, if you look back at Natera's history, we were the fourth company into the NIPT space, but today, we're the market leader by far. We have the most clinical differentiation. We have the most peer-reviewed published data, and we're doing the most volume. And the reason is because our test is unique and differentiated and physicians like it. So we're the only company out of all the other companies that are out there that are looking at SNPs. And when you use SNPs, you're able to identify things that simply biologically can't be identified by the other companies, things like triploidy, for example, that are very relevant in pregnancy. But it also allows us to get higher sensitivity and specificity on things like trisomy 21 and [indiscernible] chromosomes. When you shift over to something like 22q microdeletion disorder, and you look at the performance using SNPs there versus the shotgun sequencing method, I mean, it's really night and day, the difference in the performance. I mean we're talking about sensitivity in the 90s versus others that have published performance sensitivity in the 20s. So the technique works exceptionally well, and that's now being shown out in the volumes. On the microdeletion standpoint, we now have published \u2013 or have presented and intend to be published the largest prospective trial that has ever been done in the microdeletion space. The results look exceptional. There were two key findings on microdeletions. One is that the 22q disease is much more common than what was previously expected at approximately one in 1,500. The \u2013 and the second was that our test works really, really well. So the sensitivity was very high. And the positive predictive value was also very high. And those are two of the \u2013 I guess, combined those are the three things, disease incidence, sensitivity, specificity that societies look at when they are deciding whether or not something meets the criteria to be approved for a prenatal screening test. So we think we're in a good position to, at some point in the future, get into the guidelines and receive payer coverage. And we're doing hundreds of thousands of these tests already every year that are not reimbursed. So as soon as reimbursement comes in, this is going to be an immediate, very significant impact to Natera's revenue and the bottom line. Yes. Thanks Mark. I think the initial area that we're looking at is colorectal, and I think similar to some of the others in the space. And then ideally, that would be expanding beyond CRC into just some of the other cancer types. But I would just say, wait until we provide a more significant update that will be coming. It's not something that we included in the call today, but there will be some solid updates coming in the future. Yes. I'd just say the data that we have coming out at ASCO is going to speak for itself. It's early, but you'll see when you attend the conference. We think it's very positive. Of course, there's more work to be done there, but we don't think that there's technical limitations in this particular indication. Solomon, do you want to add to that? Yes. Thank you. So we are pleased with how the launch is going. We have been out there now a handful of quarters, and things are in line with our expectations. We think we have a unique technology that competes very well in the areas that matter. I think that the paper that we showed here in the earnings deck, I think, highlights one important factor where we've already, in a very short period of time, completely moved the science forward. This issue of background cell-free DNA is very important. If you're looking at a metric donor-derived cell-free DNA percentage, but the background cell-free DNA is very, very high, you can mask rejection, and you can have a false negative result. And so we are now incorporating that and flagging cases where there's a very high background cell-free DNA. And that was what was covered in this paper with UCLA that looked at this COVID case study. Yes, so we are doing well. The community nephrology space, I think there's an opportunity, and that's something where we are seeing some volume come in. But certainly, I think the transplant centers are the larger opportunity in the near-term. When you look at expansion into other organs, we are \u2013 we sort of accessing what opportunities are out there for us, but there is no reason why or technology should not work very, very well and heart, lung and other indications and now there the reimbursement hurdle has been cleared, it's certainly makes it a more attractive opportunity for us. If you look at some of our competitors and the volumes they are presenting in some of these other areas like heart, it's compelling. And we know our technology works well. We know we can get reimbursed very easily now with this new imbursement guideline, and so it's something we're assessing. And we're going to have to consider whether it makes sense for us. Yes. So we've been able to grow the business with some incremental increases in operating expenses that we've kind of layered in over time. So I think we're in a good position right now as far as our kind of reach and frequency on the women's health team. Of course, we're always monitoring and sort of and sort of looking at things, but I don't think that there is any \u2013 any big changes at this point that we would anticipate. When you look at the path towards profitability and towards cash flow breakeven, I mean that path at point is very clear, the women's health side. I mean we're seeing \u2013 so with this Pano AI launch that we announced the Phase I implementation and then the remaining phases in the year, this is a big COGS savings on NIPT. We haven't talked about that in a long time, but our COGS on NIPT now are well below $200 per test. I well below because of the scale that we're operating at, because of things like Pano AI, where we're now incorporating where we are incorporating deep neural networks and machine learning from over 2 million tests that we run in our lab and we are using that to reduce the costs of the workflow and of the reagents that we put into the assay. So major COGS reductions that are hitting and I think that cap to cash flow breakeven is very clear. We're always looking out for incremental investments, but I think we're in a good position right now in women's health. Yes, it's definitely happening. We've seen over the past six months a linear shift in the percentage of our business that is average risk versus high risk. So that's definitely happening. It's going to continue. We think that the endpoint for this is going to be around 90% penetration, 95% penetration. And we think we can get there in three, four years something in that range. Maybe even less. Right now I think the market is 30% penetrated, so there is a long way to go. I mean NIPT growth is just really starting to ramp right down. We're just at the very beginning, and we are positioned and we are in a incredible position. We have a great sales team. They're tenured. We have the most data. We have the best performing product on the market. So we're in great position to ride the wave of expansion in average risk NIPT. Yes. So when you look at a lot of the historical cancer diagnostic launches, the companies that have been very successful Foundation Medicine or Genomic Health, you go back and what you see is in the first year, sort of a lower single digit penetration in the second year kind of a mid-single digit penetration into the market. And then the third year, maybe high single digit, low-double digit penetration. And that sort of what we use to kind of draft our forecast and I think its inline with other specialty diagnostics that are out there now. The data coming out, I mean we are putting so much really compelling data out, I mean it's almost every month, there is a massive announcement coming out of every conference we are now having multiple presentation. I think things could really start to accelerate, but that's kind of what we set out as the benchmark for success just from a historical perspective, and we are pleased \u2013 very pleased with where we are right now in the launch."

Please go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter of 2022. On the line, I'm joined by Steve Chapman, our CEO; Solomon Moshkevich, General Manager of Oncology; and John Fesko, Chief Business Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of this call will also be available at investor.natera.com. Starting on Slide 2. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance such as our operational and financial outlook and projections, our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various current and future products, including product capabilities, expected for lease dates, reimbursed leverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, February 28, 2023. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteven Chapman : Thanks, Mike. We had a great year in 2022, both in terms of commercial execution and achieving key milestones. We processed 2.1 million tests, which is year-on-year growth of 32%. Revenues were $820.2 million for the full year, $40 million higher than the midpoint of our initial 2022 guidance, up 31% from 2021 and up 37% when excluding the onetime QIAGEN revenue. Business momentum continue in Q4 with volume growth of 28% and product revenue growth of 28% year-over-year, even off a bigger base and with a difficult year-over-year growth comparison after a very strong Q4 2021. We performed 196,000 oncology tests in 2022, representing growth of 158% with 64,000 tests performed in Q4. This demonstrates continued strong sequential growth of 21% or an increase of 11,000 units versus Q3 of 2022. We estimate that now more than 30% of oncologists in the United States are ordering Signatera. We've achieved several key milestones even since our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this year. First, we were very pleased to see our prospective multisite CIRCULATE study was published in January on the cover of Nature Medicine, which gives you some sense of excitement that the data is generating in the field. Consistent with our earlier publications in both colorectal cancer and other tumor types, the data showed strong, predictive and prognostic value of Signatera 18 months out post-surgery. Solomon will dive deeper into these topics later in the call. Second, we received confirmation from MolDx that Signatera had met coverage requirements for adjuvant and recurrence monitoring in patients with Stage IIb or higher breast cancer across all subtypes. We estimate that Stage IIb in higher population could represent roughly 1 million tests per year, and breast cancer patients already account for a growing portion of our Signatera volume. In addition to the current coverage, we've got a pipeline of data designed to further highlight Signatera's utility and expand coverage in breast cancer. In fact, we expect to publish 2 large-scale breast cancer studies this year, each with approximately 1,000 plasma samples. In women's health, we were very encouraged to see the American College of Medical Genetics issue updated guidance to include a recommendation that all pregnant individuals be offered screening for 22q deletion syndrome. ACMG's guideline referenced the strong 22q performance results achieved in the SMART study, and we hope to see action by other medical societies later this year as they digest and incorporate the findings of that study. We were also pleased to see another guideline adoption for expanded carrier screening as the National Society of Genetic Counselors recently offered a very strong endorsement. We will get into this in more detail later in the call. In Oregon Health, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation issued new guidelines recognizing the value of donor-derived cell-free DNA with a Class 1 Level B recommendation. We continue to work towards Medicare coverage for our Prospera heart test. In addition to heart, we eagerly await the publication of our perspective real-world RenaCARE study, which evaluated Renasight in chronic kidney disease patients. We expect that study to publish in the first half of this year. Moving to 2023 guidance. We are setting our initial 2023 revenue guidance in a range of $980 million to $1 billion. We expect to generate this continued top line momentum even as we reduce operating expenses from 2022 level and dramatically reduce our cash burn. I'm really pleased to inform everyone that we will be guiding to a cash burn reduction of roughly $150 million compared to 2022, and we are reiterating our path to hitting a cash flow breakeven quarter in 2024. As we mentioned previously, we've included about $5 million of annual expense all in for early cancer detection in our budget. This doesn't include the cost of a new PMA level prospective study, which we estimate would be about $30 million over 2 years, if required. As we said before, we're awaiting the results of our proof-of-concept study and further feedback from the FDA on the [indiscernible] trial. Once we have the results and feedback in hand, we can then decide whether it's necessary to pull the trigger on a stepped-up level of investment. It goes without saying we wouldn't do that without having very favorable results from the proof-of-concept study. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the appointment of Ruth Williams-Brinkley to our Board of Directors. Ruth is a seasoned health care executive with 3 decades of industry experience. She currently serves as President of Kaiser Permanente Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic states, where she oversees regional operations. She also held leadership roles at large health systems earlier in her career. We are thrilled to welcome Ruth to the Board, and we look forward to working with her. Okay. Great. Let's get into more details on the next slide. In 2022, we processed approximately 2.1 million tests, a 32% increase over a very strong 2021 growth year. This represents strong traction across the businesses, and I think we are well positioned for continued growth. I'm going to start off talking about women's health. Today, we estimate that roughly half of the eligible patients in the United States are getting an NIPT. While that underlying market continues to grow, we've continued to consolidate market share. As we've also discussed, guideline adoption for 22q and expanded carrier screening are additional opportunities to further expand access and help more patients. And we are pleased to see recent traction in both areas. Let me turn it over to John, our Chief Business Officer, to discuss some of the latest updates on these topics. John?\nA - John Fesko: Thanks, Steve. In December, the American College of Medical Genetics published a practice guideline that recommended offering noninvasive prenatal screening of 22q deletion syndrome to all patients. The guideline specifically referenced the SNP-based screening method Natera developed and profiled in our 20,000-patient SMART study, which published last year in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 22q deletion syndrome is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans, affecting about 1 in 15 live births. It's more common than other genetic conditions recommended for routine screening such as trisomy 18, trisomy 13, cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. 22q deletion syndrome is a leading cause of congenital heart defects, palate issues, immunodeficiencies, endocrine dysfunction and neurological issues. Patients born with 22q deletion syndrome may be very challenging to diagnose with a median age of diagnosis at 4.7 years after seeing on average 7 different clinical specialties prior to molecular diagnosis. Treatment with calcium from birth can prevent seizures and brain damage caused by hypocalcemia. In our SMART study, we saw 83% sensitivity in a 0.05% false positive rate, resulting in a very high positive predictive value of 53%. We're excited about the momentum created by the publication of SMART and ACMG's new recommendation that all patients be offered 22q dilution screening. We believe that 22q deletion screening will be a significant differentiator for Natera. Because Natera runs targeted sequencing of SNPs and we can differentiate maternal from fetal DNA, we can cost effectively sequence at a much deeper level across the 22q region versus labs simply doing massively parallel signature sequencing. These differences contribute to our high sensitivity, specificity and PPV. Additionally, today, most labs only touched for 22q deletions above 2.5 megabases. This is a major limitation because 41% of high-risk 22q results in our SMART study were below 2.5 megabases. Natera is not limited in this way. Finally, we've created a significant competitive lead with our published data. To our knowledge, Natera is the only lab who's published a multisite prospective study of 22q screening with genetic confirmation in the majority of subjects. The SMART study took 7 years to complete and published and will likely never be done again. To our knowledge, there are no other prospective trials ongoing, in which cases data lead will persist for a long time. We think these significant performance differences will be important to physicians, especially given there is no guideline recommending 22q be offered to all pregnant women. We believe physicians will place more value on 22q performance going forward. These differentiators may also be important for health plans as we start to see coverage come into place as we believe will happen. It's possible that payers will limit their coverage to only those 22q tests that have been validated to its [expense]. Beyond NIPT, we're also seeing guidelines change for expanded carrier screening. Earlier this month, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guidelines to recommend expanded carrier screening being made available to all individuals considering a reproduction. This follows a recommendation from ACMG in 2021 that expanded carrier screening should be offered to all pregnant patients. We're also seeing these guideline changes lead to medical policy changes at health plans. In fact, just this month, one large benefit manager that covers 15% of commercial covered lives with a new policy that supports the use of expanded carrier screening. There is still work to be done here, but the fact that we are now seeing progress is important. Okay. I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss organ health. Steve?\nSteven Chapman : Great. Thanks, John. Our initiatives in organ health are going well. We continue to benefit from the publication of the large-scale multisite prospective Trifecta study in kidney transplant, which came out last fall. The result of that trial were excellent and appear to have been well received by the community. In heart transplant, we are excited for the readout of the independent academically led DTRT study. In DTRT, investigators tested greater than 450 plasma samples from greater than 150 heart transplant recipients across 7 top academic sites with biopsy match samples and clinical follow-up of up to 3.5 years. We believe this is one of the most significant trials to date in the field, and we look forward to the results being published soon. Our momentum in heart is timely because ISHLT, the main governing body, just updated its guidelines to include donor-derived cell-free DNA testing for surveillance in heart transplant recipients. I also mentioned Renasight at the top of the call. As a reminder, Renasight is our genetic test for patients that have been previously diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. The test can determine whether they may have a genetic cause of their chronic kidney disease. We think there are more than 1 million newly diagnosed patients per year and about 37 million patients living with chronic kidney disease. With more than 10% of the population in the United States having CKD and being eligible for testing, we think this is one of the largest areas of health care that can be improved with genetic testing. 3 years ago, we worked with the world's leading investigators from Columbia, Yale, UPenn, UPMC, NYU, Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, among others, to design the definitive RenaCARE study. We completed enrollment in RenaCARE in August, having enrolled more than 1,600 patients from over 30 centers. The study is designed to assess how Renasight's genetic findings may impact the clinical management of patient care. As the results readout, it's important to put them in context. I think hereditary cancer is an instructive comparison. In a large study of nearly 3,000 cancer patients published in JAMA Oncology, 13.3% of patients had a pathogenic germline variant indicating hereditary cancer. And of those patients with a high variant, 28.2% had resulting treatment modifications. As RenaCARE read out, we will be looking at the same metrics, what fraction of the study participants have a pathogenic variant associated with their CKD and what fraction of the positive patients treatment was modified after the pathogenic variant was discovered with the Renasight panel. We think the RenaCARE study could position us for guideline inclusion in the future. This is a very large opportunity, and we already have a distribution channel in place through our existing nephrology call point. Stay tuned for more updates on this important opportunity. With that, I will now turn it over to Solomon to review our oncology results in more detail. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich : Thanks, Steve. In the past few months, we made great progress in oncology. The big stories today are volume growth, colorectal data publication and Medicare coverage in breast cancer. We've observed excellent volume growth and adoption since our launch in 2019. At the end of Q3, we had communicated our expectation to deliver more than 185,000 units in 2022. And as you can see, we've exceeded expectations with 196,000. This growth is driven by new patients by follow-on tests for existing patients and by new ordering providers. Steve mentioned that more than 30% of oncologists in the U.S. are now ordering Signatera. When combined with strong volume growth, I think this shows that Signatera is rapidly becoming part of the standard of care in the United States, helping many patients gain reassurance when their testing is back negative or to get an early chance at intervention when the test is positive. In terms of volume mix, the way to think about it is that roughly 60% to 65% of the volume is from colorectal, bladder and immunotherapy monitoring. And now adding breast cancer to that list makes about 80%. As a reminder, our reimbursement today is largely driven by Medicare, and we are making progress with commercial plans as well. We've gotten to this point because of our core technology and the magnitude of the clinical unmet need, but also because we've been able to scale the lab and build an industry-leading medical and commercial team with reimbursement momentum and advanced diagnostic lab test status based on strong evidence of clinical validity and utility across disease types. We believe Natera benefits from an important first-mover advantage in the MRD field. We think a Signatera patient with an existing personalized assay is unlikely to switch to another MRD test. That has a ripple effect. Since our ordering providers will usually have a cohort of existing Signatera patients who are doing ongoing monitoring with regular blood draws, it makes it more challenging to bring another MRD lab into the physician's practice, which creates a unique competitive advantage unseen in the clinical lab industry. Another significant competitive advantage is in data generation, where we started working back in 2015. We now have roughly 40 peer-reviewed Signatera publications across more than 2 dozen cancer types. I think the fact that we've been able to generate consistently excellent results across tumor types gives us confidence in the eventual pan cancer adoption and reimbursement for Signatera. Let's turn now to our progress in colorectal cancer. In mid-January, we announced the publication of our CIRCULATE study in the journal Nature Medicine, featuring 18 months of clinical follow-up across over 1,000 patients. The study demonstrated strong performance for Signatera with a presurgical detection rate of 95.9% in Stage II and III colorectal patients. In addition, we showed the strong predictive benefits of Signatera in CRC, where Signatera positive patients benefited significantly from adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas Signatera negative patients did not. We think this has significant implications for CRC patients, many of whom today do not get the chemotherapy they need or others who may be treated unnecessarily. The key distinction here is the prospective nature of the study with physicians and patients receiving results in real time and also the predictive element, which takes the evidence beyond sensitivity and specificity into improved outcomes. This raises the evidence bar for the whole field, and it strengthens the utility of Signatera in colorectal cancer. We expect that it will help us reach the next level in physician adoption as well as influencing the NCCN Guidelines Committee. We are still anticipating an updated NCCN guideline in the near future since it has not yet been published from the annual committee meeting in August of 2022. Given the timing of our publication this January, we do not know if the evidence will have been incorporated by the NCCN committee in this round. In that case, we expect it would be considered in the next round. Also, the CIRCULATE trial is ongoing with future readouts expected to strengthen the evidence further, including from the 2 randomized arms, Altera and VEGA. To step back for a minute, our journey in colorectal cancer creates a replicable road map for Signatera adoption in new indications. First, the biobank cohort that confirmed clinical validity and enabled Medicare coverage and initial adoption then the prospective trials, partnered either with pharma or academic consortia that drive more definitive evidence with an aim to change guidelines. We plan to repeat that journey in bladder cancer, immunotherapy monitoring and breast cancer. The MolDx decision to cover Signatera in breast cancer is the latest example of this model at work. Signatera was approved for coverage in advanced breast cancer patients for both adjuvant and recurrence monitoring across all disease types. Given the number of people suffering from breast cancer in the U.S., we view Medicare coverage as a critical milestone. Looking at the addressable market, there are approximately 290,000 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients every year with approximately 25% to 30% of these patients with resectable Stage IIb and higher. For this patient population, we estimate an addressable market of approximately 1 million tests, and we see potential opportunities to expand our coverage in the future into the neoadjuvant setting and earlier stages of disease. Steve mentioned that a meaningful chunk of our existing Signatera clinical volumes, approximately 15%, are already coming from breast cancer patients. This is an early sign of the strong demand from patients and physicians to inform difficult treatment decisions and better monitor their disease. Many of our strongest testimonials come from patients with breast cancer, including one that was featured on Good Morning America. The breast cancer community is highly organized and self-empowered, making this an indication where we see patients voting with their feet. We're looking forward to growing rapidly in breast cancer as we expand our commercial effort and deliver more data from our clinical pipeline. This coverage decision expands our reimbursed addressable market to approximately 3.5 million tests per year. In 2023, we will be focusing our team on growth in CRC and breast cancer as well as bladder cancer and immunotherapy monitoring, publishing new evidence and translating it into expanded coverage and adoption. Our clinical data pipeline remains strong with this slide showing some key highlights. During Q4, we continued our progress with peer-reviewed publications in gastroesophageal and anal cancers, along with the key publication of our CIRCULATE study. We also had a good data set in melanoma that was accepted for publication. And at key medical conferences, we presented new data in colon, esophagogastric, anal and neoadjuvant breast cancer. At the same time, we remain focused on our Phase III studies and our CDX partnerships in colorectal, bladder and breast cancers, shown on the right side of the page here with more to come. Now I'd like to hand it over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Great. Thanks, Solomon. The next slide just summarizes our 2022 performance and financials. Steve covered the revenue and growth rates, and we feel like we are in a great position to continue driving growth, given our leadership position in several large and underpenetrated areas of care. I would just note that the growth comparison versus 2021 is a little skewed against us because you'll recall in 2021, we had the onetime revenue recognition of close to $29 million from the wind down of our QIAGEN partnership that Steve alluded to. That also affects the comparison on gross margins, which were a little elevated in 2021 with QIAGEN and other revenue true-ups. And of course, we've described how headwinds in germline ASPs, the California P&S program and growth in Signatera clinical volumes would temporarily pressure margins as we sought to expand reimbursement. Operating expenses landed in line with our original guide from this time last year, and our ending cash balance is in line with our expectations. Okay. Let's get into the guide. As Steve mentioned, we are guiding $980 million to $1 billion in revenue for 2023. This will require us to continue to deliver strong volume growth across all of our focus areas but include some caution on advancing average selling prices. As we've described in the past, we feel like we can make meaningful progress on ASPs just through execution in women's health and the natural evolution of our volume mix for Signatera clinical volumes. And we've included modest progress on these fronts in the guide. We are also including a very modest benefit from the recent breast cancer coverage decision. And I expect we will be able to give more details on the impact of breast cancer coverage once we gain more experience with the reimbursement. In addition to those efforts, we have the 3 major guidelines that can really change our reimbursement profile with 22q and expanded carrier screening in women's health and ACCN guidelines in colorectal cancer. Consistent with our typical approach, we haven't included any potential impact from these guideline changes in our forecast just because we don't control the outcome or the timing. We are taking a similarly cautious line on gross margins. This guide essentially presumes limited progress on reimbursement and hitting our COGS projects this year. Over the longer term, guideline inclusion and continued study reimbursement execution would give us clear line of sight to gross margin in the mid-50s and beyond just as we have described in the past. Okay. On this slide, I want to spend a bit more time on OpEx and the cash burn guidance. You'll note that despite guiding to continued growth, we expect to see operating expenses to decline by roughly $45 million this year versus 2022. As Steve described, we've built strong leadership positions in each of our areas of focus that can now drive substantial future growth without continuing to increase operating expenses. Many of you will recall that we've executed this playbook once before when we pledged to get to cash flow breakeven in our women's health business by the middle of 2021. In that instance, we have spent years building a commercial channel, running large clinical trials, improving product performance while executing large COGS reduction projects and investing in a user experience platform that could scale with large volume increases. We then held our women's health-related expenses stable as the big trials concluded. While the volumes continue to pour in, we met our 2021 guideline. We've now established strong leadership positions in our newer areas of focus. And this year, we can start to demonstrate the same operating leverage. As a result, we expect our cash burn to decline by roughly $150 million this year alone. We've already demonstrated meaningful reductions in quarterly cash burn over the course of 2022 where we burned approximately $160 million in Q1 of '22, and now we're at roughly half that amount in Q4. We've also been making good progress in collecting on some of the accounts receivable generated during the rapid growth we experienced last year. I called out roughly $50 million in cash collection backlog in Q3, and we estimate we've collected about $40 million of that cash to date. DSOs also declined modestly in Q4 despite continued strong sequential revenue and volume growth. And we've put a lot of muscle behind accelerating our Signatera reimbursement processes recently. We think all this progress puts us in a good position to pursue the cash flow breakeven target we set last year. If we get good news on any of the 3 guidelines I mentioned, we fully expect to reach a cash flow breakeven quarter in mid-2024 as we've previously described. If we are delayed with those guidelines, we still think we are in a great position to hit the goal when you cost discipline. So we expect our existing cash balance will allow us to meet the current objectives ahead of us. So we are very pleased to share these results with you today. And now let me hand the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: So just a couple of quick follow-ups here, Mike, for you. Can you talk in a little bit more detail, about the Signatera breast coverage decision in terms of both the near-term impact? I know there's some chance of a look-back payment. And obviously, you've cited about 15% of your current volume that comes from breast. So just curious as to some specifics around the contribution there from Signatera perhaps in the back half of the year here. And then my second follow-up is on the gross margin trajectory, I totally understand a bunch of puts and takes here based upon the ASP recovery reproductive health and some of the other sort of noncovered indications for Signatera that you guys are making a commercial push in. But any color on the sequential trajectory on gross margins through the year would be helpful as well.\nMichael Brophy: Tejas, I appreciate the questions. I'll take the last one first. And yes, I do. I think what you've inferred in your question is right. I do expect gross margin trajectory to just improve over the course of the year for all the variables that we've discussed on the call and in the past. I mean, you have more time for reimbursement Signatera to kick in. You have more time for the mix to evolve into -- for us to continue to improve our ASPs in Signatera. And then some of the some of the other projects that we're working in the women's health channel also have more time to bear fruit as you progress through the year. So I do think that's kind of steady margin progression through the course of the year. On the breast cancer contribution, yes, look, I mean, we -- obviously, we just got the positive decision from MolDx, and we're very excited about that. And just given the short timing between getting bad news and this call, we just -- as usual, we just kind of erred on the side of caution in terms of the contribution to the guide. A couple of things that we're looking for is that we're going to need to engage with Noridian and just kind of get the details from our map on the pricing. And that will happen on the typical timeline, and that will give us more clarity on exactly how -- what the contribution can be through the quarters in the year. I would also expect that to be kind of back-end weighted. The other variable, I think, to call out there is just what can the volumes be in breast cancer. I think Steve alluded to this on the call. The breast cancer volume has come in like quite organically through our channel. And now on the heels of this coverage decision, there's a potential for us to significantly expand our reimbursed breast cancer volume. So you got to give us a chance to go and execute on that before we incorporate it in a guide. And finally, on the look back payments, I mean, I expect there to be some. Typically, these things are -- the coverage decisions end up being effective as of the submission to MolDx. So I think there'll be some look back there going back into last year. And as we have more clarity on that, we'll let you know. Let me pause there, Steve, if you have any other commentary on that question.\nSteven Chapman: No, I think you thoroughly covered things. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julia Qin with JPMorgan.\nJulia Qin: So just a follow-up on the gross margin guidance. I mean, looking at the 41% to 44% versus your mid-50% gross margin somewhere in '24, do you see any obviously, understanding that guideline is a big moving piece to that. But how much of that growth improvement is dependent on the guideline and the revenue inflection? And how much of that is kind of more within your control like the lowering sequencing costs and lab operations? And then if the guidelines do not materialize before mid-2022 -- 2024, what kind of levers or where do you see flexibility to further take down costs? And then I have a follow-up.\nSteven Chapman: Yes. Mike, let me first kind of just comment on some of these COGS projects. So we've really done a good job over the years of rallying our resources on these big cost reduction projects. And these are pretty straightforward. I mean, these have to do with versioning to the NovaSeq versus the NextSeq, for example, or expanding capacity in our -- in certain facilities. So these aren't like technically complex projects, they're really straightforward. And so I think we have pretty high confidence in hitting them. We've got a handful of like really big COGS reduction projects that I think are making up a significant chunk of what we're showing here as we move out into the future guidance. But Mike, do you want to comment a little bit on the margin progression further?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. No, I think that's a good lead-in, Steve. I mean, I think there's a lot of that margin progression that is just clearly within our control. I mean, you touched on the COGS project. I think on the ASP front, I mean we also talked in detail about the evolution that we expect to see in Signatera ASPs. Just as a reminder, we've already kind of seen a real sea change in Signatera ASPs from launch to now, which is ASPs were in the mid-400s as we started, and now they're kind of in the mid-700s. And that continue to evolve in our favor just based on mix and increasing the reimbursement we're seeing from Medicare and also expanding some commercial coverage as well. So I think those are all levers that are in our favor. And then I think the other part of this in terms of levers that we can pull, I mean, you see us pulling some of these levers right now. And that is just kind of the leverage we can get on our operating expense base. So I think this, our ability to continue to drive revenues on the current platform, I think, is simplified by the cash burn guide. And I think that in the event that guidelines are delayed, I don't think that means that they're permanently delayed. I think that means we can still get them. And we've got scope for us, I think, just to meet our goals with continuing OpEx discipline as we talked about in the prepared remarks.\nSteven Chapman: Yes. And just to be clear, we don't need those -- any of those guidelines to come in to get to that 50% margin target.\nJulia Qin: Got it. Super helpful. And then one more on the women's health side if I may. It seems like between microdeletion, ECS and MRD, microdeletion is the nearest term in terms of when we can expect guidelines. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the evidence is strongest for 22q. So the guideline and subsequent payer coverage is limited to 22q, how much ASP lift can we expect to see for your women's health volume?\nSteven Chapman: Yes, I'll take that. So 22q, I think, is really the whole ball game for [microlesion] testing. So when we actually led the coding submission to the AMA, which started, I think, in 2017, the code was growing in 2019. And today, the pricing that we have in payer contracts into CMS is for 22q. Other deletions are included, but 22q is sort of the base microdeletion that's part of that infrastructure. So the pricing from payers will be the same, whether it's 22q or whether it's a broad microdeletion. We think 22q is where most of the interest is as we go forward. And I think that's where the guidelines are going to be focused. And we've got a lot of differentiators. I mean, I know John sort of highlighted some of those, but these differentiators really make a big difference, both with physicians and we think also with payers. And I think it's going to be interesting to see how this pans out in the future. I also mentioned on expanded carrier screening. So today, we have a good guideline in place from NSGC. There's a strong guideline from ACMG. And the ACAR guideline is actually pretty strong. We think it's, in fact, supportive of expanded carrier screening. And that's one of the reasons why you're seeing payers starting to issue positive coverage policies. So we mentioned on the call that one of the lab benefit managers that covers 15% of all the commercial covered lives in the United States just last week issued a positive guideline for expanded carrier screening. And so that's new incremental upside that's not in the model. And I think as Mike mentioned, your product mix is sort of one of the reasons why you've seen the slight reduction in margin recently. Some of that comes from us making a proactive decision to take on some of the low-margin [Semaphore] business as they went out of business. And we thought that, that was a good idea to do because we knew that these guidelines were coming, and it turns out that was the right decision. Now we've seen since they went out of business and we picked up a significant chunk of that volume, we've seen this big lab benefit management company, they'll come out and say they're going to be covering expanded carrier screening. We've seen the NSGC guidelines come out. So I think that was the right decision is sort of temporarily take on a larger book of expanded carrier screening volume, have a slight reduction in the overall margin, but know that the guidelines are coming, and we're going to be able to go collect on that in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda : So first one on Signatera. Can you just clarify what contribution from biopharma versus clinical in the volumes that you saw in the year? And then I have a few follow-ups.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Overwhelming contribution from the clinical versus the pharma, as you'd expect. But Solomon, go ahead. Do you want to comment?\nSolomon Moshkevich: I think that was Steve. Steve, did you want to comment?\nSteven Chapman: No, I just going to say if you want to make any more color on that, go ahead.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. Look, the major accelerating growth we're seeing right now is from the clinical business for the multiple reasons I reviewed during my remarks. Pharma business is looking steady. And we've got a pretty strong pipeline as well, both have retrospective studies as well as new prospective trials. And we remain committed to our Phase III and companion diagnostic partnerships as well.\nPuneet Souda : Okay. Got it. Helpful. And then maybe for Solomon as well and trying to understand the overall TAM that is accessible and inaccessible at this point for Signatera, given that you already are in breast, and congrats on that. CRC already IO monitoring, the indications are expanding. So maybe talk to us as to the tumor-informed approach with the tissue. How much of that $20 billion or so market can you capture? And sort of what portion of the market remains sort of inaccessible because it's the tissue-based approach?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Thanks for the question. I don't think of major portions of the market being inaccessible because of a tissue-informed approach. I think the -- if anything, the tissue-informed approach gives an advantage in terms of a single product that can be applied pan cancer and across stages of disease. And I think that's how we're seeing the story play out. So to your question of penetration of the TAM, breast cancer was a really significant milestone for us, given how many patients are out there suffering from breast cancer or who are breast cancer survivors. 3.5 million tests per year now addressable and covered by Medicare is very significant. So in terms of growth, there are multiple additional indications that we see for opportunity to expand coverage with Medicare. But I think at this point, in addition to that, we're really focused on expanding the private coverage for the indications that you already saw on the slide in colorectal cancer, bladder, breast cancer and immunotherapy monitoring. So I think there's a ton of growth on the table from those 4 categories and from growing to new ones where we've shown several studies that have good validity evidence in other GI cancers in the neoadjuvant setting for breast cancer and more. Hopefully that answers your question.\nPuneet Souda : Yes, that's very helpful, Solomon. Last one for Mike if I may. Mike, the carrier testing market saw an exit from one of your competitors. So wondering sort of how are you thinking about that volume, some of that volume coming to Natera. And then could you talk to us about commercial pricing in that market? And how should we think about the ASPs in that market in '23 and beyond?\nJohn Fesko: Let me take that one, Mike. So the -- I'll comment. I mentioned previously, I think we did see the exit of a pretty sizable competitor. And Natera's actually, I think, done pretty well and gained some of that business there, largely in carrier screening. Now that's a relatively low-margin business today. And as we've outlined, we think that there's an opportunity in the near future to significantly increase the ASP of that volume that's coming in. And we just saw a guideline on expanded carrier screening from NSGC. We just saw a large benefit management company that covers 15% of commercial covered lives changed their coverage as of last week. Whereas previously you wouldn't have gotten coverage, now you will. So we think that there's a lot of upside and that sort of bet that we made on going out and saying, look, let's take on this business even though it's low margin initially, but we can turn it into something that makes sense for us, I think, was the right bet. Mike, do you want to comment further on sort of what the landscape looks like?\nMichael Brophy: No, I think that covers it well.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Max Masucci with Cowen and Company.\nMax Masucci: Congrats on another great year. So the 5-year Signatera CRC surveillance periods, it's essentially pegged to prior recommendations for CEA testing. But in breast, the risk of recurrence varies by subtype. So just based on any conversations you've had with CMS or others, how are you thinking about the ideal surveillance period for Signatera breast? Is it more likely to be static, say, 5 years across all subtypes? Or could it vary by subtype?\nSteven Chapman: Yes, so let me just add a couple of comments that you could jump in. I think we're -- if you look back to the clinical trials that we've done, I think we've done about 5 years of follow-up on those patients. And so I think we're kind of using that as we got benchmark. We're still waiting for the kind of final billing letter to come from MolDx, which will have a little bit more the detail in it, but we just kind of revert back to sort of what's in the clinical trial. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Right. Yes. So just to echo Steve's comments, the conservative view is to look at what we presented in the paper, the trial that was published in cancer -- clinical cancer research, which had follow-up of up to 5 years and testing every 6 months. But to your question, Max, the patients are treated very differently depending on their disease subtype and their stage. So we know that if a patient, for example, with triple-negative breast cancer is going to recur, they tend to recur earlier post-surgery and post-definitive treatment compared to a HR-positive HER2-negative patient whose chance of recurrence is kind of steady over even more than 5 years up to 10 years. And so we do expect to see some variation in the usage patterns across those subtypes. But I think it's still a little bit early days to see how that really plays out. And I think also, we're pretty pleased to see the initial uptake of Signatera in breast cancer as we mentioned, where really significant number of patients are just voting with their feet. And they want that information during the surveillance period as well as to help inform some tough treatment decisions.\nMax Masucci: Absolutely. Super helpful. And then my -- I'll just ask one more. So the Medicare coverage win for Signatera MIBC came in July. Did that coverage win trigger any acceleration in test ordering for Signatera IO? And then just given the sheer number of newly diagnosed operable breast cancer patients each year on a similar note, do you expect that the Signatera breast Medicare coverage win to trigger or accelerate ordering of Signatera IO in '23 and beyond?\nSteven Chapman: Yes. Let me just comment there. So I think getting a Medicare coverage, I think, definitely is an endorsement of the data. I mean, they do a very rigorous review. And I think it may not necessarily be that sort of coverage that sort of triggers additional ordering, but I think it allows us to feel comfortable to have our medical affairs team out educating physicians and our commercial team out educating physicians very thoroughly about the indication. So when you look at muscle invasive bladder, I mean, we're seeing record numbers. When you look at IO, we're seeing record numbers and growth. And when you look at any indication that's come out and gotten coverage, that really has triggered, I think, additional education and medical education around the particular tumor type, which does result in increased utilization. So certainly, breast we're seeing really strong organic interest. But once we put the power of our team behind that as well to show the data and educate physicians on the studies that we've done, we think it's going to be powerful.\nSolomon Moshkevich: I was just going to add to that, that we do see -- I think your question is about one of the nuances. This coverage in bladder or coverage in breast cancer trigger increased usage in IO monitoring. So that was an interesting question. We do see that to the extent that physicians may start using the test in one particular type of patient and then start to realize the benefits that could be applied across many more patients in their practice. And we've seen that over and over again, and so that is a natural type of step. The other thing I'll mention is that and sort of related to Puneet's question earlier, the number of patients who are eligible for immunotherapy continues to grow every time new trials read out from the top immune checkpoint inhibitor manufacturers. And that just continues to expand our eligible population as well with more and more patients on immunotherapy.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: I guess first on the commercial payer side for Signatera, what are your expectations for 2023 if we just assume no NPCN guideline inclusion? Are there any other states that have or are working on legislation for covering genetic testing like Signatera, similar to what we saw in Louisiana last year?\nSteven Chapman: Solomon, you want to take that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. There are -- I think there are 4 states who've already passed legislation and a whole lot more who are viewing legislation in their state houses. And so we're actively monitoring that, though we don't really control that. But we are involved in a lot of the discussions. I think John and his team have done a great job of educating lawmakers across the 50 states. So we do see more and more progress now with commercial payers as our evidence continues to strengthen and as the adoption among their covered patients also continues to increase. So we expect -- we do expect to be making some announcements this year of commercial coverage. And hopefully, we see some further adoption of the biomarker legislation. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything to that?\nJohn Fesko: Thanks, Solomon. Just to expand, beyond Louisiana, legislation has passed in effect now in 3 other states, including Rhode Island, Illinois, Arizona. There's legislation pending in at least 15 states this year, championed by the American Cancer Society, including some big states like Texas, Florida, New York. So we actually feel quite confident about that, and it's great for patients. It's great for the space. And that's pushing commercial policy on the payer side as well.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. Super helpful. And then maybe one on early detection. When should we expect to hear the results from the proof-of-concept study and FDA feedback just to know the path forward for that program? Are those 2023 events?\nJohn Fesko: Yes. They definitely will be. So I would say proof of concept will probably be like 2 phases. One will be slightly smaller study. And then there'll be a follow-on study that has several hundred patients, which we hope to be able to announce the results from. I think those will definitely be '23 events. And then as far as FDA goes, we do expect to get some additional feedback this year. We've already previously described some of the initial feedback. But I think the key right now is that the investment is low. We're keeping that stable at around $5 million a year. And we're in a position to crank that up on the back of very strong proof-of-concept results, which we hope to have.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.\nAndrew Cooper : Maybe to start, you've given in the past some metrics on sort of the California dynamics. Can you give us the latest and greatest there and sort of what the expectations assumed in the guide are for the status quo or potential outcome from some of the legal actions going on there?\nSteven Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. I mean, we've -- yes, just to recap, I mean, there's now an injunction in place in California, which allows us to offer Panorama to our customers there, which is great. We're -- basically in the guide, we've assumed that this is still a fairly meaningful headwind in '23 as it relates to margins. But I do think that there's upside there. As we kind of progress through the year, we'll continue to give you updates to get an increasing fraction of our customers who will migrate to Panorama over time. So I think that's another one where it's -- look, that's a hard one to model for all the obvious reasons. And when faced with those types of things, we tend to be conservative and cautious. So we've basically modeled a very kind of modest scenario there to which we hope we can beat.\nAndrew Cooper : Okay. Great. And then I want to focus maybe on one comment you made around the path to breakeven. I think you said we've done this before in women's health. So I guess does that lead us to believe when we think about some of these OpEx cuts that are coming, they're coming outside of women's health? Is there more meat on the bone there? Just how do we think about the actual dollar reductions and where some of those are actually stemming from and what they tell us about sort of the business and where you're going from that perspective.\nSteven Chapman: Yes. Sorry. Let me -- I'll make a couple of comments, and then you can feel free to jump in. I mean, look, the -- we've been really focusing on sort of running an efficient operation for a long time. And I think when you look at a lot of the spending that we've been doing in R&D, a lot of that's in the clinical trials. And I think as some of these studies start to read out and trials start to phase off, you can start to get some of the reduction in operating expenses. I'll give you one example, so the SMART study. So for 7 years in a row, we spent between $5 million and $10 million a year running that study. And now it's done. The results have read out, and we no longer have to continue making that investment anymore because the study is done. So I think that's a great example of where we've made the right investments. We funded the trial, and now the trial is completed, and it's wrapped up. So there's a lot of focus on sort of efficiency on completing some of the trials you've seen. We've now got 40 publications. I mean, that took a lot of work. But it's really sort of across the board.\nAndrew Cooper : Okay. Great. Maybe one last one. Mike, you said I think, mid-700 ASP in the clinical side for Signatera. I think last quarter, you said over 750. So I just want to make sure kind of a trajectory there, and how you think about in the guide to the degree you can give a little bit more detail just the growth in covered indications, which just seems like you're certainly focusing on versus ancillary growth that you're happy to take, but in noncovered and sort of the margin dilutive side?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. We saw another good quarter this quarter in terms of just kind of steady clinical oncology ASP progression. So I would just -- I think we're on the same -- we're kind of humming along there is the way I'd characterize it. And I think we talked about previously that leave the guidelines aside, just on things like volume mix, expansions in the covered universe, fewer people kind of in the bundle and more kind of getting to the recurrence monitoring setting. I think there's a pretty clear trajectory for us to get into the 800s over the course of the year, and looks like we're right on track with that.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with BTIG.\nMark Massaro: Congrats on an excellent 2022. So you have a number of peer-reviewed publications. And I guess I'd be curious if it's reasonable to expect you to add a couple more Medicare coverage wins this year. Obviously, you have data for lung, esophageal, melanoma, head and neck, pancreatic, ovarian, but how should we think about the timing of potential Medicare coverage determinations? And roughly how many have been submitted to MolDx that we would be waiting on some type of decision?\nJohn Fesko: Yes. Thanks, Mark. So we have a steady flow of submissions that go on at any particular time. I mean, we're not sort of -- for competitive reasons, we're not outlining the exact strategy. But I mean, the fact that we have 40 peer-reviewed publications is a big deal because you cannot get coverage without having peer-reviewed data. So we think the ability to leverage these publications to go get coverage is actually a big differentiator and a big moat for Natera. It's the same with our ADLT status, right? So from our view, no one else is eligible for an ADLT without going and getting FDA approval, which is a very difficult path for others to go out and do based on their starting point. So again, we think that's another big reimbursement that we have. You can definitely expect to see additional updates this year as we work through the kind of pipeline of submissions, but we're not going to kind of crank out the exact strategy just for competitive reasons.\nMark Massaro: Okay. And then just my last question. Looking at some other pioneers in the space like Foundation Medicine, Guardant Health, for example, we saw some pan solid tumor determinations, which kind of covers a bunch of indications with one decision. You guys have done a great job of showing a lot of data, but do you think in the future, we may be able to see a pan solid tumor Medicare coverage determination? I'm curious if you're having that conversation with Medicare and what type of framework they might be communicating to you.\nSteven Chapman: Yes. So I think we've always sort of said that we think that you really have to go indication by indication until you've hit a certain threshold. There's sort of a tipping point where it becomes more of a sort of a pan cancer view. And I think we're really moving fast and getting through the indication-by-indication coverage. So I think we're doing a great job. We're delivering the evidence, and that's going to be the foundation for everything. The great thing about Signatera and the tumor-informed approach is that it's pan cancer. We don't have to go out and kind of redesign the assay. We just run the same platform across all different tumor types, and I think that enables this path to pan cancer. So stay tuned. I think it's possible there could be some momentum on pan cancer in the future. But we're going to have to see how things pan out.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's meeting. We thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In December, the American College of Medical Genetics published a practice guideline that recommended offering noninvasive prenatal screening of 22q deletion syndrome to all patients. The guideline specifically referenced the SNP-based screening method Natera developed and profiled in our 20,000-patient SMART study, which published last year in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 22q deletion syndrome is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans, affecting about 1 in 15 live births. It's more common than other genetic conditions recommended for routine screening such as trisomy 18, trisomy 13, cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. 22q deletion syndrome is a leading cause of congenital heart defects, palate issues, immunodeficiencies, endocrine dysfunction and neurological issues. Patients born with 22q deletion syndrome may be very challenging to diagnose with a median age of diagnosis at 4.7 years after seeing on average 7 different clinical specialties prior to molecular diagnosis. Treatment with calcium from birth can prevent seizures and brain damage caused by hypocalcemia. In our SMART study, we saw 83% sensitivity in a 0.05% false positive rate, resulting in a very high positive predictive value of 53%. We're excited about the momentum created by the publication of SMART and ACMG's new recommendation that all patients be offered 22q dilution screening. We believe that 22q deletion screening will be a significant differentiator for Natera. Because Natera runs targeted sequencing of SNPs and we can differentiate maternal from fetal DNA, we can cost effectively sequence at a much deeper level across the 22q region versus labs simply doing massively parallel signature sequencing. These differences contribute to our high sensitivity, specificity and PPV. Additionally, today, most labs only touched for 22q deletions above 2.5 megabases. This is a major limitation because 41% of high-risk 22q results in our SMART study were below 2.5 megabases. Natera is not limited in this way. Finally, we've created a significant competitive lead with our published data. To our knowledge, Natera is the only lab who's published a multisite prospective study of 22q screening with genetic confirmation in the majority of subjects. The SMART study took 7 years to complete and published and will likely never be done again. To our knowledge, there are no other prospective trials ongoing, in which cases data lead will persist for a long time. We think these significant performance differences will be important to physicians, especially given there is no guideline recommending 22q be offered to all pregnant women. We believe physicians will place more value on 22q performance going forward. These differentiators may also be important for health plans as we start to see coverage come into place as we believe will happen. It's possible that payers will limit their coverage to only those 22q tests that have been validated to its [expense]. Beyond NIPT, we're also seeing guidelines change for expanded carrier screening. Earlier this month, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guidelines to recommend expanded carrier screening being made available to all individuals considering a reproduction. This follows a recommendation from ACMG in 2021 that expanded carrier screening should be offered to all pregnant patients. We're also seeing these guideline changes lead to medical policy changes at health plans. In fact, just this month, one large benefit manager that covers 15% of commercial covered lives with a new policy that supports the use of expanded carrier screening. There is still work to be done here, but the fact that we are now seeing progress is important. Okay. I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss organ health. Steve?"

            "content": "Let me take that one, Mike. So the -- I'll comment. I mentioned previously, I think we did see the exit of a pretty sizable competitor. And Natera's actually, I think, done pretty well and gained some of that business there, largely in carrier screening. Now that's a relatively low-margin business today. And as we've outlined, we think that there's an opportunity in the near future to significantly increase the ASP of that volume that's coming in. And we just saw a guideline on expanded carrier screening from NSGC. We just saw a large benefit management company that covers 15% of commercial covered lives changed their coverage as of last week. Whereas previously you wouldn't have gotten coverage, now you will. So we think that there's a lot of upside and that sort of bet that we made on going out and saying, look, let's take on this business even though it's low margin initially, but we can turn it into something that makes sense for us, I think, was the right bet. Mike, do you want to comment further on sort of what the landscape looks like? Thanks, Solomon. Just to expand, beyond Louisiana, legislation has passed in effect now in 3 other states, including Rhode Island, Illinois, Arizona. There's legislation pending in at least 15 states this year, championed by the American Cancer Society, including some big states like Texas, Florida, New York. So we actually feel quite confident about that, and it's great for patients. It's great for the space. And that's pushing commercial policy on the payer side as well. Yes. They definitely will be. So I would say proof of concept will probably be like 2 phases. One will be slightly smaller study. And then there'll be a follow-on study that has several hundred patients, which we hope to be able to announce the results from. I think those will definitely be '23 events. And then as far as FDA goes, we do expect to get some additional feedback this year. We've already previously described some of the initial feedback. But I think the key right now is that the investment is low. We're keeping that stable at around $5 million a year. And we're in a position to crank that up on the back of very strong proof-of-concept results, which we hope to have. Yes. Thanks, Mark. So we have a steady flow of submissions that go on at any particular time. I mean, we're not sort of -- for competitive reasons, we're not outlining the exact strategy.

            "name": "Steven Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. We had a great year in 2022, both in terms of commercial execution and achieving key milestones. We processed 2.1 million tests, which is year-on-year growth of 32%. Revenues were $820.2 million for the full year, $40 million higher than the midpoint of our initial 2022 guidance, up 31% from 2021 and up 37% when excluding the onetime QIAGEN revenue. Business momentum continue in Q4 with volume growth of 28% and product revenue growth of 28% year-over-year, even off a bigger base and with a difficult year-over-year growth comparison after a very strong Q4 2021. We performed 196,000 oncology tests in 2022, representing growth of 158% with 64,000 tests performed in Q4. This demonstrates continued strong sequential growth of 21% or an increase of 11,000 units versus Q3 of 2022. We estimate that now more than 30% of oncologists in the United States are ordering Signatera. We've achieved several key milestones even since our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this year. First, we were very pleased to see our prospective multisite CIRCULATE study was published in January on the cover of Nature Medicine, which gives you some sense of excitement that the data is generating in the field. Consistent with our earlier publications in both colorectal cancer and other tumor types, the data showed strong, predictive and prognostic value of Signatera 18 months out post-surgery. Solomon will dive deeper into these topics later in the call. Second, we received confirmation from MolDx that Signatera had met coverage requirements for adjuvant and recurrence monitoring in patients with Stage IIb or higher breast cancer across all subtypes. We estimate that Stage IIb in higher population could represent roughly 1 million tests per year, and breast cancer patients already account for a growing portion of our Signatera volume. In addition to the current coverage, we've got a pipeline of data designed to further highlight Signatera's utility and expand coverage in breast cancer. In fact, we expect to publish 2 large-scale breast cancer studies this year, each with approximately 1,000 plasma samples. In women's health, we were very encouraged to see the American College of Medical Genetics issue updated guidance to include a recommendation that all pregnant individuals be offered screening for 22q deletion syndrome. ACMG's guideline referenced the strong 22q performance results achieved in the SMART study, and we hope to see action by other medical societies later this year as they digest and incorporate the findings of that study. We were also pleased to see another guideline adoption for expanded carrier screening as the National Society of Genetic Counselors recently offered a very strong endorsement. We will get into this in more detail later in the call. In Oregon Health, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation issued new guidelines recognizing the value of donor-derived cell-free DNA with a Class 1 Level B recommendation. We continue to work towards Medicare coverage for our Prospera heart test. In addition to heart, we eagerly await the publication of our perspective real-world RenaCARE study, which evaluated Renasight in chronic kidney disease patients. We expect that study to publish in the first half of this year. Moving to 2023 guidance. We are setting our initial 2023 revenue guidance in a range of $980 million to $1 billion. We expect to generate this continued top line momentum even as we reduce operating expenses from 2022 level and dramatically reduce our cash burn. I'm really pleased to inform everyone that we will be guiding to a cash burn reduction of roughly $150 million compared to 2022, and we are reiterating our path to hitting a cash flow breakeven quarter in 2024. As we mentioned previously, we've included about $5 million of annual expense all in for early cancer detection in our budget. This doesn't include the cost of a new PMA level prospective study, which we estimate would be about $30 million over 2 years, if required. As we said before, we're awaiting the results of our proof-of-concept study and further feedback from the FDA on the [indiscernible] trial. Once we have the results and feedback in hand, we can then decide whether it's necessary to pull the trigger on a stepped-up level of investment. It goes without saying we wouldn't do that without having very favorable results from the proof-of-concept study. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the appointment of Ruth Williams-Brinkley to our Board of Directors. Ruth is a seasoned health care executive with 3 decades of industry experience. She currently serves as President of Kaiser Permanente Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic states, where she oversees regional operations. She also held leadership roles at large health systems earlier in her career. We are thrilled to welcome Ruth to the Board, and we look forward to working with her. Okay. Great. Let's get into more details on the next slide. In 2022, we processed approximately 2.1 million tests, a 32% increase over a very strong 2021 growth year. This represents strong traction across the businesses, and I think we are well positioned for continued growth. I'm going to start off talking about women's health. Today, we estimate that roughly half of the eligible patients in the United States are getting an NIPT. While that underlying market continues to grow, we've continued to consolidate market share. As we've also discussed, guideline adoption for 22q and expanded carrier screening are additional opportunities to further expand access and help more patients. And we are pleased to see recent traction in both areas. Let me turn it over to John, our Chief Business Officer, to discuss some of the latest updates on these topics. John? Great. Thanks, John. Our initiatives in organ health are going well. We continue to benefit from the publication of the large-scale multisite prospective Trifecta study in kidney transplant, which came out last fall. The result of that trial were excellent and appear to have been well received by the community. In heart transplant, we are excited for the readout of the independent academically led DTRT study. In DTRT, investigators tested greater than 450 plasma samples from greater than 150 heart transplant recipients across 7 top academic sites with biopsy match samples and clinical follow-up of up to 3.5 years. We believe this is one of the most significant trials to date in the field, and we look forward to the results being published soon. Our momentum in heart is timely because ISHLT, the main governing body, just updated its guidelines to include donor-derived cell-free DNA testing for surveillance in heart transplant recipients. I also mentioned Renasight at the top of the call. As a reminder, Renasight is our genetic test for patients that have been previously diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. The test can determine whether they may have a genetic cause of their chronic kidney disease. We think there are more than 1 million newly diagnosed patients per year and about 37 million patients living with chronic kidney disease. With more than 10% of the population in the United States having CKD and being eligible for testing, we think this is one of the largest areas of health care that can be improved with genetic testing. 3 years ago, we worked with the world's leading investigators from Columbia, Yale, UPenn, UPMC, NYU, Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, among others, to design the definitive RenaCARE study. We completed enrollment in RenaCARE in August, having enrolled more than 1,600 patients from over 30 centers. The study is designed to assess how Renasight's genetic findings may impact the clinical management of patient care. As the results readout, it's important to put them in context. I think hereditary cancer is an instructive comparison. In a large study of nearly 3,000 cancer patients published in JAMA Oncology, 13.3% of patients had a pathogenic germline variant indicating hereditary cancer. And of those patients with a high variant, 28.2% had resulting treatment modifications. As RenaCARE read out, we will be looking at the same metrics, what fraction of the study participants have a pathogenic variant associated with their CKD and what fraction of the positive patients treatment was modified after the pathogenic variant was discovered with the Renasight panel. We think the RenaCARE study could position us for guideline inclusion in the future. This is a very large opportunity, and we already have a distribution channel in place through our existing nephrology call point. Stay tuned for more updates on this important opportunity. With that, I will now turn it over to Solomon to review our oncology results in more detail. Solomon? No, I think you thoroughly covered things. Thanks, Mike. Yes. Mike, let me first kind of just comment on some of these COGS projects. So we've really done a good job over the years of rallying our resources on these big cost reduction projects. And these are pretty straightforward. I mean, these have to do with versioning to the NovaSeq versus the NextSeq, for example, or expanding capacity in our -- in certain facilities. So these aren't like technically complex projects, they're really straightforward. And so I think we have pretty high confidence in hitting them. We've got a handful of like really big COGS reduction projects that I think are making up a significant chunk of what we're showing here as we move out into the future guidance. But Mike, do you want to comment a little bit on the margin progression further? Yes. And just to be clear, we don't need those -- any of those guidelines to come in to get to that 50% margin target. Yes, I'll take that. So 22q, I think, is really the whole ball game for [microlesion] testing. So when we actually led the coding submission to the AMA, which started, I think, in 2017, the code was growing in 2019. And today, the pricing that we have in payer contracts into CMS is for 22q. Other deletions are included, but 22q is sort of the base microdeletion that's part of that infrastructure. So the pricing from payers will be the same, whether it's 22q or whether it's a broad microdeletion. We think 22q is where most of the interest is as we go forward. And I think that's where the guidelines are going to be focused. And we've got a lot of differentiators. I mean, I know John sort of highlighted some of those, but these differentiators really make a big difference, both with physicians and we think also with payers. And I think it's going to be interesting to see how this pans out in the future. I also mentioned on expanded carrier screening. So today, we have a good guideline in place from NSGC. There's a strong guideline from ACMG. And the ACAR guideline is actually pretty strong. We think it's, in fact, supportive of expanded carrier screening. And that's one of the reasons why you're seeing payers starting to issue positive coverage policies. So we mentioned on the call that one of the lab benefit managers that covers 15% of all the commercial covered lives in the United States just last week issued a positive guideline for expanded carrier screening. And so that's new incremental upside that's not in the model. And I think as Mike mentioned, your product mix is sort of one of the reasons why you've seen the slight reduction in margin recently. Some of that comes from us making a proactive decision to take on some of the low-margin [Semaphore] business as they went out of business. And we thought that, that was a good idea to do because we knew that these guidelines were coming, and it turns out that was the right decision. Now we've seen since they went out of business and we picked up a significant chunk of that volume, we've seen this big lab benefit management company, they'll come out and say they're going to be covering expanded carrier screening. We've seen the NSGC guidelines come out. So I think that was the right decision is sort of temporarily take on a larger book of expanded carrier screening volume, have a slight reduction in the overall margin, but know that the guidelines are coming, and we're going to be able to go collect on that in the future. No, I just going to say if you want to make any more color on that, go ahead. Yes, so let me just add a couple of comments that you could jump in. I think we're -- if you look back to the clinical trials that we've done, I think we've done about 5 years of follow-up on those patients. And so I think we're kind of using that as we got benchmark. We're still waiting for the kind of final billing letter to come from MolDx, which will have a little bit more the detail in it, but we just kind of revert back to sort of what's in the clinical trial. Solomon? Yes. Let me just comment there. So I think getting a Medicare coverage, I think, definitely is an endorsement of the data. I mean, they do a very rigorous review. And I think it may not necessarily be that sort of coverage that sort of triggers additional ordering, but I think it allows us to feel comfortable to have our medical affairs team out educating physicians and our commercial team out educating physicians very thoroughly about the indication. So when you look at muscle invasive bladder, I mean, we're seeing record numbers. When you look at IO, we're seeing record numbers and growth. And when you look at any indication that's come out and gotten coverage, that really has triggered, I think, additional education and medical education around the particular tumor type, which does result in increased utilization. So certainly, breast we're seeing really strong organic interest. But once we put the power of our team behind that as well to show the data and educate physicians on the studies that we've done, we think it's going to be powerful. Solomon, you want to take that? Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. Sorry. Let me -- I'll make a couple of comments, and then you can feel free to jump in. I mean, look, the -- we've been really focusing on sort of running an efficient operation for a long time. And I think when you look at a lot of the spending that we've been doing in R&D, a lot of that's in the clinical trials. And I think as some of these studies start to read out and trials start to phase off, you can start to get some of the reduction in operating expenses. I'll give you one example, so the SMART study. So for 7 years in a row, we spent between $5 million and $10 million a year running that study. And now it's done. The results have read out, and we no longer have to continue making that investment anymore because the study is done. So I think that's a great example of where we've made the right investments. We funded the trial, and now the trial is completed, and it's wrapped up. So there's a lot of focus on sort of efficiency on completing some of the trials you've seen. We've now got 40 publications. I mean, that took a lot of work. But it's really sort of across the board. Yes. So I think we've always sort of said that we think that you really have to go indication by indication until you've hit a certain threshold. There's sort of a tipping point where it becomes more of a sort of a pan cancer view. And I think we're really moving fast and getting through the indication-by-indication coverage. So I think we're doing a great job. We're delivering the evidence, and that's going to be the foundation for everything. The great thing about Signatera and the tumor-informed approach is that it's pan cancer. We don't have to go out and kind of redesign the assay. We just run the same platform across all different tumor types, and I think that enables this path to pan cancer. So stay tuned. I think it's possible there could be some momentum on pan cancer in the future. But we're going to have to see how things pan out."

Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, November 8, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Michael Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of 2022. On the line, I'm joined by Steve Chapman, our CEO; and Solomon Moshkevich, General Manager of Oncology. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be available at investor.natera.com. Starting on slide two. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our operational and financial outlook and projections, our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various current and future products, including product capabilities, expected release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, November 8, 2022. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. Let's start with our Q3 highlights. As you can see from the press release, we had another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew approximately 33% over Q3 last year and we processed 518,000 tests this quarter growing 27% year-over-year. We're seeing strong momentum across all product lines and I'll spend more time on that in a moment. We are pleased to be able to once again raise our 2022 guidance to $810 million to $830 million. At the midpoint, this represents an increase in our revenue guidance by over $40 million, compared to our initial guide in March and this new range implies annual revenue growth of 37%, excluding the one-time QIAGEN milestone in 2021 of $29 million. We are exercising caution in forecasting some of the early results from the launch of the California prenatal screening program. There have been a few legal developments with the program in the last few days and we are evaluating the impact. But for now, we are being careful with our forecast. In addition, we've recently integrated our Empower and Signatera sales teams to focus on centers where both Signatera and Empower in demand. I'll get to the expected benefits of that move later, but we are being cautious with the guide to account for the disruption in the immediate term. One of the key reasons for the revenue raise is the strong momentum we are seeing with Signatera, which is performing well above our internal volume forecast for the year. We processed roughly 132,000 oncology tests this year, and we think we are on track for roughly 175,000 units this year. We will expand on our Signatera volumes further in a moment. The breadth and depth of our data generation for Signatera across multiple tumor types is a key competitive advantage over others in this space. In fact, we now have 35 peer-reviewed published studies, with 13 publications so far in 2022 and several more coming soon. We were pleased to publish our first validation study in ovarian cancer in the Journal of Gynecological Oncology. In addition, our large-scale gastroesophageal validation study, which includes over 900 timepoints, was just accepted in JCO Precision Oncology. Finally, we are pleased to announce that the CIRCULATE study, now with 18 months of median follow-up, has been accepted in Nature Medicine, which has an impact factor of 87. And we look forward to its publication shortly. Our Organ Health products were a strong contributor to both volume and revenue growth this quarter. We announced the second publication from the Trifecta study in Transplantation. This publication demonstrated our Prospera Kidney test was superior to the current standard-of-care donor-specific antibody in predicting antibody-mediated rejection. I'll spend more time on this data in a few moments. Finally, we are pleased to share that an independent committee of our Board of Directors has completed a detailed independent investigation into the allegations made in the March short seller report. The Board was assisted in this matter by WilmerHale, which as you know is a leading international law firm with deep experience in investigations like this. The WilmerHale team had access to company executives, personnel, communications and other company records. Based on the investigation, the independent committee, on behalf of the Board, has concluded that the allegations of wrongdoing against the company in the report were unfounded. We weren't surprised with the findings. As you recall, we had a very detailed response and open Q&A the next morning where we reiterated the strength of our compliance program. And following that call, based on our confidence in the company and the belief in our compliance program, members of the executive team bought stock and took salary in the form of equity for the remainder of 2022. It's great to have this investigation completed as it involved a substantial amount of time and energy from our team to support the activity on the outside law firm, but we were happy to do the additional work to respond to all of their requests. Of course, given the high profile nature of that short report and some of the accusations made about the NIPT space in the January New York Times article, we weren't surprised to receive inquiries from regulators, which we have responded to. There have been no specific claims or allegations made, just a customarily broad request you would expect. As we said from the outset, we feel we have a very strong compliance program in place, and I think wrapping up the Independent Board investigation, which involved a detailed review of the allegations and found no wrongdoing by the company, represents an important milestone. Okay, great. Let's get into more of the detailed business trends on the next slide. As I mentioned, volumes grew rapidly once again in Q3. As a reminder, in Q3 of 2021, we got a big one-time bump from a key competitor leaving the market, so despite that big base of volumes, we continued to deliver rapid growth. The Women's Health business continues to expand and we continue to get balanced contributions from NIPT market expansion and competitive wins. I'm not going to go into detail on Women's Health on the call today, so I'll just spend a moment on that opportunity. First, we think the NIPT market is only about 45% to 50% penetrated, so there's still a large opportunity to help more patients. Second, we think Natera is well positioned going forward, given our clinical differentiation and our leadership in peer-reviewed evidence, including the SMART trial, which is the largest prospective trial ever done looking at both common80-20s and the 22q microdeletion. Finally, we think it's possible there may be some critical milestone opportunities ahead where societies may advocate for expansion of prenatal genetic testing. So there's a lot of great things happening behind the scenes. Okay, back to volumes. In addition to our Women's Health growth, the Prospera transplant test continues to ramp significantly in kidney, and we are now also seeing traction in heart and lung transplants. The positive volumes in heart and lung are leading indicators that they aren't yet contributing to revenues, and we are working to get reimbursement in those segments in the future. Finally, our largest contributor to volume growth has been the increase we've seen in Signatera clinical volumes. The next slide gives you detailed historical snapshot of the traction we're seeing with Signatera. In Q3 of 2022, we performed 53,000 Signatera and Altera tests, representing growth of 153% year-over-year. For 2022, we expect to perform 175,000 Signatera and Altera tests for growth of approximately 130%. The volume growth at this stage is coming from both increases in repeat ordering from the base of patients that started with Signatera previously, and a rapid increase in the number of oncologists that are ordering Signatera and adding new patients. For example, we estimate that roughly 25% of the 12,000 community oncologists in the United States have ordered a Signatera test in the past quarter. I think that's a strong testament to how quickly we think Signatera is becoming integrated into the standard-of-care. A little more than half of these volumes are Medicare reimbursed indications like colorectal cancer and IO monitoring, and a significant chunk of the remaining volume is in indications where we have strong data and are actively pursuing Medicare reimbursement. We had previously committed to breaking out these volumes annually, but I wanted to share these numbers a quarter early, because this slide is important to understanding our growth strategy of Signatera. Given the volume and the reimbursement traction we are seeing, we think it's clearly the right strategy to continue to establish Signatera as a standard-of-care for MRD and recurrence monitoring, even if the unreimbursed volume growth pressures our margins in the immediate term. Mike will get into our guidance later in the call, but the rapid growth in Signatera volumes, particularly in the areas that aren't reimbursed today, but we believe we have a near-term opportunity for coverage, is one of the reasons we're increasing the cash burn forecast for 2022. We continue to expect a major reduction in cash flow in 2023, followed by a path to cash flow breakeven, even with the rapid increase in Signatera non-covered indications that we are seeing now. This next slide shows you that volume growth is translating into revenue growth. Total revenue growth of $210 million increased 33%, which is a larger increase in our volume growth of 27%. As critical to Signatera volumes growth, the ASP progression is particularly important to the overall model. Clinical Signatera ASPs continued to increase from about $500 last year to over $700 last quarter, and are now over $750 in Q3. We believe our ASPs will continue to improve, driven by greater coverage. And in the near-term, the mix of Medicare reimbursed tests is improving, and an increasing proportion of our volumes are starting to come from the recurrence monitoring indication, which is reimbursed by Medicare at the ADLT rate of $3,900. In transplant, we are seeing some limited pressure on ASPs as we see the mix shift to currently uncovered heart and lung tests, although we've submitted for coverage for both of those indications. In kidney we haven't been impacted by Medicare Advantage or commercial mix shift as our payer mix has remained stable and we've always incorporated those factors into our ASP. In addition, we've seen some pressure on germline ASPs, but there's a handful of opportunities we're working, including possibly gaining increased coverage with forthcoming guidelines. In Organ Health, we continued to make progress on several key initiatives. We now have a significant volume of peer-reviewed data across kidney, heart and lung indications. In fact, we published 13 publications in the past 12 months alone. I'm going to highlight on the slide here our second publication from the Trifecta study. The study demonstrated that donor-derived cell-free DNA testing was superior to the standard-of-care donor-specific antigen. Both components of Prospera's algorithm, donor-derived cell-free DNA fraction and estimated quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA, outperform DSA and predict the AMR with an AUC of 0.84 and 0.85 versus the current standard-of-care having an AUC of 0.66. We expect the continued drumbeat of strong data across our Organ Health franchise to continue in 2023. We're very pleased with how we're doing and of the great work our team has done to help physicians and patients. Now before I turn it over to Solomon to discuss Oncology, I want to talk about our early cancer detection efforts. We continue the development of our DNA methylation platform from both colorectal and multi-cancer early detection products. We remain on track to present initial case-control performance data for our CRC ECD assay in 2023. On the regulatory front, we continue our discussions with the FDA and are hoping to receive final feedback in 2023. During our first pre-submission meeting, we had a productive discussion with the FDA with two pathways emerging. The first path includes using the oral health samples for the FDA validation study, followed by a post-market surveillance study. The second path could use the oral health study for the initial validation, while we're conducting a new prospective study for the FDA. While we await the final feedback from the FDA, we are finalizing the design for either option. We are excited to provide additional information about our ECD program in 2023. With that, I will now turn it over to Solomon to review our Oncology results in more detail. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. Today I will touch on some of the key drivers of our commercial success in Oncology; highlights from our clinical data pipeline; and I'll dive a bit deeper on the key investments that we're making for the future. Steve described the incredible growth that we've observed with the Signatera MRD test. As a reminder, this personalized tumor-informed test has been shown to detect cancer recurrence in many months earlier than standard diagnostic imaging. It can help inform treatment decisions and monitoring the quantitative dynamics to help identify early whether a treatment is effective. The product has been very sticky for both physicians and patients with high rates of repeat testing. We believe our commercial success is attributable to four key strengths. First, we have a large industry-leading team of tenured sales professionals, and we combine that with a team of more than 50 in medical and scientific affairs, including four board-certified physicians, who've practiced oncology. This team is calling on oncologists and surgeons, and we've recently started to gain momentum with large strategic accounts around the country, including the VA and other leading groups. We are really very proud to have been selected as a partner to the veteran community, especially heading into Veterans Day later this week. Number two, our market access team has a strong track record of execution with MolDX, as we've repeatedly secured both coverage and good pricing. For example, our colorectal coverage includes both adjuvant and recurrence monitoring, rather than being limited to just adjuvant. In bladder, it includes neoadjuvant, adjuvant and recurrence monitoring. We think these distinctions are important and are a competitive advantage. On pricing, we've received ADLT status, which is hard for other MRD labs to replicate. And the pricing we've secured this past quarter for the IO monitoring service is at $7,489 per patient. Number three, strong user experience with mobile phlebotomy, physician portals, fast turnaround times and electronic medical record integration. For example, our national partnership with Epic, where access to Signatera is already pre-installed in the latest version of their EMR software, this experience is further enhanced by our portfolio of oncology tests. For example, Signatera and Altera testing from the same tumor and blood specimens. We're always striving to get better. With this infrastructure in place, we believe that we're poised to scale quickly and sustainably as we prepare for several key milestones ahead, including potential inclusion into the NCCN guidelines, expansion of coverage by Medicare and private payers and readout of several key clinical studies. And that's the fourth major advantage, our data leadership. Given the significant time it takes to collect longitudinal samples and gather long-term clinical follow-up, this may be one of the biggest advantages that we have. I'm very proud of the execution of our team, which includes 13 peer-reviewed publications thus far in 2022 and 35 overall across more than two dozen different cancer types. We have 10 additional manuscripts in submission right now, so our evidence generation continues to move at a rapid pace. In the past three months, we published our clinical validation study in ovarian cancer, a Phase 2 study in uveal melanoma, and we had two oral presentations at the European Society for Medical Oncology Conference in Paris in colorectal and breast cancers. Touching on a few highlights here. In the multi-site ovarian study, we analyzed 163 samples from 69 patients. And with serial testing, Signatera detected recurrence with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with an average lead time of 10-months versus standard imaging. There are approximately 20,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed each year in the U.S., and we believe Signatera can help inform treatment decisions for many of those patients. In early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, the BELLINI study presented at ESMO demonstrated the power of monitoring ctDNA dynamics with Signatera during neoadjuvant immunotherapy. This builds upon the significant base of evidence that Natera is already developing in breast cancer, with published studies from the I-SPY2 consortia in the neoadjuvant setting, and the University of Leicester in the adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings, plus additional manuscripts already submitted for publication, plus the ongoing Phase 3 trial in triple-negative and BRCA-mutated breast cancer, plus the additional studies in the pipeline, which have not yet been announced. We are deeply committed to proving the utility of Signatera for patients with breast cancer. Finally, in colorectal cancer, leading GI oncologists presented real-world data from over 16,000 Signatera patients with Stage 1 to 3 disease at ESMO. The results were in line with prior evidence, showing that MRD-negative patients showed no significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. This will be submitted for publication in the near future and will be a great addition to the existing body of evidence. This sets the stage for our next major readout from the CIRCULATE consortium, with clinical follow-up now extended to 18-months, which has been formally accepted for publication by Nature Medicine. And in GI cancers beyond CRC, we had another validation study recently accepted for publication in gastroesophageal cancer, coming from a multi-site real-world study with over 900 plasma samples collected from over 200 patients. We believe this is going to pave the way for Signatera to help inform management in this challenging disease, which is the sixth most common type of cancer in the U.S., affecting approximately 47,000 new patients per year. This one is somewhat personal for me as we lost my father to esophageal cancer last year. Additionally, we were pleased to see a recently revised practice guideline from the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, JSMO, providing what appears to be a strong recommendation for the use of serial MRD testing in colorectal cancer. We think this is a great step forward for MRD. This clinical evidence often drives payer coverage directly or in some cases, it generates data that's required to inform the design of definitive Phase 3 trials. At some point in the coming years, we believe there will be an inflection point where Signatera will be fully adopted and reimbursed in pan-cancer fashion, much like CT scans, without the need for separate trials in each indication. But we are not quite there yet. Our current approved indications in colorectal, bladder and immunotherapy response monitoring represent an estimated addressable market of up to 2.5 million tests per year at full penetration, giving our commercial team plenty to do as we work to expand coverage even further. Finally, to achieve our long-term vision, we are making several substantial investments in the business. Number one, we're expecting and processing tests ahead of reimbursement and expanding our footprint and lab staff. This sets us up to be in an excellent position in the future where we're already scaled for success. Number two, we are investing heavily in clinical trials to establish pan-cancer clinical and economic utility for Signatera. Number three, in addition to the current LDT version of Signatera, we're developing an IVD version of the product. This is to support global expansion into Japan and Europe, which require regulatory approval in order to gain market access, and approval by the FDA as a companion diagnostic and eventually, as a surrogate endpoint. Number four, we're expanding our menu and expect to add a liquid biopsy therapy selection assay to the product menu in the future in addition to what we think is a promising early cancer detection program. Plus, we're advancing the Signatera technology, which we think is going to pay dividends in the future. Finally, we're building out a promising new data service. Several of our research partners have already started to access our real-world database with its unique combination of tumor and germline exome data, with serial ctDNA dynamics and clinical outcomes, which together can generate novel insights to inform the development of new therapies and new biomarkers. By the end of this year, we expect to have run over 250,000 cumulative Signatera tests. So it's not unrealistic to think in the future, we will have over a million Signatera test data points in our database, which we think creates a great opportunity. Although these are capital-intensive investments, we think they're the right things to do for the long-term future of the business. Now I'd like to hand over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The first slide is just our standard view of the Q3 results. Steve covered the key trends on volumes and revenues. Our Q3 gross margins were similar to our Q2 levels. Steve touched on the fact that we were able to deliver strong revenue growth despite some headwinds in transplant and germline ASPs, and the fact that we are blowing out the Signatera volume forecast this year. With the strong volume growth we've had, we continue to experience some backlogs and test sessioning, although we do expect to have that fully resolved during Q4. All of those variables together modestly held down gross margins in the quarter, compared to what we think they can be in the future. R&D expense was lower in the quarter, due to a change in accounting treatment of expenses related to the small technology acquisition we made last year. But pro forma for that, operating expenses were basically flat sequentially. Since the last quarter, we fielded a few questions on our increase in receivables this year. For context, if receivables trends had remained constant to Q4 2021 levels, we would have collected roughly $80 million in additional cash by this point in the year. We think about $50 million of this cash can be collected between now and Q1, and the remaining $30 million would flow in over time as we collect from Medicare on a longer collection cycle. To provide a bit more detail, there are two primary drivers for the increase in receivables. One, is the temporary issue we described on the Q2 call in which we held a one-time bolus of accrued Women's Health claims in our system prior to submitting to payers for reimbursement. That initially represented about 60,000 claims, all of which will be billed out by the end of Q4. We estimate those claims could yield roughly $25 million in cash, and we expect that cash to flow in between now and Q1 next year. The second driver is caused by the dramatic increase in Medicare-reimbursed Signatera revenue we have accrued this year. We now have almost a full-year's worth of IO monitoring claims that we have accrued as revenues, but we were waiting for final pricing and Z code confirmation prior to submitting for payments. Now that we have those details, we will start to bill those claims out to Medicare. We've learned this year that at least in the near-term, our Medicare cash collection cycle will be slower than what we experience in our commercial insured business. At present, it takes us about 10-months to get from test support to the cash collections from Medicare, because Medicare patients require additional manual processing, which takes time to complete. Over time, we think this process can get much faster as we implement more automation, but that will be a very gradual path to improvement. I'll also note that DSOs increase slowed between Q1 and Q2 and DSOs increased very modestly in Q3, 105 days to 110 days or so, so that's two quarters of DSOs stabilizing out. Okay, we've covered a lot of ground today. And I just want to summarize where we stand strategically, especially for those of you that are newer to the story. We've already established ourselves as a market leader in multiple large and growing markets. We've got a significant lead in generating data and frontloaded our investment in commercial infrastructure. We are reaping the benefits as the volumes come in and the revenues continue to grow. Because of that we can generate significant returns on invested capital by according these established products onto lower cost sequencers and scaling our cost-efficient Austin lab. So just that base case drives clear visibility to cash flow breakeven. Steve referenced the integration of our hereditary cancer commercial team within our oncology sales team. That strategic change, plus a small workforce reduction resulted in an elimination of about 115 employee positions this month as part of our 2023 budgeting cycle, with the primary driver being efficiencies we identified during our review. With that move complete, we think we're in great position to drive growth next year, while holding operating expense growth in the low single-digits. That combination will allow us to very significantly reduce cash burn in 2023, and we still have line of sight to a cash flow breakeven path thereafter. Of course, we have a number of potentially meaningful catalysts that we think can be achieved in the near-term, as you can see on the right hand side of the page. One or more of these could be achieved as early as this year. Any one of these catalysts would represent another step function change for the company, and we've spent a lot of time describing why we believe we're in a great position to achieve each of them. Okay, good. Let's get to the next slide and the updated guidance for the year. Steve touched on the update to the revenue guidance range for the rest of the year. We are seeing strong volumes and positive ASP trends in Clinical Oncology. We are slightly adjusting our gross margin target based on where we stand on a year-to-date basis to 44% to 47%, with stronger Signatera volumes being dilutive to gross margins currently. The good news here is that there is a path to getting paid on a much broader array of our Signatera claims in the near future, and I expect everyone would agree it wouldn't make sense for us to shut off CRC claims ahead of a possible NCCN guideline change or shut off breast cancer test ahead of, for example, possible coverage for Medicare in breast cancer. In addition, we do see a path to improving ASP on some of our germline testing through anticipated guideline changes, and we do think there is a path for us to get coverage on heart and lung in the transplant business On our cash burn guidance, we now expect to be at roughly $450 million in 2022 with significant improvement in \u201823 and beyond. As outlined, this was caused by an increase in DSOs and some pressure in germline ASPs that we think is fixable. As Solomon mentioned, there's always strategic changes we could make if we wanted to reduce cash burn further. For example, we could limit volumes in uncovered Signatera indications or reduce our clinical trial spend; although we don't think those are smart decisions, given the growth opportunity ahead. And so with that, we're very pleased to share these results with you today. And let me hand the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Before opening the lines for questions, I would like to turn the call over to CEO, Steve Chapman. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. Thanks, operator. Just one quick clarification, so earlier in the call on the prepared remarks, I said that we expect to do about 175,000 Signatera tests this year. It was actually meant to be greater than 185,000. And I just want to reiterate that we're expecting to see robust quarter-on-quarter growth between Q3 and Q4 in Signatera. Thank you. Let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So a couple of questions. The first one on the 53,000 oncology test, I mean, that was well ahead of us. And more than 185,000 that you are guiding to here and that implies 145% growth year-over-year. So real -- the first question really is how do you think the ASP growth is going to trend now as a result of the ADLT Medicare payments that you're getting obviously different payments, different indications? So how should we think about ASP? That's number one. And then number two is really, I think the big question here is given one year of experience that you have had with this assay and the remarkable growth that you're seeing here sort of how should we think about the 2023 growth here? Because obviously, you -- this is -- you have a leadership position here and you're continuing to grow very meaningfully in this market.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So let me make a couple of comments, and then I think Mike you can dig into the ASP and, I think \u201823 growth trends. But I'll just say, first of all, we're obviously very pleased with the rapid growth and the uptake that we've seen both in colorectal and then in indications beyond colorectal. And we think this is just the beginning. I mean, if you look at the momentum that we have, I think we're really building a great flywheel here, especially with the data. So we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And we certainly are seeing a shift over time into that recurrence monitoring indication as you'd expect, it's more and more patients come into the pipeline. But at the same time, we're also seeing very robust growth in that initial time point for new patients coming in. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, last quarter, we had 25% of U.S. oncologists to order the product. And I think that's really incredible based on where we are now. And I think that's going to continue to get better over time. So as more patients shifting to recurrence monitoring as we start to get commercial coverage, as we start to get a broader array of coverage beyond colorectal, IO and bladder. I mean, all of these things can have a positive impact on ASP. So Mike, do you want to touch maybe briefly just on some of the ASP trends and then on \u201823.\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. Thanks, Steve. And thanks, Puneet. Just to level set, like where we've been and where we're going on Signatera ASPs, we started last year with the $500 on ASP and we've rapidly grown that ASP as we've gotten coverage for Medicare and the mix shift has continued to improve, both in terms of mix of Medicare reimbursed CRC patients and also a steadily improving mix recurrence monitoring patients as well. I think that mix shift is something that's a pretty durable trend into next year. So we exit 2022 in that mid-$700 range. I think there's room to grow another $50 to $100, just purely on the mix shift dynamics alone. And then beyond that, Solomon touched on, the favorable reimbursement we've now formally secured in terms of pricing on immunotherapy response monitoring. So we'll start to build out those claims as well. And then we've got a lot of opportunities to significantly broaden reimbursement both in terms of, for example, breast cancer reimbursement for Medicare's a possibility as a broader commercial reimbursement in colorectal cancer. So a lot of really positive drivers that I see as kind of multiyear drivers for the ASP.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the early screening programs, Steve, I mean, I appreciate the RS data and the FDA discussions which you've had. But this market already has two liquid competitors. There's this tool competitor that could also launch a liquid test. And so just help us think about how do you want to position in this market. And obviously, that -- my assumption is that, that will involve addition to cash burn. So what does that mean for then for 2023 when you are expect to moderate that cash burn in \u201923. So just walk us through how that's going to happen. So thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, thanks. So I think, look, we've been in a position before where we're not the first entrant into the market. And I think we did really well in that position. I think there's an opportunity, I think, now to kind of take a step back and look at the landscape and what's happening as different products get commercialized and then tailor our launch strategy to that. And that includes I think some things on tailoring the road map and sort of doing the design in a way to pick up certain aspects of the detection that I think would be important. So in some ways, there's an advantage to being in the position that we're in. I\u2019ll also just sort of reiterate, we do have a big one sales team. I think somewhere kind of in the range, commercial team members all in, I don't know, maybe 300 people or something like that. So we're covering a broad swath of the primary care practices, because most women see their OB-GYN for primary care. We think that's an opportunity for us as we look to commercialize product in the future. But when it comes to kind of figuring out the trial plan and the opportunity for us there and which path we're going to have to go down we've already gotten that sort of built in to our budget plans over the next couple of years. So when Mike and I talk about a path to cash flow breakeven that had a very significant reduction in \u201923 that includes the necessary spending on the clinical trial that we think we may end up ultimately having to do in early cancer detection. So we've already been built in. And I think we -- you just have to kind of stay tuned to the data as it reads out, and we'll go from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening. So sticking on the cash burn theme there, Steve, just beyond the pan-cancer push for Signatera and the bets you laid out in oncology here on this slide. Is there anything else we need to be keeping in mind? And how are you thinking about that mid-\u201824 sort of breakeven time line? Is there any sort of like slippage there? Or do you still feel really confident that you can hit mid-\u201824 for breakeven?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So maybe let me make a couple of comments and then I'll turn it over to Mike. And as I'd say, first, when you look at the projects that we have to get executed, to get to cash flow breakeven, I think, first of all, we're taking cost management very seriously. I think many of you saw we recently had a workforce reduction, probably about 115 people. And we've looked at ways to create synergies across the business by integrating the Empower sales team with the Signatera sales team. So we're taking this initiative very seriously. We also have many COGS reduction projects that includes things like building out new lab capacity in Austin that includes things like moving to more higher throughput, lower cost sequencers. So these are projects that aren't difficult to do, they just have to be done. And they just take manpower and time and planning development work to get done. So we could see that path pretty clearly ahead of us. Then there's the execution on the ASP, there's things like getting more indications covered for Signatera, getting commercial coverage for some of the colorectal tests that includes improving ASP coverage in other areas of the business. So as all these things come together, there\u2019s obviously some puts and takes, and there are some things that are directly within our control and there are some things that are a little less within our control, what we've set up, I think, nicely for. And when you put all that together, I think we expect to see a very significant reduction in cash burn in \u201823, followed by a very clear path to cash flow breakeven. We do think that, that 2024 time line is achievable. I think mid-\u201824 is achievable and we're putting all these pieces together and kind of seeing where we hit on that road map. If we did get in a position where we wanted to accelerate things, there's a lot of levers that we can pull some of the big bets, I think they that Solomon outlined. I mean look, we're doing a lot of things that cost a lot of money, because we think they're important for the future of the business. Now if we said, look, we want to pull in getting cash flow breakeven by one quarter or by two quarters. We could pull a bunch of levers and we can do that very quickly, but we don't think that's the right move necessarily. We think being prudent sticking to the plan, executing the COGS, executing the ASP, keeping the expenses relatively flat is the right strategy, and it's good that we're seeing this line of sight in our model clearly at this stage. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMichael Brophy: No, that was quite comprehensive. Thanks, Steve.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then one on Signatera for me. Steve, can you give us a sense of, 185,000 tests that you hope to do this year. How are you thinking about the fraction that you anticipate sort of getting paid on at the moment? Obviously, it's going to go up as reimbursement broadens and you submit these -- the prior claims to Medicare as well. So curious on that bit. And then on the NCCN process, given that you have this Nature Medicine paper here, are you still feeling good about the sort of April, May time frame next for guideline inclusion. And do you think it should be a relatively straightforward process now that you have this marquee publication out there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So maybe let me comment on NCCN. And then Mike or Solomon, you guys can talk a little bit about sort of the mix that we're seeing between covered and non-covered indications. So on NCCN, I think we all know that they sort of met in August. We haven't seen the readout from that meeting. We think it will come out in the near future. But I think the unfortunate part was that the circulate paper wasn't included, obviously, because it wasn't accepted and pure reviewed at that stage. So now that it has been accepted in Nature Medicine, which is one of the highest impact journals in existence in the entire field of medicine, I think that being very prominently featured. I think we'll obviously allow that to be included in future reviews of the guidelines. So we just kind of have to see how things go. But I think the results of the August meeting, just unfortunately are going to be including that publication in a significant way. I do think there's line of sight as we turn the corner into next year, but we really just have to kind of see how things pan out. Then one, I think, really big upside surprise that was a big win for us was to see these Japanese society and medical oncology guidelines come out. I think this is a great step forward to see a national guideline like this be formally put in place. And obviously, I think it's something that committee members around the world will be looking at. And I think that's a great step forward. And I think there's a positive read-through there as we look for the future of MRD testing. Mike, Solomon, do you want to cover kind of what we're seeing from a indication mix, which we covered and non-covered?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. So I think that the overall mix is roughly stable to what we've talked about previously. I mean, I think there's kind of some modest improvement that we are glad to see on a sequential basis. So what that means is roughly half of the volumes are falling into indications where we have a Medicare coverage. Now, that doesn't mean that half of the volumes are reimbursed, because not all of those patients are obviously Medicare patients. For example, what we're seeing in the colorectal cancer indication is something like high-30s percent of those people are actually Medicare reimbursed patients. And we've seen some really nice progression there from the low-30s to the high-30s over the last year. I think there's potential scope for our Medicare mix within colorectal cancer to continue to improve. So that's one way to think about mix and the way to think about mix is upfront testing versus serial monitoring, and that's progressing really nicely, perhaps as you'd expect. We had a really strong launch year where a lot of people got their initial Signatera tests and set up last year and then they're coming back, they're staying on protocol and getting repeat monitoring tests. And so that mix continues to improve in our favor. So that's kind of a high-level view of the mix, and those trends are modestly above, I think, where we would have hoped to be at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Masucci with Cowen.\nMax Masucci: Hey, thanks fior taking the questions. First one, just curious, what are the key time lines or checkpoints that we should keep on our radar for the build-out, the refresh of your internal sequencing infrastructure and capabilities. And I'm curious if the mid-2024 profitability target assumes that the updated or enhanced infrastructure is in place or if you're still outsourcing a bit?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So let me comment there first and then we can open it up further. So there are several projects that we have right now that include both, kind of, scaling up our lab infrastructure, particularly, I think, our tissue infrastructure and then also moving up to more high throughput, scalable sequencers for Panorama. For example, there we're still wanting despite the number of Panorama tests we're doing, we're still running on the next seat. So advancing the sequencing system there, obviously, is a pretty straightforward project. There's other areas where we have significant COGS reduction opportunities in the range of $20 million plus per project. Now the vast majority of these are in progress right now and are going to be the primary projects that we work on throughout \u201923 along with several technology advancement opportunities. Actually, we've got some really exciting stuff coming as well. It's not just COGS reduction. There's some really, I think, cool technology advancements that we're working on as well. But I would say these things will, kind of, come in more towards the end of \u201823 and as we kind of turn the corner and then in the beginning of \u201824, just given the scale and the size of some of these projects. Now some of them are, kind of, hitting right now and will be phased in throughout the course of \u201823 and get up to full capacity by the end of \u201823. But then many of the other ones will, sort of, hit in that kind of late \u201823, early \u201824 time frame. Mike, do you want to add anything further to that?\nMichael Brophy: No, I think that covers it.\nOperator: One moment. Your next question comes from the line of Julia Qin with JPMorgan.\nJulia Qin: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. So on cancer screening, you know that the two potential FDA approval pathways. Could you talk about kind of the pros and cons for each and what the product's competitive positioning would be under each pathway? Obviously, the two scenarios would have very different cash burn implications as well? So when you said earlier that your current cash flow expectation already fully invest that investment, are you referring to the more cost-efficient scenario using the oral health data with those market studies? Or are you embedding a potential need for a prospective trial before the product launch? And how should we think about the general time frame on that side?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks for asking further there. So I think from a -- look, from a positioning standpoint, it's always been our focus to lead with technology and lead with performance. And that's what our goal is here as well. As I mentioned, we have an opportunity to kind of take a step back and see what's important, adenomas, for example, that maybe if those that started the development multiple, multiple years ago, didn't really kind of have that opportunity to kind of take a step back. So we're designing our product in a way that I think leverages the strength of our core technology and the capabilities that we have, but also what we know about how the market is developing. And then also the unique data that we have access to. Now we have 50 plus thousand tumor exons that we ran uniquely early-stage tumor excellence that we can leverage as far as mining data and understanding what's important. So we think leading with technology and leading with performance is always a great way to go. Of course, COGS and distribution is also important to him, and we'll be focusing on that very clearly. So when we look at the different pathways, I think that one pathway of running the oral health samples as the FDA validation study and then doing the post-market surveillance study or the other is running oral health as sort of an initial validation and then doing the prospective FDA level study. Actually, the cost associated with both of those, we think, will be roughly about the same. I think in both cases, we'd be enrolling kind of similar number of patients and we expect the enrollment to take kind of a similar amount of time. And actually, I think as we start to kind of look at the landscape and some of the newer ways of doing studies, there's been some companies recently that have done prospective trials in the range of 10,000 patients that are, sort of, matched with gold standard colonoscopy and they've executed those studies in the range of, kind of, $15 million to $20 million and took in the range of kind of one year. So I think there's some newer designs and newer ways to do studies that we intend to, kind of, leverage some of these newer trends, and we think we can do it in a pretty expedited manner in a pretty cost-effective manner. But either way, it's going to cost us kind of roughly the same amount.\nJulia Qin: Got you. That's very helpful. And then another one on Signatera, does your current guidance assume any meaningful contribution from the VA contract and the IO monitoring reimbursement? And if not, it's still how much? And how should we think about the magnitude of those incremental revenues going forward in \u201823?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I'll just mentioned briefly, we do include IO monitoring, that's something that although we just got the pricing in. And I think, obviously, there's actually some upside in the pricing versus what we had initially expected. I think there's some -- I think that is generally part of our guidance, and we're seeing good growth there. The VA is really a new win. And this is something that I think does represent upside. It's not something we had kind of plugged in Solomon, do you want to talk about the VA and kind of what our expectations are there?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. So we're really excited about working with the Veterans Administration. This was a public RFP process that was initiated earlier in the year. It was a competitive process that Natera was selected through. The process was narrowed to only labs, who had a tumor-informed test were eligible, which I think was a good signal of kind of where the market is going with its perception of tumor-informed testing as the standard -- as the emerging standard-of-care. And so we were selected for this contract. It is sort of as many testing contracts with the VA have gone, it's an initial step. It's in the range of $5 million to $10 million in size, and we expect that Natera is going to provide great service as we have to our other customers and that that's going to lead to re-up opportunities in the future. The contract does cover serial testing. And it is pan cancer in nature. However, we do expect the initial rollout to be heavy on colorectal cancer, as we've seen with many of our other customers. And I think the VA is an important example of strategic account adoption that we're seeing with many other leading large oncology groups around the country and I think it's going to contribute to our -- achieving the mission and to our first-mover advantage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. First, for the IO $7,500 pricing, how many tests on average are you seeing in that bundle as we try to think about the impact there? And then can you just give an update on where Signatera COGS stand today and the path forward for that?\nSteve Chapman: Solomon, do you want to take the first one?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Yes. I don't think we've previously talked about average number of tests per patient, but what I can say is that the pricing for that service does reflect an expected higher testing frequency and slightly longer time frame on average than what you would see with the service that was priced for patients with colorectal cancer, for example, for Signatera, where the pricing was just under $6,000. So that's what the pricing did reflect. Now I think we'll -- when we're announcing more information, more granular data about average test per patient and then we will be able to give more detail on that.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Let me comment on the COGS question. So just on a blended basis, our COGS, again, just a level set. Historically, we had COGS upwards of $600 on a blended basis per unit that's dropped down through the course of \u201822 to now that's kind of in the low to mid-$500s here in Q3 and expected in Q4. And then based on some of the improvement projects and in-house projects that Steve was -- we're seeing earlier in the Q&A, we think that can drop down below -- lower again to below $500 on a blended basis per unit next year and just going to continue to get lower as your mix continues to shift towards repeat monitoring, and we just continue to get more efficient.\nCatherine Schulte: Got it. And then for the California NIPT program, if it turns out that, that program is not allowed to stand, are you locked into your pricing with the state? Or is that something you can renegotiate?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Let me kind of talk on that. So I think the program, the way was kind of initially devised, there was an RFP process, and we were selected, I think a lot of companies applied and they all had to make decisions about what they thought was best for them. But in the end, it was Austin and Quest, we're the only ones really allowed to offer NIPT testing in the state. We thought that, that would be, I think, okay, given that we're taking a lower price and we're expanding the volume and there's some opportunities to cross-sell other products. So we decided to go ahead and participate. Now obviously, it's a lower margin opportunity. It wasn't ideal, but we decided to kind of go ahead with it because we thought it was important to be in California. Now with this recent legal happening where there's an injunction that's been given against the program that prevents them from, kind of, implementing certain aspects of the program. I think it's not clear exactly we're still, kind of, understanding what that means. So that I think one of the likely path is that we kind of go back to the way things were. And that's, I think, frankly, a positive for us. But we're also fine being in the program. So I think we just have to kind of see how things pan out. For us modeling goes, we've obviously been very conservative in our guidance both for the, kind of, rest of the year and as we turn the corner into \u201823, assuming, sort of, the worst-case scenario. So any improvement to that worst-case scenario would be upside.\nCatherine Schulte: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the allotted time for questions. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Today I will touch on some of the key drivers of our commercial success in Oncology; highlights from our clinical data pipeline; and I'll dive a bit deeper on the key investments that we're making for the future. Steve described the incredible growth that we've observed with the Signatera MRD test. As a reminder, this personalized tumor-informed test has been shown to detect cancer recurrence in many months earlier than standard diagnostic imaging. It can help inform treatment decisions and monitoring the quantitative dynamics to help identify early whether a treatment is effective. The product has been very sticky for both physicians and patients with high rates of repeat testing. We believe our commercial success is attributable to four key strengths. First, we have a large industry-leading team of tenured sales professionals, and we combine that with a team of more than 50 in medical and scientific affairs, including four board-certified physicians, who've practiced oncology. This team is calling on oncologists and surgeons, and we've recently started to gain momentum with large strategic accounts around the country, including the VA and other leading groups. We are really very proud to have been selected as a partner to the veteran community, especially heading into Veterans Day later this week. Number two, our market access team has a strong track record of execution with MolDX, as we've repeatedly secured both coverage and good pricing. For example, our colorectal coverage includes both adjuvant and recurrence monitoring, rather than being limited to just adjuvant. In bladder, it includes neoadjuvant, adjuvant and recurrence monitoring. We think these distinctions are important and are a competitive advantage. On pricing, we've received ADLT status, which is hard for other MRD labs to replicate. And the pricing we've secured this past quarter for the IO monitoring service is at $7,489 per patient. Number three, strong user experience with mobile phlebotomy, physician portals, fast turnaround times and electronic medical record integration. For example, our national partnership with Epic, where access to Signatera is already pre-installed in the latest version of their EMR software, this experience is further enhanced by our portfolio of oncology tests. For example, Signatera and Altera testing from the same tumor and blood specimens. We're always striving to get better. With this infrastructure in place, we believe that we're poised to scale quickly and sustainably as we prepare for several key milestones ahead, including potential inclusion into the NCCN guidelines, expansion of coverage by Medicare and private payers and readout of several key clinical studies. And that's the fourth major advantage, our data leadership. Given the significant time it takes to collect longitudinal samples and gather long-term clinical follow-up, this may be one of the biggest advantages that we have. I'm very proud of the execution of our team, which includes 13 peer-reviewed publications thus far in 2022 and 35 overall across more than two dozen different cancer types. We have 10 additional manuscripts in submission right now, so our evidence generation continues to move at a rapid pace. In the past three months, we published our clinical validation study in ovarian cancer, a Phase 2 study in uveal melanoma, and we had two oral presentations at the European Society for Medical Oncology Conference in Paris in colorectal and breast cancers. Touching on a few highlights here. In the multi-site ovarian study, we analyzed 163 samples from 69 patients. And with serial testing, Signatera detected recurrence with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with an average lead time of 10-months versus standard imaging. There are approximately 20,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed each year in the U.S., and we believe Signatera can help inform treatment decisions for many of those patients. In early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, the BELLINI study presented at ESMO demonstrated the power of monitoring ctDNA dynamics with Signatera during neoadjuvant immunotherapy. This builds upon the significant base of evidence that Natera is already developing in breast cancer, with published studies from the I-SPY2 consortia in the neoadjuvant setting, and the University of Leicester in the adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings, plus additional manuscripts already submitted for publication, plus the ongoing Phase 3 trial in triple-negative and BRCA-mutated breast cancer, plus the additional studies in the pipeline, which have not yet been announced. We are deeply committed to proving the utility of Signatera for patients with breast cancer. Finally, in colorectal cancer, leading GI oncologists presented real-world data from over 16,000 Signatera patients with Stage 1 to 3 disease at ESMO. The results were in line with prior evidence, showing that MRD-negative patients showed no significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. This will be submitted for publication in the near future and will be a great addition to the existing body of evidence. This sets the stage for our next major readout from the CIRCULATE consortium, with clinical follow-up now extended to 18-months, which has been formally accepted for publication by Nature Medicine. And in GI cancers beyond CRC, we had another validation study recently accepted for publication in gastroesophageal cancer, coming from a multi-site real-world study with over 900 plasma samples collected from over 200 patients. We believe this is going to pave the way for Signatera to help inform management in this challenging disease, which is the sixth most common type of cancer in the U.S., affecting approximately 47,000 new patients per year. This one is somewhat personal for me as we lost my father to esophageal cancer last year. Additionally, we were pleased to see a recently revised practice guideline from the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, JSMO, providing what appears to be a strong recommendation for the use of serial MRD testing in colorectal cancer. We think this is a great step forward for MRD. This clinical evidence often drives payer coverage directly or in some cases, it generates data that's required to inform the design of definitive Phase 3 trials. At some point in the coming years, we believe there will be an inflection point where Signatera will be fully adopted and reimbursed in pan-cancer fashion, much like CT scans, without the need for separate trials in each indication. But we are not quite there yet. Our current approved indications in colorectal, bladder and immunotherapy response monitoring represent an estimated addressable market of up to 2.5 million tests per year at full penetration, giving our commercial team plenty to do as we work to expand coverage even further. Finally, to achieve our long-term vision, we are making several substantial investments in the business. Number one, we're expecting and processing tests ahead of reimbursement and expanding our footprint and lab staff. This sets us up to be in an excellent position in the future where we're already scaled for success. Number two, we are investing heavily in clinical trials to establish pan-cancer clinical and economic utility for Signatera. Number three, in addition to the current LDT version of Signatera, we're developing an IVD version of the product. This is to support global expansion into Japan and Europe, which require regulatory approval in order to gain market access, and approval by the FDA as a companion diagnostic and eventually, as a surrogate endpoint. Number four, we're expanding our menu and expect to add a liquid biopsy therapy selection assay to the product menu in the future in addition to what we think is a promising early cancer detection program. Plus, we're advancing the Signatera technology, which we think is going to pay dividends in the future. Finally, we're building out a promising new data service. Several of our research partners have already started to access our real-world database with its unique combination of tumor and germline exome data, with serial ctDNA dynamics and clinical outcomes, which together can generate novel insights to inform the development of new therapies and new biomarkers. By the end of this year, we expect to have run over 250,000 cumulative Signatera tests. So it's not unrealistic to think in the future, we will have over a million Signatera test data points in our database, which we think creates a great opportunity. Although these are capital-intensive investments, we think they're the right things to do for the long-term future of the business. Now I'd like to hand over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. So we're really excited about working with the Veterans Administration. This was a public RFP process that was initiated earlier in the year. It was a competitive process that Natera was selected through. The process was narrowed to only labs, who had a tumor-informed test were eligible, which I think was a good signal of kind of where the market is going with its perception of tumor-informed testing as the standard -- as the emerging standard-of-care. And so we were selected for this contract. It is sort of as many testing contracts with the VA have gone, it's an initial step. It's in the range of $5 million to $10 million in size, and we expect that Natera is going to provide great service as we have to our other customers and that that's going to lead to re-up opportunities in the future. The contract does cover serial testing. And it is pan cancer in nature. However, we do expect the initial rollout to be heavy on colorectal cancer, as we've seen with many of our other customers. And I think the VA is an important example of strategic account adoption that we're seeing with many other leading large oncology groups around the country and I think it's going to contribute to our -- achieving the mission and to our first-mover advantage.

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Let's start with our Q3 highlights. As you can see from the press release, we had another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew approximately 33% over Q3 last year and we processed 518,000 tests this quarter growing 27% year-over-year. We're seeing strong momentum across all product lines and I'll spend more time on that in a moment. We are pleased to be able to once again raise our 2022 guidance to $810 million to $830 million. At the midpoint, this represents an increase in our revenue guidance by over $40 million, compared to our initial guide in March and this new range implies annual revenue growth of 37%, excluding the one-time QIAGEN milestone in 2021 of $29 million. We are exercising caution in forecasting some of the early results from the launch of the California prenatal screening program. There have been a few legal developments with the program in the last few days and we are evaluating the impact. But for now, we are being careful with our forecast. In addition, we've recently integrated our Empower and Signatera sales teams to focus on centers where both Signatera and Empower in demand. I'll get to the expected benefits of that move later, but we are being cautious with the guide to account for the disruption in the immediate term. One of the key reasons for the revenue raise is the strong momentum we are seeing with Signatera, which is performing well above our internal volume forecast for the year. We processed roughly 132,000 oncology tests this year, and we think we are on track for roughly 175,000 units this year. We will expand on our Signatera volumes further in a moment. The breadth and depth of our data generation for Signatera across multiple tumor types is a key competitive advantage over others in this space. In fact, we now have 35 peer-reviewed published studies, with 13 publications so far in 2022 and several more coming soon. We were pleased to publish our first validation study in ovarian cancer in the Journal of Gynecological Oncology. In addition, our large-scale gastroesophageal validation study, which includes over 900 timepoints, was just accepted in JCO Precision Oncology. Finally, we are pleased to announce that the CIRCULATE study, now with 18 months of median follow-up, has been accepted in Nature Medicine, which has an impact factor of 87. And we look forward to its publication shortly. Our Organ Health products were a strong contributor to both volume and revenue growth this quarter. We announced the second publication from the Trifecta study in Transplantation. This publication demonstrated our Prospera Kidney test was superior to the current standard-of-care donor-specific antibody in predicting antibody-mediated rejection. I'll spend more time on this data in a few moments. Finally, we are pleased to share that an independent committee of our Board of Directors has completed a detailed independent investigation into the allegations made in the March short seller report. The Board was assisted in this matter by WilmerHale, which as you know is a leading international law firm with deep experience in investigations like this. The WilmerHale team had access to company executives, personnel, communications and other company records. Based on the investigation, the independent committee, on behalf of the Board, has concluded that the allegations of wrongdoing against the company in the report were unfounded. We weren't surprised with the findings. As you recall, we had a very detailed response and open Q&A the next morning where we reiterated the strength of our compliance program. And following that call, based on our confidence in the company and the belief in our compliance program, members of the executive team bought stock and took salary in the form of equity for the remainder of 2022. It's great to have this investigation completed as it involved a substantial amount of time and energy from our team to support the activity on the outside law firm, but we were happy to do the additional work to respond to all of their requests. Of course, given the high profile nature of that short report and some of the accusations made about the NIPT space in the January New York Times article, we weren't surprised to receive inquiries from regulators, which we have responded to. There have been no specific claims or allegations made, just a customarily broad request you would expect. As we said from the outset, we feel we have a very strong compliance program in place, and I think wrapping up the Independent Board investigation, which involved a detailed review of the allegations and found no wrongdoing by the company, represents an important milestone. Okay, great. Let's get into more of the detailed business trends on the next slide. As I mentioned, volumes grew rapidly once again in Q3. As a reminder, in Q3 of 2021, we got a big one-time bump from a key competitor leaving the market, so despite that big base of volumes, we continued to deliver rapid growth. The Women's Health business continues to expand and we continue to get balanced contributions from NIPT market expansion and competitive wins. I'm not going to go into detail on Women's Health on the call today, so I'll just spend a moment on that opportunity. First, we think the NIPT market is only about 45% to 50% penetrated, so there's still a large opportunity to help more patients. Second, we think Natera is well positioned going forward, given our clinical differentiation and our leadership in peer-reviewed evidence, including the SMART trial, which is the largest prospective trial ever done looking at both common80-20s and the 22q microdeletion. Finally, we think it's possible there may be some critical milestone opportunities ahead where societies may advocate for expansion of prenatal genetic testing. So there's a lot of great things happening behind the scenes. Okay, back to volumes. In addition to our Women's Health growth, the Prospera transplant test continues to ramp significantly in kidney, and we are now also seeing traction in heart and lung transplants. The positive volumes in heart and lung are leading indicators that they aren't yet contributing to revenues, and we are working to get reimbursement in those segments in the future. Finally, our largest contributor to volume growth has been the increase we've seen in Signatera clinical volumes. The next slide gives you detailed historical snapshot of the traction we're seeing with Signatera. In Q3 of 2022, we performed 53,000 Signatera and Altera tests, representing growth of 153% year-over-year. For 2022, we expect to perform 175,000 Signatera and Altera tests for growth of approximately 130%. The volume growth at this stage is coming from both increases in repeat ordering from the base of patients that started with Signatera previously, and a rapid increase in the number of oncologists that are ordering Signatera and adding new patients. For example, we estimate that roughly 25% of the 12,000 community oncologists in the United States have ordered a Signatera test in the past quarter. I think that's a strong testament to how quickly we think Signatera is becoming integrated into the standard-of-care. A little more than half of these volumes are Medicare reimbursed indications like colorectal cancer and IO monitoring, and a significant chunk of the remaining volume is in indications where we have strong data and are actively pursuing Medicare reimbursement. We had previously committed to breaking out these volumes annually, but I wanted to share these numbers a quarter early, because this slide is important to understanding our growth strategy of Signatera. Given the volume and the reimbursement traction we are seeing, we think it's clearly the right strategy to continue to establish Signatera as a standard-of-care for MRD and recurrence monitoring, even if the unreimbursed volume growth pressures our margins in the immediate term. Mike will get into our guidance later in the call, but the rapid growth in Signatera volumes, particularly in the areas that aren't reimbursed today, but we believe we have a near-term opportunity for coverage, is one of the reasons we're increasing the cash burn forecast for 2022. We continue to expect a major reduction in cash flow in 2023, followed by a path to cash flow breakeven, even with the rapid increase in Signatera non-covered indications that we are seeing now. This next slide shows you that volume growth is translating into revenue growth. Total revenue growth of $210 million increased 33%, which is a larger increase in our volume growth of 27%. As critical to Signatera volumes growth, the ASP progression is particularly important to the overall model. Clinical Signatera ASPs continued to increase from about $500 last year to over $700 last quarter, and are now over $750 in Q3. We believe our ASPs will continue to improve, driven by greater coverage. And in the near-term, the mix of Medicare reimbursed tests is improving, and an increasing proportion of our volumes are starting to come from the recurrence monitoring indication, which is reimbursed by Medicare at the ADLT rate of $3,900. In transplant, we are seeing some limited pressure on ASPs as we see the mix shift to currently uncovered heart and lung tests, although we've submitted for coverage for both of those indications. In kidney we haven't been impacted by Medicare Advantage or commercial mix shift as our payer mix has remained stable and we've always incorporated those factors into our ASP. In addition, we've seen some pressure on germline ASPs, but there's a handful of opportunities we're working, including possibly gaining increased coverage with forthcoming guidelines. In Organ Health, we continued to make progress on several key initiatives. We now have a significant volume of peer-reviewed data across kidney, heart and lung indications. In fact, we published 13 publications in the past 12 months alone. I'm going to highlight on the slide here our second publication from the Trifecta study. The study demonstrated that donor-derived cell-free DNA testing was superior to the standard-of-care donor-specific antigen. Both components of Prospera's algorithm, donor-derived cell-free DNA fraction and estimated quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA, outperform DSA and predict the AMR with an AUC of 0.84 and 0.85 versus the current standard-of-care having an AUC of 0.66. We expect the continued drumbeat of strong data across our Organ Health franchise to continue in 2023. We're very pleased with how we're doing and of the great work our team has done to help physicians and patients. Now before I turn it over to Solomon to discuss Oncology, I want to talk about our early cancer detection efforts. We continue the development of our DNA methylation platform from both colorectal and multi-cancer early detection products. We remain on track to present initial case-control performance data for our CRC ECD assay in 2023. On the regulatory front, we continue our discussions with the FDA and are hoping to receive final feedback in 2023. During our first pre-submission meeting, we had a productive discussion with the FDA with two pathways emerging. The first path includes using the oral health samples for the FDA validation study, followed by a post-market surveillance study. The second path could use the oral health study for the initial validation, while we're conducting a new prospective study for the FDA. While we await the final feedback from the FDA, we are finalizing the design for either option. We are excited to provide additional information about our ECD program in 2023. With that, I will now turn it over to Solomon to review our Oncology results in more detail. Solomon? Yeah. Thanks, operator. Just one quick clarification, so earlier in the call on the prepared remarks, I said that we expect to do about 175,000 Signatera tests this year. It was actually meant to be greater than 185,000. And I just want to reiterate that we're expecting to see robust quarter-on-quarter growth between Q3 and Q4 in Signatera. Thank you. Let's open it up for questions. Yes. So let me make a couple of comments, and then I think Mike you can dig into the ASP and, I think \u201823 growth trends. But I'll just say, first of all, we're obviously very pleased with the rapid growth and the uptake that we've seen both in colorectal and then in indications beyond colorectal. And we think this is just the beginning. I mean, if you look at the momentum that we have, I think we're really building a great flywheel here, especially with the data. So we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And we certainly are seeing a shift over time into that recurrence monitoring indication as you'd expect, it's more and more patients come into the pipeline. But at the same time, we're also seeing very robust growth in that initial time point for new patients coming in. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, last quarter, we had 25% of U.S. oncologists to order the product. And I think that's really incredible based on where we are now. And I think that's going to continue to get better over time. So as more patients shifting to recurrence monitoring as we start to get commercial coverage, as we start to get a broader array of coverage beyond colorectal, IO and bladder. I mean, all of these things can have a positive impact on ASP. So Mike, do you want to touch maybe briefly just on some of the ASP trends and then on \u201823. Yes, thanks. So I think, look, we've been in a position before where we're not the first entrant into the market. And I think we did really well in that position. I think there's an opportunity, I think, now to kind of take a step back and look at the landscape and what's happening as different products get commercialized and then tailor our launch strategy to that. And that includes I think some things on tailoring the road map and sort of doing the design in a way to pick up certain aspects of the detection that I think would be important. So in some ways, there's an advantage to being in the position that we're in. I'll also just sort of reiterate, we do have a big one sales team. I think somewhere kind of in the range, commercial team members all in, I don't know, maybe 300 people or something like that. So we're covering a broad swath of the primary care practices, because most women see their OB-GYN for primary care. We think that's an opportunity for us as we look to commercialize product in the future. But when it comes to kind of figuring out the trial plan and the opportunity for us there and which path we're going to have to go down we've already gotten that sort of built in to our budget plans over the next couple of years. So when Mike and I talk about a path to cash flow breakeven that had a very significant reduction in '23 that includes the necessary spending on the clinical trial that we think we may end up ultimately having to do in early cancer detection. So we've already been built in. And I think we -- you just have to kind of stay tuned to the data as it reads out, and we'll go from there. Yes. So maybe let me make a couple of comments and then I'll turn it over to Mike. And as I'd say, first, when you look at the projects that we have to get executed, to get to cash flow breakeven, I think, first of all, we're taking cost management very seriously. I think many of you saw we recently had a workforce reduction, probably about 115 people. And we've looked at ways to create synergies across the business by integrating the Empower sales team with the Signatera sales team. So we're taking this initiative very seriously. We also have many COGS reduction projects that includes things like building out new lab capacity in Austin that includes things like moving to more higher throughput, lower cost sequencers. So these are projects that aren't difficult to do, they just have to be done. And they just take manpower and time and planning development work to get done. So we could see that path pretty clearly ahead of us. Then there's the execution on the ASP, there's things like getting more indications covered for Signatera, getting commercial coverage for some of the colorectal tests that includes improving ASP coverage in other areas of the business. So as all these things come together, there's obviously some puts and takes, and there are some things that are directly within our control and there are some things that are a little less within our control, what we've set up, I think, nicely for. And when you put all that together, I think we expect to see a very significant reduction in cash burn in \u201823, followed by a very clear path to cash flow breakeven. We do think that, that 2024 time line is achievable. I think mid-\u201824 is achievable and we're putting all these pieces together and kind of seeing where we hit on that road map. If we did get in a position where we wanted to accelerate things, there's a lot of levers that we can pull some of the big bets, I think they that Solomon outlined. I mean look, we're doing a lot of things that cost a lot of money, because we think they're important for the future of the business. Now if we said, look, we want to pull in getting cash flow breakeven by one quarter or by two quarters. We could pull a bunch of levers and we can do that very quickly, but we don't think that's the right move necessarily. We think being prudent sticking to the plan, executing the COGS, executing the ASP, keeping the expenses relatively flat is the right strategy, and it's good that we're seeing this line of sight in our model clearly at this stage. Mike, do you want to add anything? Yes. So maybe let me comment on NCCN. And then Mike or Solomon, you guys can talk a little bit about sort of the mix that we're seeing between covered and non-covered indications. So on NCCN, I think we all know that they sort of met in August. We haven't seen the readout from that meeting. We think it will come out in the near future. But I think the unfortunate part was that the circulate paper wasn't included, obviously, because it wasn't accepted and pure reviewed at that stage. So now that it has been accepted in Nature Medicine, which is one of the highest impact journals in existence in the entire field of medicine, I think that being very prominently featured. I think we'll obviously allow that to be included in future reviews of the guidelines. So we just kind of have to see how things go. But I think the results of the August meeting, just unfortunately are going to be including that publication in a significant way. I do think there's line of sight as we turn the corner into next year, but we really just have to kind of see how things pan out. Then one, I think, really big upside surprise that was a big win for us was to see these Japanese society and medical oncology guidelines come out. I think this is a great step forward to see a national guideline like this be formally put in place. And obviously, I think it's something that committee members around the world will be looking at. And I think that's a great step forward. And I think there's a positive read-through there as we look for the future of MRD testing. Mike, Solomon, do you want to cover kind of what we're seeing from a indication mix, which we covered and non-covered? Yes. So let me comment there first and then we can open it up further. So there are several projects that we have right now that include both, kind of, scaling up our lab infrastructure, particularly, I think, our tissue infrastructure and then also moving up to more high throughput, scalable sequencers for Panorama. For example, there we're still wanting despite the number of Panorama tests we're doing, we're still running on the next seat. So advancing the sequencing system there, obviously, is a pretty straightforward project. There's other areas where we have significant COGS reduction opportunities in the range of $20 million plus per project. Now the vast majority of these are in progress right now and are going to be the primary projects that we work on throughout '23 along with several technology advancement opportunities. Actually, we've got some really exciting stuff coming as well. It's not just COGS reduction. There's some really, I think, cool technology advancements that we're working on as well. But I would say these things will, kind of, come in more towards the end of \u201823 and as we kind of turn the corner and then in the beginning of \u201824, just given the scale and the size of some of these projects. Now some of them are, kind of, hitting right now and will be phased in throughout the course of \u201823 and get up to full capacity by the end of \u201823. But then many of the other ones will, sort of, hit in that kind of late \u201823, early \u201824 time frame. Mike, do you want to add anything further to that? Yes. Thanks for asking further there. So I think from a -- look, from a positioning standpoint, it's always been our focus to lead with technology and lead with performance. And that's what our goal is here as well. As I mentioned, we have an opportunity to kind of take a step back and see what's important, adenomas, for example, that maybe if those that started the development multiple, multiple years ago, didn't really kind of have that opportunity to kind of take a step back. So we're designing our product in a way that I think leverages the strength of our core technology and the capabilities that we have, but also what we know about how the market is developing. And then also the unique data that we have access to. Now we have 50 plus thousand tumor exons that we ran uniquely early-stage tumor excellence that we can leverage as far as mining data and understanding what's important. So we think leading with technology and leading with performance is always a great way to go. Of course, COGS and distribution is also important to him, and we'll be focusing on that very clearly. So when we look at the different pathways, I think that one pathway of running the oral health samples as the FDA validation study and then doing the post-market surveillance study or the other is running oral health as sort of an initial validation and then doing the prospective FDA level study. Actually, the cost associated with both of those, we think, will be roughly about the same. I think in both cases, we'd be enrolling kind of similar number of patients and we expect the enrollment to take kind of a similar amount of time. And actually, I think as we start to kind of look at the landscape and some of the newer ways of doing studies, there's been some companies recently that have done prospective trials in the range of 10,000 patients that are, sort of, matched with gold standard colonoscopy and they've executed those studies in the range of, kind of, $15 million to $20 million and took in the range of kind of one year. So I think there's some newer designs and newer ways to do studies that we intend to, kind of, leverage some of these newer trends, and we think we can do it in a pretty expedited manner in a pretty cost-effective manner. But either way, it's going to cost us kind of roughly the same amount. Yes. So I'll just mentioned briefly, we do include IO monitoring, that's something that although we just got the pricing in. And I think, obviously, there's actually some upside in the pricing versus what we had initially expected. I think there's some -- I think that is generally part of our guidance, and we're seeing good growth there. The VA is really a new win. And this is something that I think does represent upside. It's not something we had kind of plugged in Solomon, do you want to talk about the VA and kind of what our expectations are there? Solomon, do you want to take the first one? Yes. Let me kind of talk on that. So I think the program, the way was kind of initially devised, there was an RFP process, and we were selected, I think a lot of companies applied and they all had to make decisions about what they thought was best for them. But in the end, it was Austin and Quest, we're the only ones really allowed to offer NIPT testing in the state. We thought that, that would be, I think, okay, given that we're taking a lower price and we're expanding the volume and there's some opportunities to cross-sell other products. So we decided to go ahead and participate. Now obviously, it's a lower margin opportunity. It wasn't ideal, but we decided to kind of go ahead with it because we thought it was important to be in California. Now with this recent legal happening where there's an injunction that's been given against the program that prevents them from, kind of, implementing certain aspects of the program. I think it's not clear exactly we're still, kind of, understanding what that means. So that I think one of the likely path is that we kind of go back to the way things were. And that's, I think, frankly, a positive for us. But we're also fine being in the program. So I think we just have to kind of see how things pan out. For us modeling goes, we've obviously been very conservative in our guidance both for the, kind of, rest of the year and as we turn the corner into \u201823, assuming, sort of, the worst-case scenario. So any improvement to that worst-case scenario would be upside."

Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, August 4, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Michael Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter of 2022. On the line, I'm joined by Steve Chapman, our CEO; and Solomon Moshkevich, General Manager of Oncology. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be available at investor.natera.com. Starting on Slide 2. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our operational and financial outlook and projections, our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various current and future products, including product capabilities, expected release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, August 4, 2022. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Thanks, Mike. Let's get into Q2 highlights on Slide 3. As you can see from the press release, we had another strong quarter in Q2. Revenues grew approximately 40% over Q2 of last year. And we reached an incredible new milestone by processing 500,000 tests in a single quarter, growing more than 33% over Q2 of last year. We achieved this growth rate despite the fact that Q2 of last year had a large onetime benefit from a competitor exiting the NIPT business. We saw a strong continued sequential growth from organ health and oncology products, strong ASP gains in Signatera in NIPT, and we further strengthened our NIPT market position. We estimate our Panorama test now commands roughly 50% market share in this expanding market. This business momentum enables us to again raise our 2022 revenue guidance to $805 million to $825 million, an increase of $15 million at the midpoint. Pro forma for last year's onetime QIAGEN revenue of $28.6 million, this new range implies an annual revenue growth of 37%. Mike will cover this in detail later in the call, but our progress so far this year makes us even more confident on our path to cash flow breakeven in mid-2024. As good as the Q2 results were, they were negatively impacted by a timing difference of about $3 million worth of volumes that were accessioned in our lab but not reported out until early July. So we took the expenses on that testing in Q2, but we'll recognize the revenue and margin benefit in Q3. Therefore, we believe the printed results actually understate the momentum we think we are seeing in the business right now, and I think the rest of these highlights show that we are just getting started. We recently announced that we've been selected to participate in UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Laboratory Network after completion of a rigorous application and review process for access, cost, data, quality and service. We were pleased to have the chance to undergo this rigorous review with the largest commercial insurer in the United States. We share UnitedHealthcare's commitment to driving improved patient access, affordability, outcomes and patient experience. Our organ health products were a significant contributor to both volume and revenue growth in the quarter. We were thrilled to see the publication of the Trifecta study in Transplantation, which is a leading journal in the transplant space. We think the Trifecta publication is a significant accomplishment. This is the largest prospective multisite fully biopsy-matched study that has ever been published in the space and highlighted the benefits of testing for both donor-derived cell-free DNA percent and quantity, which we provide with each Prospera result. I'll spend more time on this data in a few moments. In oncology, our progress for Signatera continues to exceed our expectations. We continue to reach a record number of Signatera tests performed in each sequential quarter with our commercial momentum remaining very strong, led by colorectal and IO monitoring indications. In addition, we recently secured Medicare reimbursement for Signatera in muscle invasive bladder cancer. We think the clinical need for Signatera among muscle invasive bladder cancer patients is significant. And the peer-reviewed data we have presented thus far in bladder cancer is compelling. This is now the fourth time we have secured Medicare reimbursement and the first coverage expansion under the foundational LCD for MRD testing in solid tumors published in December of 2021. I think that demonstrates the breadth and depth of our data generation across tumor types and highlights our competitive advantage over others in the liquid biopsy space. We continue the drumbeat of presenting excellent data at ASCO in June with 11 circulating tumor DNA abstracts, including one oral and seven poster presentations. In addition, we plan to publish or submit many significant studies for Signatera in the next few months, including data in colorectal, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, melanoma and bladder cancers. Seven of these studies have more than 500 time points, making them some of the largest circulating tumor DNA studies to date and four are in new tumor types. I think the breadth and quality of the data opens up new indications where we can pursue reimbursement while also burnishing our credibility with community oncologists that treat many different types of cancer. Solomon will go into more detail on all of this later in the call. We were also thrilled to welcome Dr. Minetta Liu to Natera as Chief Medical Officer for Oncology. Dr. Liu previously served as Professor of Oncology and Chair of Research in the Department of Oncology at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Liu brings a wealth of expertise in how practicing oncologists can best apply Signatera and has already proven to be a fantastic addition to our team. Finally, we received another vote of confidence in the business from our Executive Chairman, Matt Rabinowitz, who announced an additional equity investment in Natera. This is on the heels of our lead independent director making an investment in Q1 and top management electing to forgo cash salaries this year in favor of stock compensation. We are all very excited about Natera's future, and I think the Q2 results demonstrate we are on the right track. Okay. Let's get into some of the business trends on the next slide. We processed a record 499,901 units in the quarter, 1/3 more than we processed just in Q2 of last year. As you can see from the volume progression on the chart, it was just recently that we surpassed 1 million tests for a full year in 2020. So to be at the 500,000 test level for a single quarter demonstrates the strong momentum in the business. We overcame our typical seasonality in the women's health business that we have historically seen in the second quarter, which is a function of existing accounts seeing fewer prenatal patients during Q2. In fact, this is only the second time in recent history that we've grown sequentially in Q2 versus Q1. New account starts were very strong, and we see an opportunity to further consolidate market share in women's health. Since the SMART trial was published in the spring, we are finding that data to be a significant competitive advantage in the field. We are off to a very strong start so far in Q3, and I think the raised guidance demonstrates our visibility, solid performance in the second half of this year. On the next slide, you can see the revenue growth was even stronger than the unit growth at 40%. That was driven by another step-up in NIPT ASPs in the quarter and continued strong sequential growth in our clinical ASPs for Signatera. As clinical Signatera volumes grow, the ASP progression is particularly impactful to the overall model. We described last quarter how clinical Signatera ASPs were in the 500s last year and stepped up to roughly $650 in Q1. We are now seeing the Signatera ASPs in the 700s for the first time, and we think there's room for more improvement in the second half of this year. This is being driven primarily by our mix of Medicare-reimbursed tests improving and an increasing fraction of our volume starting to come from the recurrence monitoring indication, which is reimbursed by Medicare at the ADLT rate of $3,900. So again, part of upward re-rating the guidance for the year is not only volumes but also these positive ASP trends. On the next slide is a bit more detail on our selection to UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network effective July 1. We have a long track record of innovation to improve the patient experience and delivering data that shows improved patient outcomes. So we are pleased to partner with United on this effort. United only includes a handful of U.S. labs in this network. And to be selective, labs must undergo a very rigorous, month-long quality audit that includes detailed review of claims, processes and our internal software systems. This change means less administrative costs. And overall, we expect this agreement to be a positive for our women's health products. In women's health, we continue to benefit from further market penetration, driven by ACOG's average risk recommendation in NIPT from August of 2020. We estimate the NIPT market is roughly 50% penetrated. So there's still a large opportunity for growth, enabling us to help more patients and physicians. Our volume has also increased from competitive wins where we continue to differentiate ourselves with unique clinical features and strong data, combined with our focus on user experience. We now estimate we have roughly 50% of the overall NIPT market share. I think we're well positioned to continue to lead going forward given we're still publishing meaningful data and adding clinical features, while many competitors do not appear to be investing in clinical data generation or their NIPT business. One example of our investment in clinical data generation is the publication of landmark SMART study in The Gray Journal, which validated the high clinical utility of 22q testing. The performance of our 22q test in the SMART trial was remarkable and may further differentiate our product going forward. Natera's 22q test is well positioned given the excellent sensitivity, specificity and PPV and because of our ability to assess the smaller 22q deletions that have historically been more difficult to detect and make up roughly 41% of the disease load. Test performance, breadth of disease load coverage and strong clinical data are important for physicians. Based on this quality of the SMART study, we are now even more optimistic that 22q deletion syndrome could be included positively in society guidelines in the near future. As 22q becomes more important as part of the decision of which NIPT laboratory to use, we see the benefit of choosing Natera increasing. Okay. Now in organ health, let's spend a bit more time on the Trifecta study recently published in Transplantation, which is a leading journal in the transplant space. The Trifecta study is the largest prospective multisite study of fully biopsy-matched patients for donor-derived cell-free DNA analysis conducted to date. Using a novel two-threshold algorithm incorporating both donor fraction and estimated amount of donor-derived cell-free DNA when assessing active rejection, the Prospera assay excelled at discriminating between active rejection and nonactive rejection with an AUC of 0.88 versus molecular pathology. We are very proud of these results and the significant body of peer-reviewed evidence that we have generated now in the transplant space. We're continuing to perform very well, seeing record levels of test utilization in kidney, heart and lung donor-derived cell-free DNA testing. Shifting gears now to Renasight, which is our germline test for patients with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease affects roughly 37 million Americans, making it one of the single largest areas of health care today. Genetic testing for renal conditions using a broad test such as Renasight has demonstrated clinical utility. In fact, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that roughly 10% of chronic kidney disease patients have a genetic etiology. Results can inform targeted treatment and therapies, help avoid kidney biopsy, confirm or reclassify a clinical diagnosis, provide risk assessment to relatives, identify candidates for clinical trials and diagnose conditions that could benefit from additional medical referrals. A recent executive statement from the KDIGO guideline group has suggested that nephrologists should think genetic when evaluating chronic kidney disease patients. We completed enrollment in our RenaCARE real-world prospective multisite study in late July. Total enrollment in the study is now -- was more than 1,700 patients across over 30 U.S. sites. To our knowledge, this is the only large-scale prospective multisite study looking at the clinical utility of performing routine genetic testing on chronic kidney disease patients. As a reminder, we started this study several years ago with the most prestigious academic centers in the field and partnered with Dr. Ali Gharavi, who's the Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Columbia University, as a principal investigator. We expect to submit this study for publication in late 2022. And we think it could have the potential to change guidelines around the management of patients with chronic kidney disease. We believe that CKD patients should be able to receive germline testing at the time of diagnosis. Given the number of patients diagnosed and living with CKD, the TAM for this opportunity is similar to that of hereditary cancer testing. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Solomon to cover our recent progress in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. The big news in oncology was MolDx's decision to cover Signatera for muscle invasive bladder cancer under its umbrella LCD, which we announced in July. This is our fourth coverage decision by Medicare for Signatera after early-stage colorectal cancer; then a follow-on extension for Stage IV oligometastatic colorectal cancer; then third, the pan-cancer immunotherapy monitoring; and now, bladder cancer. We expect the coding and pricing will be similar to CRC with coverage effect as of April 19. Based on the communications we've had from MolDx, we believe coverage will include the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings. With about 81,000 newly diagnosed cases per year, bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. generally split into muscle invasive and non-muscle invasive. Signatera's coverage in muscle invasive disease on the right side of the page represents, we believe, about 35,000 new patients per year. With a median age of diagnosis at 73, we expect a heavier Medicare mix in this patient population than we see in CRC. Based on our anticipated testing schedule, which itself is based on current NCCN guidelines for imaging, we believe this implies approximately 400,000 Signatera tests per year at full adoption. As a reminder, to put this in perspective, that is more than 2x the size of the entire breast cancer gene expression testing market, which has been a very important area for diagnostics in the past. But most importantly, this will have a big impact on patients and patient care. To better understand the clinical utility of Signatera in this population, let's take a look at the patient journey. Today, guidelines recommend starting with a TURBT procedure which stands for a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. This allows for pathological staging and assessment of the tumor's invasion into the surrounding muscle tissue. Once it's been diagnosed as muscle invasive, guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to cystectomy. This is where the first clinical conundrum presents itself as guidelines recommend monitoring for neoadjuvant treatment response and switching treatments if a patient fails to respond. However, it's reported that approximately 60% of patients do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a lack of good biomarkers to assess that response. After surgery in the adjuvant setting, up to 2/3 of patients are cured by their surgery alone, while the other approximately 1/3 of patients will go on to experience distant recurrence. Here, the clinical challenge is whether to prescribe adjuvant systemic treatment, either chemotherapy for those patients who did not have neoadjuvant chemo or the new option of prescribing a year of immunotherapy as nivolumab was recently approved for use in patients at high risk of recurrence. Finally, in the surveillance setting, NCCN guidelines already recommend intensive monitoring as the scientific evidence is strong that early asymptomatic detection of recurrence leads to better survival. However, with the current monitoring tools, primarily imaging, it's reported that at least 50% of relapses are still detected too late. Signatera has been validated as a prognostic and predictive biomarker to help inform each of these challenges in conjunction with standard imaging and clinical assessment. There are two major peer-reviewed publications that supported Signatera's clinical validity in these settings. First, the 2019 Christensen paper in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which followed 68 patients with regular testing, 656 time points in total, all the way from diagnosis through neoadjuvant therapy, surgery, then MRD assessment and recurrence monitoring. This study showed that serial Signatera testing could detect relapse with 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity with an average diagnostic lead time of about three months. Second, in the 2021 Powles paper in the journal Nature, we reported that Signatera could identify the 37% of patients who were MRD-positive after surgery and who benefited significantly from immunotherapy, while the other 63% of MIBC patients who are MRD-negative did not see any significant benefit from immunotherapy. Coming from the Phase III randomized IMvigor010 trial, this was the first demonstration that Signatera is predictive as well as prognostic. The strength of that data, together with the breadth of evidence in other cancer types, is what makes oncologists so enthusiastic about incorporating Signatera into their standard of care. We're now shifting our focus to commercialization to get this into the hands of as many bladder cancer patients as possible. We're already in an excellent position to commercialize with our existing infrastructure because Signatera is a pan-cancer platform. We will use the existing sales and marketing team focused on community and academic oncologists, the same user experience and customer support tools that have already been established and just simply continue scaling the existing Signatera lab since it's the same MRD product that we already offer for CRC and IO monitoring. With our strong commercial adoption and with every new covered indication, we create additional operating leverage and drive additional customer loyalty, further extending our first-mover advantage in this exciting field. After the bladder cancer announcement, we have been asked what is next in the clinical road map. We anticipate several important data sets to be published or submitted in the coming months in the areas of colorectal, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, melanoma and more. As Steve mentioned, seven of these papers have more than 500 time points and four of them are in tumor types where Natera has not yet published peer-reviewed data, making them substantial additions to our body of evidence. We expect those papers to publish in the second half of this year or in early 2023. And that will support our goals to expand insurance coverage to more patients. We also continue to grow and execute on our pipeline of prospective clinical trials, which are expected to deliver definitive practice-changing evidence over the coming years. In particular, I want to highlight here our continued momentum in colorectal cancer. Number one, we have submitted the CIRCULATE data from Japan for publication, which now includes 18 months of clinical follow-up versus the 12 months we presented earlier at ASCO GI. We expect that paper to be published soon. Number two, we're pleased to have enrolled the first patient into the new NCI-sponsored CIRCULATE-US trial. We think these two trials are an important part of our strategy to increase utilization and achieve our coverage goals. On the next slide, we're seeing early signs of enthusiasm from private payers. And we're hopeful that the NCCN Guidelines Committee for CRC, which meets in late August, may incorporate tumor-informed MRD into their guidelines. We believe a guidelines update is further supported by the recent data from Australia published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which showed that MRD-guided treatment of stage II colon cancer resulted in the same survival outcomes with approximately 2x less chemotherapy. Now I'd like to hand it over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Great. Thanks, Solomon. The first slide is just the standard financial results for Q2. Steve covered the key trends on volumes and revenues. As Steve mentioned, revenues would have been roughly $3 million higher in the quarter, if not for the timing difference between accessioning in the lab and reporting out the units, which is the event we need to accrue revenue. So that also artificially held down gross margins in the quarter, and I expect Q3 gross margins to be a little higher than usual as a result. Steve touched on the fact that new account starts were really strong in Q2. In women's health, we have a sustained track record of adding 250 to 300 new physician offices ordering per month on a base of approximately 20,000 customer accounts. We saw another quarter of good sequential progress on clinical Signatera ASPs. We've now moved from the ASPs in the 500s last year to roughly $650 in Q1 to now just above an estimated $700 in Q2 for the clinical ASPs. With clinical COGS now in the low 500s, we are still gross margin dilutive. But that progression is absolutely critical, given that the volumes continue to exceed our initial sales targets. We are armed with another coverage decision in our favor, and we are optimistic about starting to get some commercial coverage traction as Solomon described. I think that sets up for more ASP progress on Signatera in the second half of the year. NIPT ASPs were up sequentially again this quarter, and we think there's more room for progress on women's health ASPs in the second half of the year. The balance sheet remains strong. We used substantially less cash in Q2 as compared to Q1 this year. We expect quarterly cash usage to continue to drop meaningfully in the second half as revenues grow and expenses remain stable. In addition to that progression, we estimate that we have about $30 million in receivables on accrued units that we expect to catch up on in the second half of the year. The catch-up is driven by a software update that caused us to hold a portion of our claims this spring and our ramping up of operations that are particular from Medicare reimbursement for Signatera. Spending a bit more time on the cash flow breakeven on the next slide. Last quarter, we went into some detail laying out a longer-range model with our expected progression. I won't repeat all of that here, but the first half of 2022 has reinforced for us that getting to cash flow breakeven is not going to require draconian cuts or fundamental changes to the business model. Today, we've already established ourselves as the market leader in multiple large and growing markets. We've got a significant lead in generating data that we think could take years to close even if we stop clinical trials now. We front-loaded our investment in commercial infrastructure, and we are reaping the benefits as the volumes come in and revenues continue to grow quickly. Because of all that, we can generate significant returns on invested capital by porting these established products onto lower-cost sequencers and scaling our cost-efficient Austin lab. So just that base case drives clear visibility to cash flow breakeven. Based on the results we've seen so far this year, we now think we can get to a cash flow-breakeven quarter by mid-2024. On top of that base case, I think we have a number of potentially meaningful catalysts that we think can be achieved in the near term, as you can see on the right-hand side of the page. We think it's likely one or more of these could be achieved as early as this year. Any one of these catalysts would represent another step function change for the Company, and we've spent a lot of time describing why we are in a great position to achieve each of them. Okay. Good. Let's get to the next slide and the updated guidance for the year. Steve touched on the re-rate of the revenue guidance range for the rest of the year. As you can see on the slide, this new guide represents a major step up from our initial guide in March and reflects the strength we are seeing in both ASPs and volumes across the Company. We are holding cash burn, margins and expenses stable to the prior guide for now, which represents some caution on the working capital elements we described earlier, expected continued scale in the women's health products and a recognition that the Signatera clinical unit economics, while improving, are still in a phase where they are dilutive to gross margins for the time being. Finally, we expect to publish our inaugural ESG report in the near term, including our 2025 sustainability goals, which we are very excited about. So we're very pleased to be able to share these results with you today. And now let me hand the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Congrats on a strong [indiscernible] here. My first question is on reproductive health. Steve, can you talk a little bit about the opportunities for share gain that you alluded to here, particularly given some of the competitors going through internal restructurings? How much of that is playing into your outlook increase? And then as we think about sort of the Roe versus Wade decision, is there a possibility here of microdels getting into guidelines sooner off that? And how should we think about the revenue implications? Is that sort of a '23 situation?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think on the share gains, we think it comes down to a lot of things. I think largely that we generated significantly more clinical data supporting the validation and the performance of Panorama than any other NIPT company. And in addition, there's about nine points of clinical differentiation where we offer things that others simply can't do. So I think it's largely those two things, combined with our focus on user experience that are driving our share gains. Of course, as others pull back their investments both in their commercial infrastructure and also in R&D, I think that does benefit us. But largely, I think we're benefiting from the data and the clinical differentiation. On the 22q side, we've talked a little bit more in this earnings call about the possibility of society guidelines being updated in the near future. There's a very strong clinical utility resulting from doing prenatal testing for the 22q deletion and that's outlined in the SMART study, which was the largest prospective trial that's ever been done in the space that was published in January of this year. So we do think that there's a likelihood, a possibility that society guidelines change in the near future and include 22q as part of routine prenatal screening. And I'd just say that we feel more confident now than we have in the past that those guidelines are going to change.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Delahunt with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Delahunt: Guys, congrats on the strong quarter. You see the ASPs going up. Could you double-click on that and give us a little bit more color on what's going into both NIPT ASPs going up as well as the Signatera getting up into the 700s now?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Good. Yes. Thanks for the question, Dave. Good to talk with you. Yes. I mean, look, no surprise, right? I think on the Signatera ASP, it's largely what we had high hopes and expected for at the beginning of the year, which is our Medicare mix is increasing, the number of chemotypes that are reimbursed are increasing. And we're just getting further into launch. And so you're going to just have more and more patients that are actually falling into these reimbursed categories that could get further into the launch. So it's really a pretty natural organic progression on Signatera as we're very focused on, obviously, because those lines are really ramping. So on the NIPT side, it's -- again, it's pretty predictable. It's -- there's a significant chunk of -- especially state plans that haven't historically priced or covered NIPT. There's been some other barriers to kind of getting reimbursed for those patients and though that's gradually improving, whether it's kind of administrative barriers stopping us from getting the reimbursement for a covered test or just new coverage policies coming online. So those are kind of the main drivers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: What are you expecting in terms of -- for muscle invasive bladder and any contribution to guidance there? And related to that, I think you've seen stronger adoption in [longer] patient population for CRC. And given the older SKU for bladder, is that something that you would anticipate being a rate limiter for adoption?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Solomon, do you want to take that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Happy to. I actually didn't quite hear the very first part of your question, Cathy. Was it -- what we expect for commercial adoption in bladder cancer? I guess we can't hear her anymore. But yes, I'll answer the second part. Certainly, the -- with the median age of diagnosis at 73, we do expect a bigger Medicare mix there, a heavier Medicare mix, which is going to be positive for ASPs. And we don't expect that necessarily to weigh down anything in the adoption curve. The enthusiasm and receptiveness that we've encountered thus far among GU oncologists is quite significant given the unmet needs that they have today in managing our bladder cancer patients.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Let me just add on commercial adoption, I'll say we're already seeing a nice increase in the utilization in muscle invasive bladder post some of these publications coming out. And post the coverage decision, there's been, I think, a lot of positive buzz. So I think we're feeling good about it. I think when you look at the overall TAM, it's about maybe 1/3 of -- maybe between 1/3 and 1/2 of what we had announced previously for colorectal, so that's potentially a good benchmark. But the other thing that I think is really unique here is that there's very limited data, I think, from competitors in this sector in muscle invasive bladder. And I think that's an opportunity for us to really kind of, on the long term, have a very significant outsized share of this particular segment of the market, which, I think -- which is a great benefit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Max Masucci with Cowen.\nMax Masucci: Just the first one, if you look at Slide 20 in the deck, it highlights the mid-2024 target for quarterly cash flow breakeven. In the prior Q1 slide deck, it suggested that $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion revenue run rate and 55% gross margins would get you there to breakeven. So if we just look at that mid-2024 target on Slide 20, it seems to imply that $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in revenues could be a reasonable target for 2024. Just looking at consensus, it's just north of $1.2 billion. So it's more of a broad question of just about how we should think about that, bridging those two numbers and the confidence that we can have in our modeling for the growth segments?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. Good to chat with you. So yes, so look, all that stuff is roughly right. I think the distinction is that what we're calling for us in getting to a quarter where we're kind of crossing over that cash flow breakeven threshold as distinct from like a full year revenue number. So there's just a little bit of nuance there. And that's a question we often get is just kind of which quarter does that -- roughly what the timing is. I do think that our -- with our confidence on getting to that level has increased as the year has gone on because of all the commentary we provided in the prepared remarks. It's the headlines of continued commercial traction, the continued progress across all points of the business gives us more comfort to give -- provide a little bit more precision around a quarter. I don't think that necessarily implies that there seems to be a disconnect in terms of the numbers that were put out previously versus the model. I think it's just a distinction of like getting to a specific quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: So first one is really around NCCN. Can you just provide any updates there in terms of Signatera? And any studies or things that you have submitted or anything that you expect here in the second half?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I'll take that. And Solomon, maybe you may want to add something additional. So I think we're feeling positive. Although we don't control the guidelines, I still think that there's some good discussion happening with KOLs that we're feeling positive about, both from the data that we've generated and also from the data from the DYNAMIC trial that was presented previously. So I think that there is a good opportunity for guidelines to potentially change in the summer or later in the year, like the December time frame. The biggest contribution that we'll be making to that will be the publication of the CIRCULATE-Japan study. And that paper is now in submission as we said it would be. And there is a possibility it could be published sometime this summer or in the early fall. And one of the key updates is that the follow-up for that study has now been extended to 18 months. And I think that just makes the paper even stronger than it was before and I think well positions that to really drive guidelines if they haven't changed this summer based on the existing data. Solomon, feel free to add to that if you'd like.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. I'll just add two things. First, we do not think that publication of the GALAXY data in August is gating for a change in the guidelines, though we've done everything we can to accelerate that. And again, the reason we don't think it's gating is just because there has been so much other data now published and presented in the field that has really impacted how leading GI oncologists think about utility here. And as Steve mentioned, the DYNAMIC trial from Australia was a welcome addition to the overall body of evidence supporting ctDNA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julia Qin with JPMorgan.\nJulia Qin: Can you hear me now?\nSteve Chapman: Yes.\nJulia Qin: All right. Could you give us an update on the current mix between first-year patients and recurring patients? And in light of the expanded coverage, what kind of ASP trajectory are you expecting for Signatera over the next few years?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Let me comment on the first one. And then maybe, Mike, you can talk about the ASP trajectory. So long term, when you look at the number of patients that are living with cancer versus the number of patients that are diagnosed every year, obviously, there's way more patients that are living with cancer. And so over the long term, we think that there's going to be a very significant shift to the recurrence monitoring indication. What we're seeing now though is just the demand and the uptake for the test is still high that we're seeing like a very large number of new patients coming in, and these are patients that are using the test for the first time. And as we -- our commercial and clinical team meet with more doctors, there's a lot of these patients coming in for the first time at their first time point. Now we are seeing, over time, over the past two years, a shift in the volume towards the recurrence monitoring and longitudinal tracking segment, which is what one would expect. But obviously, it's not going to fit with this sort of population dynamic just because we do have this significant number of new patients coming in. Mike, do you want to comment further on the ASP?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. I mean I think those drivers actually influence ASP quite a lot. I think in summary, we think that the current ASP is quite immature for Signatera, and it's really a function of volumes expanding in these reimbursed populations, having more of these populations covered by Medicare, where we feel like we can really make a huge difference to the care in these patients. The clinical utility that we've demonstrated, I think, in some of the data that we published, particularly the prospective data in colorectal cancer, we think is really compelling. And obviously, that would then direct guidelines, which, of course, guidelines would then drive a broader commercial coverage. All those things are areas that we expect to have happen over the next few years in Signatera, which would drive ASPs significantly higher and make this business something that works for everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with BTIG.\nVidyun Bais: This is Vivian on for Mark. So could you share with us at a high level what some of the key milestones or catalysts will be for your early detection program? Could you also share any learnings you may have gleaned from potential discussions with the FDA as it relates to clinical trial development or size of patient enrollment?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks for the question. So as we said before, on early cancer detection, which is a priority for us, what we're doing is we're leveraging the data that we have on early-stage tumor exomes, and we've used that to generate a proprietary targeted panel of DNA mutations. We're combining that with methylation signatures, both available from public databases but also that we've developed ourselves and that we've licensed from our partnership with Aarhus University. So we're taking the DNA combined with methylation and we plan to run that and generate some data looking at the performance of the test. The initial performance looks good, and that's prompted us, obviously, to continue with the work. But we plan on having a kind of more significant readout, I would say, later in '22 at some point in kind of the first half of '23 roughly. The biggest milestones in front of us are getting feedback from the FDA. In fact, we've already done our pre-submission to discuss the clinical trial that we are participating in. And we're looking forward to that meeting, which will be coming up in the next couple of months. And then post that, we'll be understanding their feedback, adapting our trial strategy if need be and then generating more significant proof-of-concept data, as I mentioned in the next kind of year or so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum.\nConnor Stevenson: This is Connor on for Alex. I guess, first, I was hoping on some color around the competitive environment in MRD test. As I'm sure you all know, Guardant Health got their test covered. But I mean, do you expect some of these tests to be solely used for adjuvant decision-making and others used for recurrence monitoring? Just some thoughts there would be helpful.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks. So from a competitor standpoint, I think we think that we're doing exceptionally well. I think in physicians' minds, we're seeing that the tumor-informed approach is the winner. We think we have the vast majority of the market share at this point, and we're in a very good position. Most of that is driven by the breadth and depth and quality of our peer-reviewed data. We think physicians will want to use the same test for the MRD time point and adjuvant decision-making as they will for recurrence monitoring. And when you look at our local coverage decision from Medicare based on the data that we've generated and the peer-reviewed evidence that we've had, we've received coverage for both the MRD time point adjuvant decision-making in addition to longitudinal monitoring or recurrence monitoring. And we think that that's really important long term. Similar, when you look at muscle invasive bladder, we've now received coverage for neoadjuvant for MRD adjuvant and for longitudinal recurrence monitoring. Again, I think just showing that we have super high-quality data and the breadth of our data is outside of just one narrow indication.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mason Carrico with Stephens.\nMason Carrico: Sorry about that. Maybe to hit on Prospera kidney for a minute. Could you update us on penetration in the kidney centers? How many centers are you receiving orders from? And then thinking about the components of growth there, how much is coming from untouched greenfield opportunity? And are you guys taking share there as well?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think from a volume standpoint and a growth standpoint, we're doing well. We're seeing volume increasing. We're hitting record numbers every quarter. Physicians are giving very positive feedback post the publication of the Trifecta study, which was the largest multisite prospective fully biopsy-matched study that's ever been performed. We've continued to get excellent feedback. So we think we're in a good position. We're working with the vast -- well, I'd say, with the majority of transplant centers at this point. I think previously, we've said roughly in the range of 50% or something in that range but that continues to increase. From a penetration standpoint, we think the overall market is probably about 10% penetrated, and that means the vast majority of patients today still aren't being monitored with donor-derived cell-free DNA. And we think that's where the biggest opportunity lies. Now there are some centers that haven't yet adopted donor-derived cell-free DNA. There are some centers that are using it in a selective way. But as things -- more data is generated and as physicians start to use donor-derived testing more frequently in their practice, obviously, there's a large opportunity to help patients.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This is our fourth coverage decision by Medicare for Signatera after early-stage colorectal cancer; then a follow-on extension for Stage IV oligometastatic colorectal cancer; then third, the pan-cancer immunotherapy monitoring; and now, bladder cancer. We expect the coding and pricing will be similar to CRC with coverage effect as of April 19. Based on the communications we've had from MolDx, we believe coverage will include the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings. With about 81,000 newly diagnosed cases per year, bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. generally split into muscle invasive and non-muscle invasive. Signatera's coverage in muscle invasive disease on the right side of the page represents, we believe, about 35,000 new patients per year. With a median age of diagnosis at 73, we expect a heavier Medicare mix in this patient population than we see in CRC. Based on our anticipated testing schedule, which itself is based on current NCCN guidelines for imaging, we believe this implies approximately 400,000 Signatera tests per year at full adoption. As a reminder, to put this in perspective, that is more than 2x the size of the entire breast cancer gene expression testing market, which has been a very important area for diagnostics in the past. But most importantly, this will have a big impact on patients and patient care. To better understand the clinical utility of Signatera in this population, let's take a look at the patient journey.

We anticipate several important data sets to be published or submitted in the coming months in the areas of colorectal, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, melanoma and more. As Steve mentioned, seven of these papers have more than 500 time points and four of them are in tumor types where Natera has not yet published peer-reviewed data, making them substantial additions to our body of evidence. We expect those papers to publish in the second half of this year or in early 2023. And that will support our goals to expand insurance coverage to more patients. We also continue to grow and execute on our pipeline of prospective clinical trials, which are expected to deliver definitive practice-changing evidence over the coming years. In particular, I want to highlight here our continued momentum in colorectal cancer. Number one, we have submitted the CIRCULATE data from Japan for publication, which now includes 18 months of clinical follow-up versus the 12 months we presented earlier at ASCO GI. We expect that paper to be published soon. Number two, we're pleased to have enrolled the first patient into the new NCI-sponsored CIRCULATE-US trial. We think these two trials are an important part of our strategy to increase utilization and achieve our coverage goals. On the next slide, we're seeing early signs of enthusiasm from private payers. And we're hopeful that the NCCN Guidelines Committee for CRC, which meets in late August, may incorporate tumor-informed MRD into their guidelines. We believe a guidelines update is further supported by the recent data from Australia published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which showed that MRD-guided treatment of stage II colon cancer resulted in the same survival outcomes with approximately 2x less chemotherapy. Now I'd like to hand it over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Sure. Happy to. I actually didn't quite hear the very first part of your question, Cathy. Was it -- what we expect for commercial adoption in bladder cancer? I guess we can't hear her anymore. But yes, I'll answer the second part. Certainly, the -- with the median age of diagnosis at 73, we do expect a bigger Medicare mix there, a heavier Medicare mix, which is going to be positive for ASPs. And we don't expect that necessarily to weigh down anything in the adoption curve. The enthusiasm and receptiveness that we've encountered thus far among GU oncologists is quite significant given the unmet needs that they have today in managing our bladder cancer patients. Yes. I'll just add two things. First, we do not think that publication of the GALAXY data in August is gating for a change in the guidelines, though we've done everything we can to accelerate that. And again, the reason we don't think it's gating is just because there has been so much other data now published and presented in the field that has really impacted how leading GI oncologists think about utility here. And as Steve mentioned, the DYNAMIC trial from Australia was a welcome addition to the overall body of evidence supporting ctDNA."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Let's get into Q2 highlights on Slide 3. As you can see from the press release, we had another strong quarter in Q2. Revenues grew approximately 40% over Q2 of last year. And we reached an incredible new milestone by processing 500,000 tests in a single quarter, growing more than 33% over Q2 of last year. We achieved this growth rate despite the fact that Q2 of last year had a large onetime benefit from a competitor exiting the NIPT business. We saw a strong continued sequential growth from organ health and oncology products, strong ASP gains in Signatera in NIPT, and we further strengthened our NIPT market position. We estimate our Panorama test now commands roughly 50% market share in this expanding market. This business momentum enables us to again raise our 2022 revenue guidance to $805 million to $825 million, an increase of $15 million at the midpoint. Pro forma for last year's onetime QIAGEN revenue of $28.6 million, this new range implies an annual revenue growth of 37%. Mike will cover this in detail later in the call, but our progress so far this year makes us even more confident on our path to cash flow breakeven in mid-2024. As good as the Q2 results were, they were negatively impacted by a timing difference of about $3 million worth of volumes that were accessioned in our lab but not reported out until early July. So we took the expenses on that testing in Q2, but we'll recognize the revenue and margin benefit in Q3. Therefore, we believe the printed results actually understate the momentum we think we are seeing in the business right now, and I think the rest of these highlights show that we are just getting started. We recently announced that we've been selected to participate in UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Laboratory Network after completion of a rigorous application and review process for access, cost, data, quality and service. We were pleased to have the chance to undergo this rigorous review with the largest commercial insurer in the United States. We share UnitedHealthcare's commitment to driving improved patient access, affordability, outcomes and patient experience. Our organ health products were a significant contributor to both volume and revenue growth in the quarter. We were thrilled to see the publication of the Trifecta study in Transplantation, which is a leading journal in the transplant space. We think the Trifecta publication is a significant accomplishment. This is the largest prospective multisite fully biopsy-matched study that has ever been published in the space and highlighted the benefits of testing for both donor-derived cell-free DNA percent and quantity, which we provide with each Prospera result. I'll spend more time on this data in a few moments. In oncology, our progress for Signatera continues to exceed our expectations. We continue to reach a record number of Signatera tests performed in each sequential quarter with our commercial momentum remaining very strong, led by colorectal and IO monitoring indications. In addition, we recently secured Medicare reimbursement for Signatera in muscle invasive bladder cancer. We think the clinical need for Signatera among muscle invasive bladder cancer patients is significant. And the peer-reviewed data we have presented thus far in bladder cancer is compelling. This is now the fourth time we have secured Medicare reimbursement and the first coverage expansion under the foundational LCD for MRD testing in solid tumors published in December of 2021. I think that demonstrates the breadth and depth of our data generation across tumor types and highlights our competitive advantage over others in the liquid biopsy space. We continue the drumbeat of presenting excellent data at ASCO in June with 11 circulating tumor DNA abstracts, including one oral and seven poster presentations. In addition, we plan to publish or submit many significant studies for Signatera in the next few months, including data in colorectal, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, melanoma and bladder cancers. Seven of these studies have more than 500 time points, making them some of the largest circulating tumor DNA studies to date and four are in new tumor types. I think the breadth and quality of the data opens up new indications where we can pursue reimbursement while also burnishing our credibility with community oncologists that treat many different types of cancer. Solomon will go into more detail on all of this later in the call. We were also thrilled to welcome Dr. Minetta Liu to Natera as Chief Medical Officer for Oncology. Dr. Liu previously served as Professor of Oncology and Chair of Research in the Department of Oncology at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Liu brings a wealth of expertise in how practicing oncologists can best apply Signatera and has already proven to be a fantastic addition to our team. Finally, we received another vote of confidence in the business from our Executive Chairman, Matt Rabinowitz, who announced an additional equity investment in Natera. This is on the heels of our lead independent director making an investment in Q1 and top management electing to forgo cash salaries this year in favor of stock compensation. We are all very excited about Natera's future, and I think the Q2 results demonstrate we are on the right track. Okay. Let's get into some of the business trends on the next slide. We processed a record 499,901 units in the quarter, 1/3 more than we processed just in Q2 of last year. As you can see from the volume progression on the chart, it was just recently that we surpassed 1 million tests for a full year in 2020. So to be at the 500,000 test level for a single quarter demonstrates the strong momentum in the business. We overcame our typical seasonality in the women's health business that we have historically seen in the second quarter, which is a function of existing accounts seeing fewer prenatal patients during Q2. In fact, this is only the second time in recent history that we've grown sequentially in Q2 versus Q1. New account starts were very strong, and we see an opportunity to further consolidate market share in women's health. Since the SMART trial was published in the spring, we are finding that data to be a significant competitive advantage in the field. We are off to a very strong start so far in Q3, and I think the raised guidance demonstrates our visibility, solid performance in the second half of this year. On the next slide, you can see the revenue growth was even stronger than the unit growth at 40%. That was driven by another step-up in NIPT ASPs in the quarter and continued strong sequential growth in our clinical ASPs for Signatera. As clinical Signatera volumes grow, the ASP progression is particularly impactful to the overall model. We described last quarter how clinical Signatera ASPs were in the 500s last year and stepped up to roughly $650 in Q1. We are now seeing the Signatera ASPs in the 700s for the first time, and we think there's room for more improvement in the second half of this year. This is being driven primarily by our mix of Medicare-reimbursed tests improving and an increasing fraction of our volume starting to come from the recurrence monitoring indication, which is reimbursed by Medicare at the ADLT rate of $3,900. So again, part of upward re-rating the guidance for the year is not only volumes but also these positive ASP trends. On the next slide is a bit more detail on our selection to UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network effective July 1. We have a long track record of innovation to improve the patient experience and delivering data that shows improved patient outcomes. So we are pleased to partner with United on this effort. United only includes a handful of U.S. labs in this network. And to be selective, labs must undergo a very rigorous, month-long quality audit that includes detailed review of claims, processes and our internal software systems. This change means less administrative costs. And overall, we expect this agreement to be a positive for our women's health products. In women's health, we continue to benefit from further market penetration, driven by ACOG's average risk recommendation in NIPT from August of 2020. We estimate the NIPT market is roughly 50% penetrated. So there's still a large opportunity for growth, enabling us to help more patients and physicians. Our volume has also increased from competitive wins where we continue to differentiate ourselves with unique clinical features and strong data, combined with our focus on user experience. We now estimate we have roughly 50% of the overall NIPT market share. I think we're well positioned to continue to lead going forward given we're still publishing meaningful data and adding clinical features, while many competitors do not appear to be investing in clinical data generation or their NIPT business. One example of our investment in clinical data generation is the publication of landmark SMART study in The Gray Journal, which validated the high clinical utility of 22q testing. The performance of our 22q test in the SMART trial was remarkable and may further differentiate our product going forward. Natera's 22q test is well positioned given the excellent sensitivity, specificity and PPV and because of our ability to assess the smaller 22q deletions that have historically been more difficult to detect and make up roughly 41% of the disease load. Test performance, breadth of disease load coverage and strong clinical data are important for physicians. Based on this quality of the SMART study, we are now even more optimistic that 22q deletion syndrome could be included positively in society guidelines in the near future. As 22q becomes more important as part of the decision of which NIPT laboratory to use, we see the benefit of choosing Natera increasing. Okay. Now in organ health, let's spend a bit more time on the Trifecta study recently published in Transplantation, which is a leading journal in the transplant space. The Trifecta study is the largest prospective multisite study of fully biopsy-matched patients for donor-derived cell-free DNA analysis conducted to date. Using a novel two-threshold algorithm incorporating both donor fraction and estimated amount of donor-derived cell-free DNA when assessing active rejection, the Prospera assay excelled at discriminating between active rejection and nonactive rejection with an AUC of 0.88 versus molecular pathology. We are very proud of these results and the significant body of peer-reviewed evidence that we have generated now in the transplant space. We're continuing to perform very well, seeing record levels of test utilization in kidney, heart and lung donor-derived cell-free DNA testing. Shifting gears now to Renasight, which is our germline test for patients with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease affects roughly 37 million Americans, making it one of the single largest areas of health care today. Genetic testing for renal conditions using a broad test such as Renasight has demonstrated clinical utility. In fact, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that roughly 10% of chronic kidney disease patients have a genetic etiology. Results can inform targeted treatment and therapies, help avoid kidney biopsy, confirm or reclassify a clinical diagnosis, provide risk assessment to relatives, identify candidates for clinical trials and diagnose conditions that could benefit from additional medical referrals. A recent executive statement from the KDIGO guideline group has suggested that nephrologists should think genetic when evaluating chronic kidney disease patients. We completed enrollment in our RenaCARE real-world prospective multisite study in late July. Total enrollment in the study is now -- was more than 1,700 patients across over 30 U.S. sites. To our knowledge, this is the only large-scale prospective multisite study looking at the clinical utility of performing routine genetic testing on chronic kidney disease patients. As a reminder, we started this study several years ago with the most prestigious academic centers in the field and partnered with Dr. Ali Gharavi, who's the Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Columbia University, as a principal investigator. We expect to submit this study for publication in late 2022. And we think it could have the potential to change guidelines around the management of patients with chronic kidney disease. We believe that CKD patients should be able to receive germline testing at the time of diagnosis. Given the number of patients diagnosed and living with CKD, the TAM for this opportunity is similar to that of hereditary cancer testing. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Solomon to cover our recent progress in oncology. Solomon? Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think on the share gains, we think it comes down to a lot of things. I think largely that we generated significantly more clinical data supporting the validation and the performance of Panorama than any other NIPT company. And in addition, there's about nine points of clinical differentiation where we offer things that others simply can't do. So I think it's largely those two things, combined with our focus on user experience that are driving our share gains. Of course, as others pull back their investments both in their commercial infrastructure and also in R&D, I think that does benefit us. But largely, I think we're benefiting from the data and the clinical differentiation. On the 22q side, we've talked a little bit more in this earnings call about the possibility of society guidelines being updated in the near future. There's a very strong clinical utility resulting from doing prenatal testing for the 22q deletion and that's outlined in the SMART study, which was the largest prospective trial that's ever been done in the space that was published in January of this year. So we do think that there's a likelihood, a possibility that society guidelines change in the near future and include 22q as part of routine prenatal screening. And I'd just say that we feel more confident now than we have in the past that those guidelines are going to change. Yes, Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. Solomon, do you want to take that? Yes. Let me just add on commercial adoption, I'll say we're already seeing a nice increase in the utilization in muscle invasive bladder post some of these publications coming out. And post the coverage decision, there's been, I think, a lot of positive buzz. So I think we're feeling good about it. I think when you look at the overall TAM, it's about maybe 1/3 of -- maybe between 1/3 and 1/2 of what we had announced previously for colorectal, so that's potentially a good benchmark. But the other thing that I think is really unique here is that there's very limited data, I think, from competitors in this sector in muscle invasive bladder. And I think that's an opportunity for us to really kind of, on the long term, have a very significant outsized share of this particular segment of the market, which, I think -- which is a great benefit. Yes, I'll take that. And Solomon, maybe you may want to add something additional. So I think we're feeling positive. Although we don't control the guidelines, I still think that there's some good discussion happening with KOLs that we're feeling positive about, both from the data that we've generated and also from the data from the DYNAMIC trial that was presented previously. So I think that there is a good opportunity for guidelines to potentially change in the summer or later in the year, like the December time frame. The biggest contribution that we'll be making to that will be the publication of the CIRCULATE-Japan study. And that paper is now in submission as we said it would be. And there is a possibility it could be published sometime this summer or in the early fall. And one of the key updates is that the follow-up for that study has now been extended to 18 months. And I think that just makes the paper even stronger than it was before and I think well positions that to really drive guidelines if they haven't changed this summer based on the existing data. Solomon, feel free to add to that if you'd like. Yes. Yes. Let me comment on the first one. And then maybe, Mike, you can talk about the ASP trajectory. So long term, when you look at the number of patients that are living with cancer versus the number of patients that are diagnosed every year, obviously, there's way more patients that are living with cancer. And so over the long term, we think that there's going to be a very significant shift to the recurrence monitoring indication. What we're seeing now though is just the demand and the uptake for the test is still high that we're seeing like a very large number of new patients coming in, and these are patients that are using the test for the first time. And as we -- our commercial and clinical team meet with more doctors, there's a lot of these patients coming in for the first time at their first time point. Now we are seeing, over time, over the past two years, a shift in the volume towards the recurrence monitoring and longitudinal tracking segment, which is what one would expect. But obviously, it's not going to fit with this sort of population dynamic just because we do have this significant number of new patients coming in. Mike, do you want to comment further on the ASP? Yes. Thanks for the question. So as we said before, on early cancer detection, which is a priority for us, what we're doing is we're leveraging the data that we have on early-stage tumor exomes, and we've used that to generate a proprietary targeted panel of DNA mutations. We're combining that with methylation signatures, both available from public databases but also that we've developed ourselves and that we've licensed from our partnership with Aarhus University. So we're taking the DNA combined with methylation and we plan to run that and generate some data looking at the performance of the test. The initial performance looks good, and that's prompted us, obviously, to continue with the work. But we plan on having a kind of more significant readout, I would say, later in '22 at some point in kind of the first half of '23 roughly. The biggest milestones in front of us are getting feedback from the FDA. In fact, we've already done our pre-submission to discuss the clinical trial that we are participating in. And we're looking forward to that meeting, which will be coming up in the next couple of months. And then post that, we'll be understanding their feedback, adapting our trial strategy if need be and then generating more significant proof-of-concept data, as I mentioned in the next kind of year or so. Yes. Thanks. So from a competitor standpoint, I think we think that we're doing exceptionally well. I think in physicians' minds, we're seeing that the tumor-informed approach is the winner. We think we have the vast majority of the market share at this point, and we're in a very good position. Most of that is driven by the breadth and depth and quality of our peer-reviewed data. We think physicians will want to use the same test for the MRD time point and adjuvant decision-making as they will for recurrence monitoring. And when you look at our local coverage decision from Medicare based on the data that we've generated and the peer-reviewed evidence that we've had, we've received coverage for both the MRD time point adjuvant decision-making in addition to longitudinal monitoring or recurrence monitoring. And we think that that's really important long term. Similar, when you look at muscle invasive bladder, we've now received coverage for neoadjuvant for MRD adjuvant and for longitudinal recurrence monitoring. Again, I think just showing that we have super high-quality data and the breadth of our data is outside of just one narrow indication. Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think from a volume standpoint and a growth standpoint, we're doing well. We're seeing volume increasing. We're hitting record numbers every quarter. Physicians are giving very positive feedback post the publication of the Trifecta study, which was the largest multisite prospective fully biopsy-matched study that's ever been performed. We've continued to get excellent feedback. So we think we're in a good position. We're working with the vast -- well, I'd say, with the majority of transplant centers at this point. I think previously, we've said roughly in the range of 50% or something in that range but that continues to increase. From a penetration standpoint, we think the overall market is probably about 10% penetrated, and that means the vast majority of patients today still aren't being monitored with donor-derived cell-free DNA. And we think that's where the biggest opportunity lies. Now there are some centers that haven't yet adopted donor-derived cell-free DNA. There are some centers that are using it in a selective way. But as things -- more data is generated and as physicians start to use donor-derived testing more frequently in their practice, obviously, there's a large opportunity to help patients."

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. Let us get into the highlights on slide three. As you can all see from the press release, we had another stellar growth quarter in Q1. Total revenue came in at $194 million, driven by strong volume and ASPs. Year-on-year product revenues increased by roughly 58% and 14% sequentially from Q4. Pro forma for the one-time $28 million Qiagen benefit in Q1 of last year, total revenues were also up 57%. Test process grew north of 40% year-on-year and more than 10% sequentially versus Q4 of last year. Keep in mind, this should be tough comparisons. 2021 was a breakout year for Natera and yet the business continues to accelerate. We will get into the drivers shortly, but we are seeing excellent growth across the business, especially in oncology with our Signatera clinical volumes. Given the traction, we are seeing in late Q1 and so far in Q2, we are able to raise our revenue guidance for the year. We started the year at $770 million to $790 million, and we are now forecasting total revenue of $790 million $810 million for the year. We are rapidly getting operating leverage on the investments we have been making in R&D and commercial channels, which has given us more clarity on when we can get to cash flow breakeven. Mike will spend more time on this later in the call. As a reflection of our confidence in the company and the substantial upside value creation we have achieved -- we believe is achievable, the Board, executive leadership and I opted to take our compensation in stock for the balance of the year. Our lead independent director also bought 5 million in shares on the open market. On the heels of a strong 2021, our first quarter results show we are firing on all cylinders and our increased guidance shows we are confident in our ability to maintain the momentum. Turning to a few notable highlights from the quarter, we have had a slew of exciting milestones in our transplant business, which has seen record volume levels on the back of 10 peer-reviewed papers published in the past roughly six months. We have recently announced the publication of VALID study a prospective clinical validation of Prospera1, we announced a 1,000 patient real-world study with Renasight and we announced a multi-site clinical validation of Prospera Heart was published in the Journal of Heart and Lung transplantation, a leading Journal in this space. A few weeks ago, we were also very pleased to announce that Dr. Sangeeta Bhorade joined us as Vice President of Organ Health Medical Affairs. Dr. Bhorade is a leading academic physician in the lung transplant space having founded the Lung Transplant Program at the University of Chicago and separately at Northwestern. Dr. Bhorade joined Natera is the latest addition among other recent notable medical leadership hires including Dr. Michael Olymbios, Medical Director of Heart Transplantation and Dr. David Ross, Medical Director of Lung Transplantation. Dr. Olymbios was previously a member of the Heart Transplant program at Cedars Sinai and the author of many peer-reviewed publications in heart transplant. Dr. David Ross is an academic transplant pulmonologist credited with starting one of the first lung transplant programs at Cedars Sinai in 1989 and has served as the Medical Director of the Lung Transplant Program and Professor of Medicine at UCLA. We also continue to make excellent progress in oncology. We were very pleased to see an update in the landmark circulate data in an oral presentation at the Society of Surgical Oncology 2022. The key update there was Signatera is now showing a 75% detection of recurrence in Stage II and III patients with a single time point MRD blood draw at four weeks post-surgery versus the previous analysis from ASCO GI in January, which showed a single time point detection of 68%. Also, the circulate papers now in submission to a top tier medical journal, which is incredibly exciting. As we have said before, getting the paper published was a key step on the path to NCCN guidelines. So I am really proud of our collaborators and the Natera team for moving so quickly to get the paper submitted. In addition, we have had some good breast cancer data presented recently at AACR further validating Signatera performance in triple-negative in HR-positive diseases in collaboration with Genentech in their I-SPY 2 consortium. And we also have an exciting lineup coming to ASCO this year. On the Signatera reimbursement front, we completed the first pricing measurement period for our ADLT rates since the price was initially established at $3500 last year. As of April 1, 2022, the ADLT rate for Signatera has now been revised upward to $3,920. Obviously, that gives an immediate boost to Medicare reimburse volumes, but I think it also strengthens our position with commercial payers over time. Moving to slide four, let us get into some of the trends. The next slide is a longer run view of our quarterly volume progression. I think this view gives helpful context to the rapid progress we have made. For example, you can see the volumes are more than twice of what they were as recently as Q1 of 2020. Of course, a big reason why we have been outperforming is the product launches in oncology and Organ Health are progressing well above our expectations. For Signatera, we have seen tremendous growth, particularly in the clinical volumes. We have gotten a significant boost from the ASCO GI circulate presentation colorectal cancer and we are still seeing significant organic uptake across a broad range of cancer types of work -- as word of mouth spreads. Clinical ASPs are also ahead of plan. We had a hypothesis that our Medicare mix might increase as we got further into our launch and received more community-based units. That appears to be happening. We are rapidly getting scale on the investment that we made in our oncology commercial channel and Mike will spend more time on this later in the call. We had a great quarter for the Organ Health products as well, particularly in kidney transplants and we are just starting to see the benefit from our efforts in the other organ types as well. That strength is continued and we are currently seeing record Prospera volume levels over the past several weeks. These results clearly demonstrate that we are on track and more broadly, I think the concept of cell-free DNA is a tool for monitoring graft health is taking hold. On the next slide, you can see the revenue trajectory has outpaced the volume trends, as we benefited from positive overall ASP trends over the past few years. The left hand side of the slide shows the year-on-year revenue growth we have seen in Q1 versus prior years and clearly Q1 of 2022 was very strong. The right-hand side puts into perspective the revenue trajectory of the business has been on just the last four quarters. As these new products are starting to ramp, we are very encouraged to see that we are quickly getting leverage on the channels we have built in transplant and oncology and Mike will talk more about that later in the call. Okay, let me cover a few slides on our recent progress in Organ Health. We are now seeing the fruits of our labor with data generation in Organ Health having published 10 peer-reviewed papers in roughly the past six months. On the next slide, our DEDUCE study in heart transplant was published in the Journal of Heart and Lung transplantation, a premier high impact journal in this space. This multi-site clinical validation study Prospera Heart demonstrated the test ability to identify acute rejection in heart transplant patients with an AUC of 0.87 in the perspectives arm of the study, which included more than 700 samples. We are continuing to build robust medical evidence with our ongoing NIH-supported DTR study and the Natera-sponsored DETECT randomized controlled trial. I want to spend a bit more time on Renasight, which is a test we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on in the past. Renasight is a hereditary gene panel that addresses the large market opportunity in chronic kidney disease. There are approximately 37 million patients in the United States living with chronic kidney disease and about 750,000 patients are newly diagnosed per year. In 2019, a large scale validation study of multi-gene testing was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and showed that about 10% of chronic kidney disease patients have a genetic etiology and of those 89% would have had a change in clinical care as a result of their genetic test. This is exceptionally high clinical utility, a very large area of health care. To-date testing has been mostly offered on a limited basis with an academic centers. We introduced Renasight to the nephrology and transplant community, because we thought we could make a big impact on patient care by making genetic testing accessible at scale. Our first study for Renasight was published in the American Journal of Nephrology analyzing the commercial experience of the first 1000 tests with positive findings found at 21% of patients tested. We also had previously invested into a large scale definitive multi-site prospective trial called RenaCARE and are excited to say that we are almost finished with enrollment. RenaCARE will access the clinical utility of Renasight and we actually expect to submit the results of the study for publication in late 2022. I want to make one other comment about our financials before I turn the call over. The RenaCARE study is a good example of a larger trend in our overall business where in many cases we pre-invested into a big future opportunity. While this impacts our near-term operating expenses, many of these are one-time expenses, like RenaCARE where the trial cost goes away once the study is over, but the longer term upside opportunity remains. Another example of this is the randomized controlled trials we are doing in heart and lung transplants. Once those are done, you don\u2019t have to do them again or similarly we have invested in a very talented nationwide oncology sales force, despite they being very underpenetrated in their geographies. This creates leverage because now, operating expenses can stay relatively stable as volumes grow and we can charter path to cash flow breakeven. Mike will give more details on this in his section later in the call. With that, let me now hand the call over to Solomon to provide an update on oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. We have made significant commercial progress so far this year in oncology, as more physicians adopt Signatera and as each physician gains experience and then starts to apply the test across more and more of their patients. We have laid the groundwork over the past five years to be in a position that we are in now, where we are also presenting high-quality clinical data at nearly every major Academic Oncology Conference on the calendar and expecting to publish over 20 peer-reviewed publications this year. One case in point is the CIRCULATE-Japan trial that Steve mentioned earlier. The latest presentation at the SSO conference this year updated the analysis to show recurrence detection in stage II and III CRC at a single time at four weeks post-op of 75%, compared to the 68% that was presented earlier in January. This was in addition to the groundbreaking predictive data, where MRD positive patients clearly benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, while MRD negative patients saw no significant benefit. Getting this data submitted for publication is an important milestone, because we think it\u2019s a publication will improve the odds of NCCN guideline inclusion, which in turn could drive another inflection point in test adoption and coverage. We were also pleased to announce the launch of the prospective randomized circulate U.S. trial, which is now open for enrollment across the country. If successful, study will add further evidence on top of the Japanese trial to definitively prove that Stage III CRC patients who test Signatera negative will not benefit from additional treatment. In Q1, we also announced a key milestone in our bespoke CRC registry trial, which now has more than 1,000 patients enrolled at over 100 sites. The pace of enrollment in this study has been strong, which reflects the excitement in the field from both physicians and patients incorporating Signatera into their care. The study will enroll roughly 2000 patients who have undergone surgery from Stage I all the way up through Stage IV of CRC. The study\u2019s designed to measure real world clinical impact. How the test results impact clinical treatment decisions, as well as clinical outcomes. We believe this study will help drive positive Signatera coverage among private payers and we plan to be in position to start analyzing interim data in the fall this year, with a potential readout expected in the first half of 2023. Many of you will recall that we initiated these efforts back in 2020. So this is a great example of how our first-mover advantage can yield prospective clinical data that will be difficult for others to replicate upon entering the field. Moving on, at AACR this past April, we had two presentations for Signatera and breast cancer. The studies again demonstrated the strong prognostic value of ctDNA in triple-negative and HR-positive breast cancer. In a BEATRICE study of 186 patients conducted in partnership with Genentech, we showed that Signatera can detect recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer this time with lead times up to 30-months ahead of imaging. In the report from the I-SPY 2 Consortium, we analyzed over 700 time points from over 200 patients showing early clearance of ctDNA after just three weeks of neoadjuvant therapy is a significant predictor of pathologic complete response. This adds to the utility of Signatera in the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer in conjunction with imaging to help identify patients who are not responding to treatment and may benefit from an earlier change in strategy. We are also looking forward to a productive ASCO Conference this June where we will have seven posters presented. More information to come once the data embargoed -- once the data embargo is lifted. But right now, I can highlight that we will present data in lung cancer, breast cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma and renal cell. In the context of the strong clinical pipeline, I want to touch on a new industry draft guidance statement issued by FDA earlier this week on the use of ctDNA for early-stage solid tumor drug development. The FDA draft guidance document is a positive step for the industry and for Natera, because it lays out a pathway for drug developers to incorporate MRD testing into their clinical trials for early-stage solid tumors, both to enrich the intent to treat populations and to accelerate the trial readouts using ctDNA. The document specifically references the potential for using multiple ctDNA time points or serial testing to establish patient eligibility and the potential for ctDNA to be used as an early endpoint to support drug approval. Its written statement is in line with guidance that the FDA has previously communicated to Natera and to our drug development partners, which really helps solidify our vision of a world where Signatera will be used regularly across all phases of drug development to accelerate the approval of lifesaving therapies. We are still just at the beginning of that adoption curve. But I am pleased to say that our pharma pipeline continues to gain strength and diversity in addition to the Phase III trials IMvigor011 and ZEST that are currently enrolling. We have been engaged with the FDA on multiple fronts, including pre-submission meetings associated with our Breakthrough Device Designations, the investigational device exemption that we just received to enable to CIRCULATE U.S. trial and active participation in regulatory and industry consortia including Blood Pack and the Friends of Cancer Research. Finally, let us take a look at the coverage roadmap for Signatera. Nothing significant has changed on this slide since our last update. We have multiple submissions into Medicare for additional indications to be covered under the LCD and we are on track for our plan to get additional tumor types covered this year and next year. Meanwhile, we are making good progress towards gaining initial private payer coverage. Private payers are evaluating their own populations and starting to realize the benefits of covering Signatera, both to improve clinical outcomes and to improve the health economics. Again, we believe that the publication of the CIRCULATE-Japan data and potential inclusion into the NCCN guidelines can really help move the needle on that front. Now, I am going to hand the call over to Mike to review the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. The first slide here is just the financial detail also contained in the press release. Steve covered the major growth in revenues we have seen over the last year as we stood up the commercial teams for the transplant and oncology call points. The drop in licensing and other revenue just reflects the one-time of Qiagen in Q1 last year. So, pro forma for that result, the licensing and other lines also grew meaningfully year-over-year. It\u2019s the same story for gross margins. Note this comparison is pro forma for Qiagen. So you can see gross margins on a repeatable basis improved year-on-year. I think that\u2019s important to note because the gross margins are temporarily weighed down by all the Signatera volumes we are running, which implies continued strong gross margin leverage from the products in the transplant and women\u2019s health call points. A lot of patients are getting their first Signatera test compared to where we will be as the launch matures. This means currently a relatively high mix of people are getting expensive upfront exome, which should level out over time. One positive note is that we are already ahead of schedule this year on our ASP forecast for Signatera. Last year, you will recall Signatera ASPs were in the low 500s. We have seen a jump up into roughly the mid-600s so far this year, driven by expanded reimbursement and our Medicare mix in colorectal cancer continues to expand, as we reach further into the community setting. As we have talked about in the past, that is still an extremely immature ASP for this product, particularly in light of our new ADLT raise that Steve described. The future evolution of Signatera is clear to us. We see volume mix moving toward repeat plasma tests. The upfront setup costs going down and of course, we think there\u2019s a lot of progress to be made on ASPs as coverage expands and our patient mix reflects a higher mix of Medicare patients. The R&D and SG&A lines reflect key investments for the launch of large clinical trials and commercial channel expansion. I will spend more time on that in the next few slides. Note that cash burn was elevated in the quarter, largely due to timing dynamics. Q1 is usually a larger cash usage quarter for us. But that seasonal dynamic was amplified this year, because of the large increase in volumes we processed in March, so we experienced the cost of those tests and we booked the revenue, but it takes more than a couple of weeks for that testing volume increased to translate into cash. The overall cash burn guide for the year remains the same as I will cover on the next slide. Okay, great, let us get to the revised guidance. On revenues previously we were at $770 million to $790 million. We are resetting that range upward to $790 million to $810 million. We continue to see very strong sequential quarterly progress on Panorama and Horizon. In addition, we are very encouraged by the rapid volume uptake for Signatera and Prospera. Given that Signatera volume is ramping this quickly, you might expect this growth to result in near-term pressure on gross margins and cash. However, we feel comfortable holding these target study given the positive ASP trend for Signatera and the continued traction we are getting on the rest of the products. We are keeping the expense line guide flat, despite the higher revenues and volumes, because we are getting scale on these investments, as Steve described. And as a reminder, we expect to see the normal seasonality in women\u2019s health business for Q2 is stable versus Q1 and then Q3 and Q4 grow nicely. On the next slide, we have learned a lot in the last five quarters or so, as we have built out the commercial teams and grown the business dramatically. With those results in hand, we can now apply a lot of the forecasting rigor we have developed over the last decade and growing in NIPT. While we still have a lot of learn, we can now build the volume forecast bottoms up from sales territories based on our own experience. I think the recent results demonstrate that our existing products and commercial team can drive very significant volume growth for years to come. That means we should only need to grow. SG&A in the low-double digits over the next few years to support bigger territories and gain even more scale on the lab and shared functions of the business. This also means we can focus our R&D efforts on high ROIC projects, including version of the existing products, expanding the lab and investing in prospective clinical trials. While these projects require sizable initial investments, particularly in 2022, the results of these projects tend to be reasonably predictable, low technical risk and high ROIC endeavors. Those of you that followed us in the years from 2017 to 2019 know that similar R&D projects helped us drive gross margins from the low \u201830s to the high \u201840s that we are at today and we think we can do that again. So that\u2019s the background that informs the path to cash flow breakeven. Stable commercial team is poised to drive further growth in large under-penetrated market opportunities where we have already built a leadership position. We think we have a very clear path to get the cash flow breakeven between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in revenues over the next few years even with relatively minor improvements to our ASP and COGS. Our cash usage should go down steadily as we get closer to breakeven and we expect cash usage to go down meaningfully from 2022 to 2023. Over the longer term, we think there is substantially more revenue growth in our future and we believe long-term gross margins above 70% and operating margins above 25% are very achievable. So I think that lines up really well with our existing balance sheet and we feel like we are in a very good position to execute that plan. So with that, we are very excited about this quarter. Happy to share with you. I will hand it to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys. Good evening and congrats on the strong start to the year. Mike, maybe to kick things off, just a couple of points of clarification on the guide. Given that ADLT code bump that you mentioned for Signatera should we -- is that sort of fully factored in -- into the increase here or are there any offsets that we should be thinking about in terms of perhaps supply chain disruptions or samples shipping delays, et cetera, as we look at phasing through the year? And then the second part was on the cash burn reduction commentary that you just mentioned for 2023 and beyond. Can you just lay out sort of what\u2019s included there for perhaps building out that primary care channel for cancer screening and so on?\nMichael Brophy: Yeah. Sure Thanks for the question. So, first on the ADLT rate, that\u2019s a fantastic update of the business. That is incorporated in the guide for this year. But I will just remind you that you don\u2019t really to be the feel the full benefit of that ADLT rate in the volumes really even this year, because that is for the recurrence monitoring indication. So, first you start with Signatera in this adjuvant treatment window, which is the first six months that\u2019s kind of the bundle payment and once you graduate from that in -- you are in remission, then you are going to move to that recurrence monitoring time points. So as the base of business progresses over the next couple of years, an increase in percent of our volume is going to qualify for that ADLT rate. So, yes, it is incorporated in the guidance, but I think as the business needs to mature a little bit in order for you to see the full effect of that. So that\u2019s on the ASP. On the cash burn guide and the OpEx, this really -- what this contemplates is that kind of the current sales teams in place and just growing kind of modestly and not in relation to how fast the revenues have been growing. This does not contemplate a full build out or like a separate primary care call point nor would we anticipate that we would need to do that. So with regards to explain a carrier screening, lot of it would top there, a lot of technical work, a lot of technical hurdles to clear. But I -- we would just remind you that we feel very strongly we have got it fantastic primary care call point right now, because we have got the best OB-GYN channel in the United States. And I think longer term, we would hope to leverage that channel in the service of an expanded carrier screen. But, again, need to produce data first, need to make progress there before we make commitments on that front.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then on the base business, one of the questions that I recently got was just around implications of this Roe v. Wade, the decision would it be overturned by the Supreme Court and every state starts making its own laws. How do you see that impacting first a slope and also the eventual penetration that you can get to for average risk and IPD adoption? And then a quick follow-up on NIPT as well, any updates on that MGM partnership and how that has evolved since the news came out a couple of months ago?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Let me comment quickly on the Roe v. Wade and then maybe, Mike, you can talk about the things on the billing side. So, on the Roe v. Wade, I think, there are already states that have more restrictive policies and we haven\u2019t really seen any impacts on our NIPT testing overall. And just a reminder, there is a significant amount of benefits that people can get to improve care from getting NIPT, for example, with the George syndrome, treating the baby at birth with calcium could prevent hypocalcemia and prevent seizures. So I think the Roe v. Wade really doesn\u2019t factor in the vast majority of cases. But even in states where they are more restrictive we haven\u2019t seen an impact. Mike, do you want to take comment about billing?\nMichael Brophy: Yeah. Just on the billing side, I mean, we talked and linked on the March call in terms of the PA volume point to the vendor really has [Technical Difficulty] we turn the turn the page into 2022 because prior authorization is largely receding as a variable in the women\u2019s health business, now that there is going to full ACOG support for NIPT in all risk categories. So I expect that we will just continue to evolve the smaller piece of the business.\nTejas Savant: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Masucci from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nStephanie Yan: Hi. This is Stephanie Yan for Max Masucci. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. To start off, can you give us some detail about the volume and demand trends you have seen for your Empower offering and any cross selling trends you are seeing and more generally how some of the newer more targeted women\u2019s health offerings are being received?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. Sure. I will take that. So, Empower is a hereditary cancer testing. We are seeing there is interest from physicians to order that test from Natera. We did a pilot. I think in the kind of 2020 timeframe and then we did a full launch that in 2021. And we are seeing good uptick, particularly in the women\u2019s health sector, which I think is an area where we are poised to do well, just given our commercial footprint. And then on the remaining of women\u2019s health side, I mean, the vast majority of volume that we perform is Panorama noninvasive prenatal testing and then Horizon carrier screening testing. And we are still seeing the demand there would be very, very solid, because we have continued to support the products with a very significant amount of peer-reviewed data. One of the key highlights on the peer-reviewed data side was the publication of the SMART study for non-invasive prenatal testing. So that was actually published in the Gray Journal in January. I mean as -- I think everyone knows the SMART study was the largest multi-state prospective study that\u2019s ever been done in the field of non-invasive prenatal testing and the results were really just incredible. And we think that publishing peer-reviewed evidence is exceptionally important and that is driving uptick amongst the base.\nStephanie Yan: Got it. Super helpful. And also, as we see new draft and final coverage determination for the new cancer types in oncology and the new organs and transplant applications you are pursuing, can you give us a refresher around how long it takes to earn coverage under an umbrella LCD and what that implies or how quickly you can start getting paid and from the new indications in oncology and transplant pursue?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. So a couple of things, I think, with both transplant and oncology now do you have these umbrella coverage is in place. And so we -- in transplants today, we have coverage for kidney donor-derived cell-free DNA testing and then in oncology today, we have coverage for colorectal testing and then also immunotherapy monitoring. But with that said, we have done several additional submissions both across the organ health business and the oncology business. And generally, you hear back in the sort of roughly eight-week to the 12-week timeframe and then many times there\u2019s questions or additional information that they want and we follow through and submit that. I think that\u2019s sort of where we are right now either having just submitted or having just gotten feedback and kind of responded to questions. And so, ultimately, to my knowledge of -- I am not sure if there\u2019s any recent coverage decisions that have come out under the umbrella LCD. But I think we are sort of in the same boat with others where we are sort of interacting very positively and waiting for the additional coverage to come in.\nStephanie Yan: Got it. Thanks for that color and thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte from Baird. Your line is now open.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. I guess first and there\u2019s been a lot of noise around NIPT this year in the media between the New York Times report and the Short report. Are your reps hearing any doctors bring up either of those in the field or is this something that\u2019s largely insulated from your commercial work?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. I think the physicians are largely very supportive of screening and screening for aneuploidies has been a part of OB-GYN care for the past 40 years. So when you look at biochemical screening that really started in the 80s and unfortunately had a very low positive predictive value and an okay decent sensitivity. But the positive predictive value is only about 5%. So, with non-invasive prenatal testing because the positive predictive value is much higher, like we published 95% for trisomy 21, for example. There is other microdeletions orders where it\u2019s lower, like in the kind of 3% to 50% range in line with biochemical, but it\u2019s sort of right in there with what doctors have been experiencing. And so there is a strong support among the physician base for screening. The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends non-invasive prenatal testing and I think the doctors follow that and feel very supportive of what they are doing. We did notice that the volume has actually gone up quite significantly in the past four months, five months as we continue to publish data and process orders from physicians. But in addition, I think some physicians were frustrated about the way non-invasive testing and screening in general was characterized in the media and I think largely they disagree with how it was characterized.\nCatherine Schulte: All right. Very helpful. And then you mentioned seeing record volumes in recent weeks. It sounds like that business is going well, but any commercial repercussions from the recent news around the lawsuit with your competitor. And then how should we think about volume growth for your newer transplant indications this year?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. I mean we are feeling really positive right now, because we published 10 peer-reviewed papers in the last six months and I think largely that was the thing that was I think kind of holding us back in some ways, was that we had come in slightly later than others and we had less peer-reviewed data, but we are really closing that gap now and putting ourselves in a great position. I mean these are some of the most significant studies that have ever been done in the field. And I think what we are seeing as a result of the innovation in the peer-reviewed data is that physicians want to order the test and we are now, as we said, at record levels. I mean we are starting to see nice initial utilization in both heart and lung. We just published the two clinical validation studies there this kind of the last two months roughly and those were received very, very well by leading physicians and we have had a lot of great interaction. So we are feeling good about things. As far as pacing with long -- I think everybody is very early in line although there is a big opportunity there. It\u2019s a very underpenetrated market overall, not just for Natera. And I think for heart, there is a large, very deeply penetrated incumbent and it\u2019s -- we are trying to convince doctors to send us where we can, but I think just uphill battle there, but I think we are pleased with what we are seeing here in the early days.\nCatherine Schulte: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones from me, I will leave upfront and then hop back in the queue. But just Mike maybe and apologies if you covered some of this in the prepared remarks. Maybe just on the OpEx spend as you look forward, understanding that R&D is probably a little bit less flexible than SG&A. But as you think about some of the levers you can pull over the next one year to two years in terms of spend. Where do you see some of the best levers, is it given your commercial build-out that you have already done, is it on the SG&A side and how much flexibility do you think you have within the model? And then, sorry, just a question on Organ Health, I know you have had a couple of data releases. A reminder again about, I know it\u2019s just a big year for Organ Health data points, just how should we think about future data releases as we go through the course of this year? Thanks.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. I will give -- I will just hit the tops of the waves and Steve will outline to you for any additional commentary. I mean, I also do think there are some levers on the operating expense lines both for SG&A and R&D. I mean the one that comes immediately combines is the clinical trial spend. So, as Steve just touched on very briefly in the prepared remarks, it\u2019s kind of a bubble costs going on for large randomized and full trial [Technical Difficulty] make sure that business is well established and set up for the next 10 years. Steve mentioned Renasight as an example. But I think there are many others where you run that study and it\u2019s not necessarily a study, I mean, the SMART trial in the non-invasive prenatal testing space is a good historical example for us where that was a pretty expensive trial that we had to run for five years, but we don\u2019t have to run another trial like that. So a lot of that, those types of trials can start to roll off as soon as next year. I think there\u2019s a lot of leverage we can get from the work we have already done. And I think what is -- this is the same team that executed a growth strategy from 2015 to 2019. A lot of time the shares were at $8 and we had to be selective in the way that would be we managed the team. We [Technical Difficulty] kind of small things that you can do on the commercial side, that add up to winning that needed. So, Steve, do you have any other comments on that and I will let you take the second one as well.\nSteve Chapman: No. I think you covered it. And then on the Organ Health side, I mean, we said that there are going to be three really big data readouts this year. One on heart, one on lung and we have had both of those and I think they were both very positive. And then the next is one of the most significant trials ever done in donor derived cell-free DNA testing in kidney and that\u2019s the Trifecta study and that\u2019s in submission. That\u2019s going to be a very significant trial when it reads out. So we look forward to reporting that out later this year.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVB Securities. Your line is now open.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. So and congrats on a strong quarter here. So maybe for Steve first, I mean, I think, important question we have been getting from investors is, what steps have you taken around prioritization overall or what can you provide us on that end that sort of gives us confidence how those are being handled? And then maybe also any changes that you are taking across the company in terms of the sales approach or how you are approaching both sales and marketing on NIPT end and the Signatera end?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. Sure. So, I guess, I will comment briefly on the sales and marketing side. I think you think things are going very well. We have mentioned the Signatera clinical volumes are up. I think doctors are ordering the test at record levels. In fact, we are seeing that across oncology, across women\u2019s health and across Organ Health. So I think there\u2019s not really any changes there necessarily. I think it\u2019s largely sort of status quo. I think if the context of the question was, are we doing anything differently with regards to some of the sort of negative media attention. I would say in-- as we have mentioned previously, in the Organ Health space, we have removed any of the sort of reference materials that were part of the lawsuit and we don\u2019t expect those materials or the removal to have any impact on our ability to sell the product in any way. And in fact as you are seeing, we are seeing record numbers. So, Mike, do you want to talk about prior auths for a minute?\nMichael Brophy: Yeah. And just in interest of time I did get into cover a little bit earlier in the Q. I mean prior auths just as a piece of the business was already a small part of our overall volumes. And that\u2019s going to even smaller as we roll into 2022, because there are lot fewer prior authorization requirements out there just given the broad or a consequence of the products.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Got it. No. Thanks for clarifying that guys. We are -- when we speak with a number of KOLs that are utilizing your test, and as well as across the field as it goes into the community setting. There appears to be off-label use for the product, and obviously, physicians are excited. But maybe just can you give us a sense of where that stands today and how should we think about the progress versus from Signatera perspective, how should we think about the progress of indication expansion here, because it seems like the physicians are excited about the product, but they are obviously utilizing and levels that were beyond the current indication levels?\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. I will just say there is a difference between where the test is validated and where it\u2019s reimbursed. And so we are validated today for pan-cancer offering and we are seeing physicians order the test in a pan-cancer way, which is I think an indication of their excitement about the product. There are limited areas of reimbursement. But we published now more than 15 peer-reviewed papers across. I think more than 15 different cancer types, 3,000 different patients and so forth. So we are not surprised to see physicians using it in line with a lot of the data that\u2019s out there on the performance of the test. Solomon, do you want to talk a little bit about the pipeline and kind of what we are doing to generate more data and to get additional reimbursement?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Yeah. Just before I do that, I want to emphasize how much continued growth in adoption we are seeing in the core covered indications in early Stage CRC Stage II and III, and resectable Stage IV in pan-cancer immunotherapy monitoring. In addition to, as you mentioned growth that we are seeing in other indications where physicians who have already experienced the test, let say, in early-stage CRC if you are a community physician and then a breast cancer patient comes along, where you are facing a similar challenging decision, where you are thinking through different treatment options and trying to evaluate a patient\u2019s risk in that positioned, it\u2019s really easy now for the physician to think about Signatera and order that test. And in terms of our pipeline, I-- we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we are continuing to produce a significant amount of clinical validation data, much of which is being shared with MolDX and package it up for reimbursement with Medicare, but also being increasingly with private payers. And we have always said that guideline inclusion, we think will be the most important inflection point for coverage with private payers and we think we have a good opportunity to see that first one later this year or early next year as we discussed in CRC.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Got it. And then just last question, in terms of ASCO, I don\u2019t know if you have provided updates, but should we be expecting anything in ASCO? Thanks guys.\nSolomon Moshkevich: Yeah. We showed in the prepared remarks, we have got 10 abstracts and seven posters and we look forward to sharing more data on those when the embargo is lifted.\nPuneet Souda: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Mikson from Canaccord. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the great quarter. This is [inaudible] on for Kyle Mikson. Quick question, so in mid-April, the FDA published a safety communication titled genetic non-invasive prenatal screening tests and they have false results. Do you believe that things may progress in such a way that the FDA starts to regulate LDTs [ph] in this space? And my second question is, I recently read some publications suggest a growing trend of first-time mothers age 35 or older, coupled with a higher rate of Down syndrome. I guess the first question, that would be, is this what also you are seeing older first-time others and do you feel that the changing demographic could drive material growth of the NIPT market as a whole in the near-term? Thank you so much.\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. So on the FDA, I would say, we strongly support the information shared recently by the FDA with regards to NIPT and we have always believed that education and transparency in peer-reviewed evidence are very important and that\u2019s why we published 26 peer-reviewed papers on NIPT including SMART study, which is the largest study ever performed and we employ over 100 genetic counselors and offer complementary genetic counseling sessions pre- and post-test to all patients. We also put the negative predictive value and the positive predictive value of each disorder directly on each report. So because of that, we are in a great position to work more closely with the FDA, given the breadth of our data and the depths of our validation studies. So again, we really support the information shared by the FDA. With regards to changing demographics, things are sort of evolving, it does appear over in the past many years towards a slightly older birth rate and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an advantage or a disadvantage. But it hasn\u2019t impacted us in a negative way and we continue to grow, NIPT is still under-penetrated, we think only about 40% roughly at pregnancies today are getting NIPT testing, where else vast majority of patients still get biochemical screening, which has a positive predictive value that is significantly less than that of NIPT.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. We have made significant commercial progress so far this year in oncology, as more physicians adopt Signatera and as each physician gains experience and then starts to apply the test across more and more of their patients. We have laid the groundwork over the past five years to be in a position that we are in now, where we are also presenting high-quality clinical data at nearly every major Academic Oncology Conference on the calendar and expecting to publish over 20 peer-reviewed publications this year. One case in point is the CIRCULATE-Japan trial that Steve mentioned earlier. The latest presentation at the SSO conference this year updated the analysis to show recurrence detection in stage II and III CRC at a single time at four weeks post-op of 75%, compared to the 68% that was presented earlier in January. This was in addition to the groundbreaking predictive data, where MRD positive patients clearly benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, while MRD negative patients saw no significant benefit. Getting this data submitted for publication is an important milestone, because we think it's a publication will improve the odds of NCCN guideline inclusion, which in turn could drive another inflection point in test adoption and coverage. We were also pleased to announce the launch of the prospective randomized circulate U.S. trial, which is now open for enrollment across the country. If successful, study will add further evidence on top of the Japanese trial to definitively prove that Stage III CRC patients who test Signatera negative will not benefit from additional treatment. In Q1, we also announced a key milestone in our bespoke CRC registry trial, which now has more than 1,000 patients enrolled at over 100 sites. The pace of enrollment in this study has been strong, which reflects the excitement in the field from both physicians and patients incorporating Signatera into their care. The study will enroll roughly 2000 patients who have undergone surgery from Stage I all the way up through Stage IV of CRC. The study's designed to measure real world clinical impact. How the test results impact clinical treatment decisions, as well as clinical outcomes. We believe this study will help drive positive Signatera coverage among private payers and we plan to be in position to start analyzing interim data in the fall this year, with a potential readout expected in the first half of 2023. Many of you will recall that we initiated these efforts back in 2020. So this is a great example of how our first-mover advantage can yield prospective clinical data that will be difficult for others to replicate upon entering the field. Moving on, at AACR this past April, we had two presentations for Signatera and breast cancer. The studies again demonstrated the strong prognostic value of ctDNA in triple-negative and HR-positive breast cancer. In a BEATRICE study of 186 patients conducted in partnership with Genentech, we showed that Signatera can detect recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer this time with lead times up to 30-months ahead of imaging. In the report from the I-SPY 2 Consortium, we analyzed over 700 time points from over 200 patients showing early clearance of ctDNA after just three weeks of neoadjuvant therapy is a significant predictor of pathologic complete response. This adds to the utility of Signatera in the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer in conjunction with imaging to help identify patients who are not responding to treatment and may benefit from an earlier change in strategy. We are also looking forward to a productive ASCO Conference this June where we will have seven posters presented. More information to come once the data embargoed -- once the data embargo is lifted. But right now, I can highlight that we will present data in lung cancer, breast cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma and renal cell. In the context of the strong clinical pipeline, I want to touch on a new industry draft guidance statement issued by FDA earlier this week on the use of ctDNA for early-stage solid tumor drug development. The FDA draft guidance document is a positive step for the industry and for Natera, because it lays out a pathway for drug developers to incorporate MRD testing into their clinical trials for early-stage solid tumors, both to enrich the intent to treat populations and to accelerate the trial readouts using ctDNA. The document specifically references the potential for using multiple ctDNA time points or serial testing to establish patient eligibility and the potential for ctDNA to be used as an early endpoint to support drug approval. Its written statement is in line with guidance that the FDA has previously communicated to Natera and to our drug development partners, which really helps solidify our vision of a world where Signatera will be used regularly across all phases of drug development to accelerate the approval of lifesaving therapies. We are still just at the beginning of that adoption curve. But I am pleased to say that our pharma pipeline continues to gain strength and diversity in addition to the Phase III trials IMvigor011 and ZEST that are currently enrolling. We have been engaged with the FDA on multiple fronts, including pre-submission meetings associated with our Breakthrough Device Designations, the investigational device exemption that we just received to enable to CIRCULATE U.S. trial and active participation in regulatory and industry consortia including Blood Pack and the Friends of Cancer Research. Finally, let us take a look at the coverage roadmap for Signatera. Nothing significant has changed on this slide since our last update. We have multiple submissions into Medicare for additional indications to be covered under the LCD and we are on track for our plan to get additional tumor types covered this year and next year. Meanwhile, we are making good progress towards gaining initial private payer coverage. Private payers are evaluating their own populations and starting to realize the benefits of covering Signatera, both to improve clinical outcomes and to improve the health economics. Again, we believe that the publication of the CIRCULATE-Japan data and potential inclusion into the NCCN guidelines can really help move the needle on that front. Now, I am going to hand the call over to Mike to review the financials. Mike? Sure. Yeah. Just before I do that, I want to emphasize how much continued growth in adoption we are seeing in the core covered indications in early Stage CRC Stage II and III, and resectable Stage IV in pan-cancer immunotherapy monitoring. In addition to, as you mentioned growth that we are seeing in other indications where physicians who have already experienced the test, let say, in early-stage CRC if you are a community physician and then a breast cancer patient comes along, where you are facing a similar challenging decision, where you are thinking through different treatment options and trying to evaluate a patient's risk in that positioned, it's really easy now for the physician to think about Signatera and order that test. And in terms of our pipeline, I-- we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we are continuing to produce a significant amount of clinical validation data, much of which is being shared with MolDX and package it up for reimbursement with Medicare, but also being increasingly with private payers. And we have always said that guideline inclusion, we think will be the most important inflection point for coverage with private payers and we think we have a good opportunity to see that first one later this year or early next year as we discussed in CRC. Yeah. We showed in the prepared remarks, we have got 10 abstracts and seven posters and we look forward to sharing more data on those when the embargo is lifted."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Let us get into the highlights on slide three. As you can all see from the press release, we had another stellar growth quarter in Q1. Total revenue came in at $194 million, driven by strong volume and ASPs. Year-on-year product revenues increased by roughly 58% and 14% sequentially from Q4. Pro forma for the one-time $28 million Qiagen benefit in Q1 of last year, total revenues were also up 57%. Test process grew north of 40% year-on-year and more than 10% sequentially versus Q4 of last year. Keep in mind, this should be tough comparisons. 2021 was a breakout year for Natera and yet the business continues to accelerate. We will get into the drivers shortly, but we are seeing excellent growth across the business, especially in oncology with our Signatera clinical volumes. Given the traction, we are seeing in late Q1 and so far in Q2, we are able to raise our revenue guidance for the year. We started the year at $770 million to $790 million, and we are now forecasting total revenue of $790 million $810 million for the year. We are rapidly getting operating leverage on the investments we have been making in R&D and commercial channels, which has given us more clarity on when we can get to cash flow breakeven. Mike will spend more time on this later in the call. As a reflection of our confidence in the company and the substantial upside value creation we have achieved -- we believe is achievable, the Board, executive leadership and I opted to take our compensation in stock for the balance of the year. Our lead independent director also bought 5 million in shares on the open market. On the heels of a strong 2021, our first quarter results show we are firing on all cylinders and our increased guidance shows we are confident in our ability to maintain the momentum. Turning to a few notable highlights from the quarter, we have had a slew of exciting milestones in our transplant business, which has seen record volume levels on the back of 10 peer-reviewed papers published in the past roughly six months. We have recently announced the publication of VALID study a prospective clinical validation of Prospera1, we announced a 1,000 patient real-world study with Renasight and we announced a multi-site clinical validation of Prospera Heart was published in the Journal of Heart and Lung transplantation, a leading Journal in this space. A few weeks ago, we were also very pleased to announce that Dr. Sangeeta Bhorade joined us as Vice President of Organ Health Medical Affairs. Dr. Bhorade is a leading academic physician in the lung transplant space having founded the Lung Transplant Program at the University of Chicago and separately at Northwestern. Dr. Bhorade joined Natera is the latest addition among other recent notable medical leadership hires including Dr. Michael Olymbios, Medical Director of Heart Transplantation and Dr. David Ross, Medical Director of Lung Transplantation. Dr. Olymbios was previously a member of the Heart Transplant program at Cedars Sinai and the author of many peer-reviewed publications in heart transplant. Dr. David Ross is an academic transplant pulmonologist credited with starting one of the first lung transplant programs at Cedars Sinai in 1989 and has served as the Medical Director of the Lung Transplant Program and Professor of Medicine at UCLA. We also continue to make excellent progress in oncology. We were very pleased to see an update in the landmark circulate data in an oral presentation at the Society of Surgical Oncology 2022. The key update there was Signatera is now showing a 75% detection of recurrence in Stage II and III patients with a single time point MRD blood draw at four weeks post-surgery versus the previous analysis from ASCO GI in January, which showed a single time point detection of 68%. Also, the circulate papers now in submission to a top tier medical journal, which is incredibly exciting. As we have said before, getting the paper published was a key step on the path to NCCN guidelines. So I am really proud of our collaborators and the Natera team for moving so quickly to get the paper submitted. In addition, we have had some good breast cancer data presented recently at AACR further validating Signatera performance in triple-negative in HR-positive diseases in collaboration with Genentech in their I-SPY 2 consortium. And we also have an exciting lineup coming to ASCO this year. On the Signatera reimbursement front, we completed the first pricing measurement period for our ADLT rates since the price was initially established at $3500 last year. As of April 1, 2022, the ADLT rate for Signatera has now been revised upward to $3,920. Obviously, that gives an immediate boost to Medicare reimburse volumes, but I think it also strengthens our position with commercial payers over time. Moving to slide four, let us get into some of the trends. The next slide is a longer run view of our quarterly volume progression. I think this view gives helpful context to the rapid progress we have made. For example, you can see the volumes are more than twice of what they were as recently as Q1 of 2020. Of course, a big reason why we have been outperforming is the product launches in oncology and Organ Health are progressing well above our expectations. For Signatera, we have seen tremendous growth, particularly in the clinical volumes. We have gotten a significant boost from the ASCO GI circulate presentation colorectal cancer and we are still seeing significant organic uptake across a broad range of cancer types of work -- as word of mouth spreads. Clinical ASPs are also ahead of plan. We had a hypothesis that our Medicare mix might increase as we got further into our launch and received more community-based units. That appears to be happening. We are rapidly getting scale on the investment that we made in our oncology commercial channel and Mike will spend more time on this later in the call. We had a great quarter for the Organ Health products as well, particularly in kidney transplants and we are just starting to see the benefit from our efforts in the other organ types as well. That strength is continued and we are currently seeing record Prospera volume levels over the past several weeks. These results clearly demonstrate that we are on track and more broadly, I think the concept of cell-free DNA is a tool for monitoring graft health is taking hold. On the next slide, you can see the revenue trajectory has outpaced the volume trends, as we benefited from positive overall ASP trends over the past few years. The left hand side of the slide shows the year-on-year revenue growth we have seen in Q1 versus prior years and clearly Q1 of 2022 was very strong. The right-hand side puts into perspective the revenue trajectory of the business has been on just the last four quarters. As these new products are starting to ramp, we are very encouraged to see that we are quickly getting leverage on the channels we have built in transplant and oncology and Mike will talk more about that later in the call. Okay, let me cover a few slides on our recent progress in Organ Health. We are now seeing the fruits of our labor with data generation in Organ Health having published 10 peer-reviewed papers in roughly the past six months. On the next slide, our DEDUCE study in heart transplant was published in the Journal of Heart and Lung transplantation, a premier high impact journal in this space. This multi-site clinical validation study Prospera Heart demonstrated the test ability to identify acute rejection in heart transplant patients with an AUC of 0.87 in the perspectives arm of the study, which included more than 700 samples. We are continuing to build robust medical evidence with our ongoing NIH-supported DTR study and the Natera-sponsored DETECT randomized controlled trial. I want to spend a bit more time on Renasight, which is a test we haven't spent a lot of time on in the past. Renasight is a hereditary gene panel that addresses the large market opportunity in chronic kidney disease. There are approximately 37 million patients in the United States living with chronic kidney disease and about 750,000 patients are newly diagnosed per year. In 2019, a large scale validation study of multi-gene testing was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and showed that about 10% of chronic kidney disease patients have a genetic etiology and of those 89% would have had a change in clinical care as a result of their genetic test. This is exceptionally high clinical utility, a very large area of health care. To-date testing has been mostly offered on a limited basis with an academic centers. We introduced Renasight to the nephrology and transplant community, because we thought we could make a big impact on patient care by making genetic testing accessible at scale. Our first study for Renasight was published in the American Journal of Nephrology analyzing the commercial experience of the first 1000 tests with positive findings found at 21% of patients tested. We also had previously invested into a large scale definitive multi-site prospective trial called RenaCARE and are excited to say that we are almost finished with enrollment. RenaCARE will access the clinical utility of Renasight and we actually expect to submit the results of the study for publication in late 2022. I want to make one other comment about our financials before I turn the call over. The RenaCARE study is a good example of a larger trend in our overall business where in many cases we pre-invested into a big future opportunity. While this impacts our near-term operating expenses, many of these are one-time expenses, like RenaCARE where the trial cost goes away once the study is over, but the longer term upside opportunity remains. Another example of this is the randomized controlled trials we are doing in heart and lung transplants. Once those are done, you don't have to do them again or similarly we have invested in a very talented nationwide oncology sales force, despite they being very underpenetrated in their geographies. This creates leverage because now, operating expenses can stay relatively stable as volumes grow and we can charter path to cash flow breakeven. Mike will give more details on this in his section later in the call. With that, let me now hand the call over to Solomon to provide an update on oncology. Solomon? Yes. Let me comment quickly on the Roe v. Wade and then maybe, Mike, you can talk about the things on the billing side. So, on the Roe v. Wade, I think, there are already states that have more restrictive policies and we haven't really seen any impacts on our NIPT testing overall. And just a reminder, there is a significant amount of benefits that people can get to improve care from getting NIPT, for example, with the George syndrome, treating the baby at birth with calcium could prevent hypocalcemia and prevent seizures. So I think the Roe v. Wade really doesn't factor in the vast majority of cases. But even in states where they are more restrictive we haven't seen an impact. Mike, do you want to take comment about billing? Yeah. Sure. I will take that. So, Empower is a hereditary cancer testing. We are seeing there is interest from physicians to order that test from Natera. We did a pilot. I think in the kind of 2020 timeframe and then we did a full launch that in 2021. And we are seeing good uptick, particularly in the women's health sector, which I think is an area where we are poised to do well, just given our commercial footprint. And then on the remaining of women's health side, I mean, the vast majority of volume that we perform is Panorama noninvasive prenatal testing and then Horizon carrier screening testing. And we are still seeing the demand there would be very, very solid, because we have continued to support the products with a very significant amount of peer-reviewed data. One of the key highlights on the peer-reviewed data side was the publication of the SMART study for non-invasive prenatal testing. So that was actually published in the Gray Journal in January. I mean as -- I think everyone knows the SMART study was the largest multi-state prospective study that's ever been done in the field of non-invasive prenatal testing and the results were really just incredible. And we think that publishing peer-reviewed evidence is exceptionally important and that is driving uptick amongst the base. Yeah. So a couple of things, I think, with both transplant and oncology now do you have these umbrella coverage is in place. And so we -- in transplants today, we have coverage for kidney donor-derived cell-free DNA testing and then in oncology today, we have coverage for colorectal testing and then also immunotherapy monitoring. But with that said, we have done several additional submissions both across the organ health business and the oncology business. And generally, you hear back in the sort of roughly eight-week to the 12-week timeframe and then many times there's questions or additional information that they want and we follow through and submit that. I think that's sort of where we are right now either having just submitted or having just gotten feedback and kind of responded to questions. And so, ultimately, to my knowledge of -- I am not sure if there's any recent coverage decisions that have come out under the umbrella LCD. But I think we are sort of in the same boat with others where we are sort of interacting very positively and waiting for the additional coverage to come in. Yeah. I think the physicians are largely very supportive of screening and screening for aneuploidies has been a part of OB-GYN care for the past 40 years. So when you look at biochemical screening that really started in the 80s and unfortunately had a very low positive predictive value and an okay decent sensitivity. But the positive predictive value is only about 5%. So, with non-invasive prenatal testing because the positive predictive value is much higher, like we published 95% for trisomy 21, for example. There is other microdeletions orders where it's lower, like in the kind of 3% to 50% range in line with biochemical, but it's sort of right in there with what doctors have been experiencing. And so there is a strong support among the physician base for screening. The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends non-invasive prenatal testing and I think the doctors follow that and feel very supportive of what they are doing. We did notice that the volume has actually gone up quite significantly in the past four months, five months as we continue to publish data and process orders from physicians. But in addition, I think some physicians were frustrated about the way non-invasive testing and screening in general was characterized in the media and I think largely they disagree with how it was characterized. Yeah. I mean we are feeling really positive right now, because we published 10 peer-reviewed papers in the last six months and I think largely that was the thing that was I think kind of holding us back in some ways, was that we had come in slightly later than others and we had less peer-reviewed data, but we are really closing that gap now and putting ourselves in a great position. I mean these are some of the most significant studies that have ever been done in the field. And I think what we are seeing as a result of the innovation in the peer-reviewed data is that physicians want to order the test and we are now, as we said, at record levels. I mean we are starting to see nice initial utilization in both heart and lung. We just published the two clinical validation studies there this kind of the last two months roughly and those were received very, very well by leading physicians and we have had a lot of great interaction. So we are feeling good about things. As far as pacing with long -- I think everybody is very early in line although there is a big opportunity there. It's a very underpenetrated market overall, not just for Natera. And I think for heart, there is a large, very deeply penetrated incumbent and it's -- we are trying to convince doctors to send us where we can, but I think just uphill battle there, but I think we are pleased with what we are seeing here in the early days. No. I think you covered it. And then on the Organ Health side, I mean, we said that there are going to be three really big data readouts this year. One on heart, one on lung and we have had both of those and I think they were both very positive. And then the next is one of the most significant trials ever done in donor derived cell-free DNA testing in kidney and that's the Trifecta study and that's in submission. That's going to be a very significant trial when it reads out. So we look forward to reporting that out later this year. Yeah. Sure. So, I guess, I will comment briefly on the sales and marketing side. I think you think things are going very well. We have mentioned the Signatera clinical volumes are up. I think doctors are ordering the test at record levels. In fact, we are seeing that across oncology, across women's health and across Organ Health. So I think there's not really any changes there necessarily. I think it's largely sort of status quo. I think if the context of the question was, are we doing anything differently with regards to some of the sort of negative media attention. I would say in-- as we have mentioned previously, in the Organ Health space, we have removed any of the sort of reference materials that were part of the lawsuit and we don't expect those materials or the removal to have any impact on our ability to sell the product in any way. And in fact as you are seeing, we are seeing record numbers. So, Mike, do you want to talk about prior auths for a minute? Yeah. I will just say there is a difference between where the test is validated and where it's reimbursed. And so we are validated today for pan-cancer offering and we are seeing physicians order the test in a pan-cancer way, which is I think an indication of their excitement about the product. There are limited areas of reimbursement. But we published now more than 15 peer-reviewed papers across. I think more than 15 different cancer types, 3,000 different patients and so forth. So we are not surprised to see physicians using it in line with a lot of the data that's out there on the performance of the test. Solomon, do you want to talk a little bit about the pipeline and kind of what we are doing to generate more data and to get additional reimbursement? Yeah. So on the FDA, I would say, we strongly support the information shared recently by the FDA with regards to NIPT and we have always believed that education and transparency in peer-reviewed evidence are very important and that's why we published 26 peer-reviewed papers on NIPT including SMART study, which is the largest study ever performed and we employ over 100 genetic counselors and offer complementary genetic counseling sessions pre- and post-test to all patients. We also put the negative predictive value and the positive predictive value of each disorder directly on each report. So because of that, we are in a great position to work more closely with the FDA, given the breadth of our data and the depths of our validation studies. So again, we really support the information shared by the FDA. With regards to changing demographics, things are sort of evolving, it does appear over in the past many years towards a slightly older birth rate and I don't know if that's an advantage or a disadvantage. But it hasn't impacted us in a negative way and we continue to grow, NIPT is still under-penetrated, we think only about 40% roughly at pregnancies today are getting NIPT testing, where else vast majority of patients still get biochemical screening, which has a positive predictive value that is significantly less than that of NIPT."

We will quote a number of numerical growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. Natera is focused on transforming the diagnosis and management of disease worldwide. Our growth is driven by combining our innovative technology with significant peer reviewed clinical evidence that supports the utility of our products. We've had a lot of great news since our presentation at the JPMorgan conference and we're excited to get into the highlights. We finished Q4 with $311 million of revenue, which was $11 million ahead of the preannouncement we made in January and represents 43% growth over Q4 of 2022. Full year revenues were $1.080 billion an increase of more than 30% compared to 2022. On volumes, we processed 2,496,000 tests in 2023, which is roughly 6,000 units ahead of the preannouncement. We processed 341,000 oncology tests in 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 73.5% and we also saw strong growth metrics in women's health and organ health. Gross margins in Q4 came in at 51.4%, compared to our Q1 margin of 39.9%. We finished the full year at 45.5% above the top end of the Q3 guide. As Mike will cover later in the call, we had some revenue true ups and lab savings in Q4 that don't repeat every quarter. We estimate organic revenues in Q4 were roughly $306 million and gross margins were roughly 49%, which still represents a significant improvement versus previous quarters. And as we discussed at the JPMorgan conference, we also made great progress on cash burn throughout the course of the year, ultimately reducing our cash burn by roughly $193 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The guidance for 2024 reflects the continued momentum in the business that generated these very strong results in 2023. We are guiding revenues of $1.320 billion to $1.350 billion gross margins of 50% to 53% and cash burn for the full year of $50 million to $75 million. On cash, we estimate we will be cash flow breakeven by Q3 or sooner. What's most impressive is we will be achieving this cash flow breakeven quarter while still making very significant investments into our core business. You'll see later in the guidance that our investment in research and development and commercial operations remains robust in 2024. This includes major investments in core product enhancements and line extensions, plus potentially guideline enabling clinical trials that we believe could benefit patients in the years to come. We can do this because our core fundamentals are so strong. We're in large expanding markets, our volume is growing rapidly and our margin is expanding with ASP increasing and COGS going down. I'll now hit a few other highlights before we go into more details on each. First, we think our recent acquisition of Invitae's women's health assets is well timed given the clinical value of expanded carrier screening and the strong trends we are seeing there and we're feeling positive about our progress on the acquisition thus far. In organ health, we're building momentum as we complete enrollment and readout major innovative clinical trials. We'll be talking today about some big first of their kind perspective studies in donor derived cell free DNA and how they may positively impact patient care. Finally, in oncology, earlier this week, we were pleased to announce that the MolDX has expanded coverage for Signatera to neoadjuvant monitoring in breast cancer and separately for MRD and recurrence monitoring in ovarian cancer. We've had a drumbeat of exciting clinical developments across a range of indications including CRC, muscle invasive bladder cancer and breast cancer. I'm excited for Alex to also talk about the modern study in bladder cancer, which just enrolled its first patient a few weeks ago. Finally, we've had a string of good results on the IP front that I think puts us in an excellent position in 2024 and beyond. Okay, great. Let's get into details of the results on the next slide. Revenues exceeded our expectations at $311 million driven by continued strong volume growth and excellent ASP traction across the business, particularly in women's health and oncology. We previously had a goal to get oncology ASPs above $1,000 by the end of 2024 and we actually hit that level in Q4 of 2023. That's great news because we now think we can get a full year's benefit of higher ASPs in 2024 and we think there's still room to drive Signatera clinical ASPs another $50 to $75 higher just by continuing to execute on currently covered indications. Of course, this week's announcement on new Medicare coverage will help us as well. The commentary on women's health ASPs is broadly similar. We saw encouraging sequential quarterly progress throughout the course of 2023 and preliminary analysis of Q1 trends suggest that we are on track for continued improvement so far in 2024. Volume was a strong driver of Q4 performance as well and you can see the annual volume trend on the next slide. As mentioned earlier, we came in 61,000 units ahead of our preannouncement in January. I have a separate slide on oncology coming up, so I'll focus on women's health and organ health here where we saw strong growth in the full year 2023. As the year ended, we saw an acceleration of women's health including hitting a record units per receiving day in December. This strong momentum carried into January as well and that was prior to the acquisition of Invitae's women's health assets where we're just now starting to see volume come in. In organ health, as the year progressed, we saw a return to growth in the donor derived cell free DNA business after the initial pullback in early 2023 due to the coverage changes. We think we're well positioned going forward in donor derived cell free DNA to compete given the significant body of peer reviewed evidence that we generated and the unique features of our tests. Also, we continue to see strong interest in Renasight after the RenaCARE publication. This momentum is great and we're off to a fast start across women's health, organ health and oncology. On the next slide, we're showing the ramp of our oncology business, which continues to outperform. In Q4, we did 98,000 units, another strong sequential quarter increasing by 9,000 clinical units over Q3 of 2023. For the full year of 2023, the growth rate was 73.5% over 2022. We're continuing to see strong growth across the core indications including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, muscle invasive bladder cancer and immunotherapy monitoring even as we add new indications. Roughly 40% of oncologists used Signatera in Q4, which shows the strong clinical utility of the test and we have strong momentum going into 2024. Just as critical as revenue and volume growth is the gross margin traction we are seeing. I think this slide is a good snapshot of the business maturing. Over the course of the year, our ASP and COGS initiatives delivered above our expectations, particularly in Signatera, ASP and COGS, both of which improved over the course of 2023. As I mentioned at the top of the call, we think the underlying repeatable gross margin in the quarter was roughly 49%. Our 2024 guide implies meaningful continued gross margin improvements based on ASPs and cost drivers that are within our control. In addition, we've also got a number of potential upside drivers to both revenue and gross margin that we'll discuss later in the call that aren't included in our guide. So the net result of strong revenue growth and expanding margins on stable operating expenses is a dramatic reduction in cash burn we achieved in 2023. This is essentially in line with the data we released in January. As discussed previously, we accelerated a chunk of 2024 scheduled CapEx in December to take advantage of some large year-end discounts, which has helped us set up for an efficient year in 2024. Two years ago, we set a long-term target to get a cash flow breakeven quarter this year and based on these results plus the early data we are seeing so far in Q1, we are confident that we can reach that milestone by Q3 of this year if not sooner. Of course, cash flows are dependent in part on payer response times to submitted claims and so are inherently difficult to forecast with precision on a quarterly basis. But the point is that we're continuing to build momentum and our confidence in achieving this goal is stronger than ever. Finally, I think anyone that follows this space has taken note of our results on the IP front. Since we created the category of tumor informed MRD in 2017, we've had 2 companies attempt to follow us into the space, requiring us to enforce our IP against them. The good news is that they've now both been enjoined for violating our IP. The permanent injunction against Archer and Invitae was ordered after the conclusion of a jury trial and then subsequently a preliminary injunction was entered against NeoGenomics. One notable point about these results is that different sets of patents and different judges are at issue in each of these cases, which I think demonstrates the strength of the IP estate that protects our core technology. The Natera's IP litigation offers another case in point, which generated a sizable jury verdict for damages based only on past infringement of our patents. The process is still ongoing to determine whether future royalties will be awarded. And on the Ravgen trial, we were found to not willfully infringe and the damages awarded were obviously much lower than what Ravgen was requesting, but we still respectfully disagree with the outcomes of the trial and we plan to appeal certain of the rulings. Okay. Now, let me hand it over to Solomon to discuss updates in women's health and organ health. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks Steve. Let's start with the Invitae deal. First, recall we secured a judgment on past damages in our Archer IP litigation of roughly $20 million. We anticipated that it could be difficult to collect that amount from Invitae given their financial issues. So we applied that judgment amount as part of the consideration in this deal. We also paid Invitae $10 million upfront and if we have excellent retention of Invitae's accounts, there's a potential milestone payment that we can make of up to $22.5 million. We would be very happy to make that payment because it would mean that the deal is working extremely well for us. As a reminder, we did not take on any of Invitae's products, its lab operations, nor its physical assets. We did hire roughly 30 of their women's health sales reps and our goal is to provide a seamless transition of those Invitae accounts to Natera's Panorama and Horizon products. Our team is working hard to retain as much volume as we can and we're doing well. We expect to retain at least $20 million to $25 million in high quality recurring revenue per year, but we think there is a potential to increase that up to $50 million to $60 million depending on how things go, especially if we see clinical practice guidelines for expanded carrier screening or 22q, which we think could come as soon as this spring and would provide upside to these numbers. So we think the deal rationale is strong and we look forward to providing more updates as the year progresses. One of the keys to our offering in women's health is our highly differentiated screening test for the 22q microdeletion. As 22q goes into societal guidelines and becomes commonplace as we believe it will, the differentiation that Natera has in its 22q test is going to become increasingly valuable. When we run our test, we're using our core SNP-based technology that allows us to target this very small region of the genome, which is around 2.5 to 3 megabases. This allows us to get over 25x more observations in this particular region of interest than companies doing massively parallel shotgun sequencing, which creates a significant technical advantage that has translated into excellent clinical performance as demonstrated in the SMART trial. We think the SMART trial represents the gold standard in clinical validation that would be very hard to repeat. As a reminder, SMART was a 7-year multicenter prospective trial that enrolled more than 20,000 patients and collected genetic outcomes from prenatal specimens and newborn blood spots. In this trial, Panorama demonstrated overall clinical sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 99.95%, which translates to PPV of 52.6% overall and a PPV of 100% in cases with ultrasound anomalies. As 22q has gotten more attention in the wake of a strong guideline from ACMG and anticipated guidelines from ACOG, we have noticed competitors starting to present datasets with PPV metrics that look high, but with screen positive rates that are low or completely unreported. In one report from a lab doing shotgun sequencing, the screen positive rate was approximately 1 in 6,500, which is 3 or 4 times lower than the expected population incidence, suggesting that they might be missing a significant number of affected pregnancies. In addition, other labs are making comparative claims based on patient cohorts that had very high rates of ultrasound findings, where we saw PPV of 100% in the SMART trial, as I mentioned previously. In our view, a test is not appropriate for population screening if you don't know the clinical sensitivity and [indiscernible]. These are typical marketing tactics that we've seen before and we do think physicians will see through it. Moving now into carrier screening, we've seen really strong adoption in the past year and we believe we're the number one ordered next gen sequencing based carrier screening test in the United States. Our mix of broader panels increased after the exit of 704 from the market in late 2022. And we are finding that quite a few of the new transitioning Invitae accounts also have a strong mix of broad panels. So in addition to our existing portfolio, we are really pleased to be launching a new 613 gene panel and a totally flexible custom panel option to serve these customers. Horizon provides high detection across all genes, including the challenging ones where other labs may struggle. With these new panels together with our investments in variant curation, our genetic counselor team and lab automation, we think Horizon is well positioned to remain a leader in the field. Broad panel carrier screening is also a hot topic for ACOG, where we expect to see an expanded guideline in 2024. Turning now to organ health, where we are excited about the prospects for 2024 and beyond. We think the strength of our clinical data, our commercial execution and our intellectual property estate enables us to compete for the leadership position in this space. Our clinical data generation in organ health has been prodigious in the last 5 years, where we now have 39 papers published or accepted in top journals. In the heart indication, we recently had our third paper accepted for publication, the Trifecta Heart Study, which demonstrated strong correlation between Prospera and endomyocardial biopsy assessed with the molecular microscope. Reporting an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. You can see in these 3 high quality data sets on the page the consistent performance across the Trifecta, DTRT and DEDUCE trials, including in adults and pediatrics. This performance laid the foundation for us to start the randomized controlled ACES trial, which aims to show the non-inferiority of using surveillance with Prospera compared to surveillance biopsies that most centers do on a monthly basis in the first year after a heart transplant. Sites are preparing for their first enrollment this summer. Now in the kidney transplant space, we have finished enrollment of 3 major trials, proactive, pedal and motor. Our first paper from the proactive study has now been accepted, showing that Prospera can detect active rejection up to 4 months ahead of biopsy. No other cell free DNA lab has lead-time data like this and we think this data might support payer coverage in the surveillance setting. We look forward to this publication and we're already working on additional readouts from this study. Moving on to the pedal trial with over 500 patients enrolled from 28 different sites, this is an important prospective utility study aiming to show how Prospera can be used serially after a rejection event to predict therapeutic response and outcomes. We believe this study can bring significant value to the field for this important indication. Finally, the motor study is generating novel clinical validity data showing the performance of Prospera in cases of multi organ transplantation, including kidney heart, kidney pancreas and kidney liver. We expect these key trials to extend our data leadership in a meaningful way, so we're excited about 2024. Moving now to oncology. Signatera continues to benefit from a significant first mover advantage across multiple areas. The first is our significant leadership in technology and innovation, as exemplified by our strong IP portfolio and two recent favorable injunction decisions. We continue to invest in new innovation projects with multiple MRD related products that we plan to launch in 2024 and 2025. We also continue to invest in expanding our market leading clinical portfolio. Now with 70 peer reviewed oncology publications to date and multiple prospective randomized trials ongoing, many of which were designed several years ago, we believe this pipeline will continue generating data over the coming years that can become practice changing. In market access and reimbursement, today Signatera test is covered by Medicare and a growing number of private payers in colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer and pan cancer eye immunotherapy monitoring. We have now added ovarian cancer to that list, which Alex will cover in greater detail in a moment. This broad coverage allows oncologists to use Signatera across the majority of their patients. Finally, I want to highlight the operational capabilities that we've developed over nearly half a decade of experience. I believe many in the field discount the complexity of delivering tumor informed and personalized MRD results back to physicians and patients in a timely manner and at scale. There is a real experience curve here, which is not easy to replicate. We continue to expand and refine these capabilities through improvements to the turnaround time, expansion of our mobile phlebotomy services, integration into electronic medical records, and the launch of industry leading digital solutions for patients and physicians. Now, I want to hand the call over to Alex to cover recent clinical updates. Alex?\nAlexey Aleshin: Great. Thanks, Solomon. Turning now to key indications. In colorectal cancer, there are multiple events worth noting. We reported the first data from our BESPOKE-CRC registry study, which enrolled patients across more than 100 centers in the United States. The study's initial results were presented at ASCO GI this year and showed exceptional asset performance consistent with prior readouts. Additionally, for the first time, it was shown that Signatera testing markedly reduced patient anxiety and over 73% of respondents. Additionally, 96% of participants reported that they wanted to continue using Signatera going forward. The next study I wanted to highlight is the INTERCEPT trial that was done by MD Anderson Cancer Center with over 1,100 patients tested using commercial Signatera. The observational component of this study was able to characterize the impact of Signatera testing on a routine clinical practice and showed a median DFS of approximately 5.6 months between Signatera positivity and clinical relapse. Interestingly, the investigators also presented preliminary results from the Phase II TAS-102 substudy, which enrolled 13 patients to receive TAS-102 based on a positive Signatera result. Despite the small sample size, the study is notable since TAS-102 is the same drug being used in the randomized perspective ALTAIR study. The exciting finding was that 54% of patients had CK clearance at 3 months, suggesting high single agent activity of TAS-102 in this patient population. Compared to an untreated Signatera positive population, where our data suggests has spontaneous clearance freight should be around 3% to 4%. Additionally, this study reported a median disease-free survival of 9 to 4 months, which compares favorably to the 5.6 months I presented a moment ago from the broader observational cohort. Though we know the study was not randomized. We believe this all provides a positive signal for the ALTAIR study. We expect the top line readout from the ALTAIR trial in Q3 of this year with full results being presented and perhaps concomitantly published in Q4. If the study is positive, we expect it to be practice changing in the U.S., in Japan and likely, many other countries. Next, let us review our progress towards key catalysts in bladder cancer. Just to remind everyone, we currently have Medicare reimbursement, both in the neoadjuvant and recurrent sponsoring settings. While we do not talk about bladder cancer often with around 35,000 new patients being diagnosed every year, we believe this indication could become highly penetrated and well reimbursed pending the readout of the 2 studies highlighted on this slide. We have previously discussed the randomized, placebo-controlled global IMvigor011 study that is being done in collaboration with Genentech. The study continues to enroll well, and if the readout is positive, it would form the basis for our first Signatera FDA submission, likely in the second half of 2025. We believe the advanced status of our work with the FDA gives us an advantage. We also want to find that the prospective nonrandomized DFS data from the Signatera negative arm of this study will be presented in oral format at the European Association of Urology Conference later this year, and it may create an interim commercial tailwind is it shows convincing data that Signatera negative patients have good outcomes, especially if an improvement is noted beyond the great results we already saw in the IMvigor010 data set published in 2021. We are also pleased to announce the MODERN study being done in collaboration with the NCI funded Alliance Group. The lead PI of the study is Dr. Matthew Golsky, a leading expert in this space, and the study design is a testament to his and Alliance's leadership and forward thinking. With the study incorporating both an escalation and a de-escalation cohort, similar to design of the CIRCULATE trial in colorectal cancer. The de-escalation cohort has multiple similarities to the VEGA study and if it meets its primary end point, could have significant implications for patient management, making it possible to reduce unnecessary and expensive treatment in the MRD-negative patient population. Moving on to the next slide. We were excited this week to announce expansion of Medicare's coverage of Signatera to include ovarian cancer as well as the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer. Ovarian cancer affects close to 20,000 women per year in the United States has a median age of diagnosis of 63 years and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. Current tools, including imaging and biomarkers such as CA-125, are inadequate to guide adjuvant and surveillance decisions in Stage 2 to 4 disease. Based on the tariffs perspective, multicenter study evaluating 69 patients across over 160 time points, we reported longitudinal sensitivity and specificity of 100% to detect recurrence with an average lead time of around 10 months. In breast cancer, as a reminder, Signatera has already been reimbursed in the postoperative setting for Stage IIb and higher patients regardless of disease subtype. What's interesting is that up to 50% of all resectable Stage 2 to 4 breast cancer patients currently receive neoadjuvant therapy, which is any treatment prior to surgery, both to improve surgical outcomes and to assess the tumor sensitivity to systemic therapy. However, as the NCCN guidelines themselves now, current tools available for assessing new adjuvant treatment response are not perfect. Signatera has been extensively validated in this setting, particularly through our collaboration with ISPY-2 consortium, which is a leading group we have now been working with for over half a decade to study how bespoke CTA dynamics in the neoadjuvant setting can further improve on existing methods. In a study of over 280 patients and over 1,000 time points, we have shown that early Signatera clearance was highly predictive of therapy response, and persistent ctDNA detection was associated with 4 surgical response as well as a very poor distant relapse-free survival. We believe this expanded coverage can help inform care for tens of thousands of patients every single year. These coverage determinations are a great way to start the year. Especially as biomarker legislation kicks in across multiple states. We look forward to additional indications from MolDX in 2024 based on our published clinical data. Now, let me hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Great. Thanks, Alex. The first slide here is just a summary of our Q4 results compared to Q4 last year. Steve hit some of the highlights already. Revenues were up 43% and gross margins expanded by almost 10 full percentage points. On revenues, we estimate that we had roughly $5 million in true-up beyond what we typically get in a quarter that contributed to the $311 million in total revenues. So I would estimate the organic revenue number to be roughly $306 million. Steve also mentioned some lab-related savings that helped gross margins in the quarter. The way the holiday landed this year with the entire last week of December bracketed by Christmas and New Year's meant that we have fewer cases coming in from customers that last week of the quarter. And so didn't experience a typical COGS-related expenditures, we would normally expect in a week. It takes about a week for us to report out most of our tests so this resulted in slightly lower COGS expenses, but did not significantly impact revenue, which is only accrued on reported units. Netting all of that benefit out from our Q4 gross margin of 51.4% gives you our estimate of roughly 49% repeatable gross margins, which, of course, still represents a huge sequential step-up from Q3 of '23. We were able to drive these results on operating expenses that were stable compared to 2022. As Steve described, we've invested heavily to build the critical infrastructure needed to rapidly scale the business, and we believe we're in a position to drive significant future innovation with relatively modest increases in operating expenses from our current levels. This combination of expanding revenues and improving margins on stable expenses fits precisely with the multiyear strategy we've laid out in the past. The net result of that is that we cut our Q4 loss per share by more than half compared to Q4 2022, and now have clear line of sight to a cash flow breakeven quarter as Steve described. Okay. That's a good segue to the guidance on the next slide. We're excited to be initiating the revenue guide at $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion, gross margins at 50% to 53%. And with relatively stable operating expenses leading to another dramatic reduction in our cash burn. While there are a lot of variables that will cause cash flow to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we now believe we can get to a cash flow breakeven quarter by Q3, if not sooner. This cashes in a steady continuation of the strong underlying trends in volumes, ASPs and COGS we've seen over the past year but does not rely on upside drivers from potential guideline changes, any spike in volumes from further Signatera data or any meaningful benefit from the biomarker legislation in the calendar year. And it's just a modest contribution from the recent MoIDX coverage decisions. That approach leads to a fairly cautious guide on further margin expansion. I would expect to start the year in the high 40s, consistent with our organic estimate for Q4, with the goal of getting gross margins to the top end of the range and possibly beyond that by Q4 of 2024. We have also assumed a relatively modest volume contribution from Invitae accounts. We are picking up now, consistent with Steve's base case described earlier, but hope to be raising that forecast as we get more clarity on account retention in the coming months. In our R&D organization, the team has a steady drumbeat of product launches, clinical trial work, and COGS initiatives slated to launch this year. Once those initiatives are complete, we anticipate having bandwidth to keep driving innovation in future years without large increases in spending. The SG&A guide includes the pickup of the Invitae sales reps and several other product launch initiatives we have slated for this year. So at the midpoint of the guide, we are forecasting revenue growth well above 20%, about 650 basis points expansion in the gross margin against annual 2023 full year actual margins and operating expense growth of about 4%. Those of you that have followed us for a few years know that we prefer to start the year with a guide that feels challenging but achievable to us. And I think there are several sources of upside that could allow us to outperform once again this year. And that's another good segue to the next slide, which just summarizes those catalysts. We are making great progress on ASP's volume growth in COGS in our core business, as I just described. And I'm looking forward to sharing our progress on earnings calls this year as we continue to just execute on the initiatives within our control. If we can do that, I think we are in a position to outperform once again in 2024. Beyond that, we have some potentially significant catalysts on TAP. Of course, we have the potential guideline expansion in carrier screening in 22q that Steve described earlier in the call. The timing of those updates are always uncertain and subject to change. But tentatively, you could see some society guideline updates as early as this spring. In oncology, we are working to expand MolDx coverage to several additional tumor types and the advent of biomarker legislation in a number of heavily populated states creates an opportunity to drive commercial coverage higher for Signatera in those states. We are excited about the ALTAIR CRC escalation in treatment on molecular relapse study readout in colorectal cancer that Solomon touched on in his remarks, which we expect to get in the summer or early fall as he described. And finally, we are really excited about a number of significant product launches in women's health and oncology we have planned for this year. Consistent with our typical practice, we will dive into each of those product launches in the first earnings call post the launch. So in summary, I don't think we've ever been in a stronger position to start the year, and we are very pleased to be sharing these updates with you. So let me now hand the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Subbu Nambi with Guggenheim.\nSubbu Nambi: You guided to $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion in 2024 revenue. This is well above Street expectations. That said, as you noted on your last slide, there are still a lot of sources of upside. To unpack this a little bit, can you talk more about the key assumptions for things that are not in the guidance specifically, how are you thinking about the potential for videos, potential ASP increases for Signatera biomarker bill 22q, potentially Renasight. What I'm trying to get at is essentially the magnitude of upside for each of these in 2024? I can easily see our path to $50 million to $75 million in upside to your guide. When I look at these components, does that seem reasonable?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. This is Steve. So maybe I'll just make a couple of comments on these different things, and then Mike, you can sort of talk about the magnitude. I mean certainly, there's a lot of opportunities for upside. You've listed a couple of them. I think within Invitae, we're working hard to move as many of those accounts over as we can. And we think that is going well, as we said in the prepared remarks. We'll have a little more visibility as time goes on. From a guideline standpoint, all we can really do on guidelines is produce the peer-reviewed evidence. And we feel incredibly good about the evidence that's been produced particularly on 22q and on broad panel carrier screening. Now I think it's really up to the societies and the physicians to decide what they want to do. But certainly, that would provide a lot of upside as we're the market leader in noninvasive prenatal testing. We have a high attachment rate of microdeletion testing. And as we sit here, we believe we're the market leader as well in next-gen sequencing-based broad panel test. When you look at Signatera and ASP, certainly, there's a lot of opportunities for upside, the same with biomarker bills. So Mike, do you want to comment further?\nMichael Brophy: I mean I think those are the -- really the kind of the key drivers as you kind of think about kind of catalysts and beyond. I mean I would just reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, which are -- the underlying trends in the core business that we've been seeing the last couple of quarters have been quite strong. And if we can just continue to see those continue to hit our marks as best as we can think in a good position for '24.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: First of all, congrats on the quarter beyond the preannounced numbers and really great momentum you're seeing in the business. Maybe just wanted to follow up on the guide. Steve or Mike, maybe, can you elaborate a bit more just putting together the pieces here, I mean if I look at where you have guided to versus the consensus and our expectations. I mean, you're obviously increasing the ASP on the MRD side, you have recent indication expansion that you're seeing here. Obviously, there's momentum on Panorama, ASP on Panorama from last year, carrier screening. I mean, there's a list is fairly long. So -- and then we have Invitae's volumes adding on top of it. So maybe just walk me through sort of why this prudent guide still just given sort of the momentum you have? And also maybe if you can talk a little bit about the 22q microdeletion timing? I know you mentioned that briefly, but what else needs to happen there? And I have a follow-up.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. Yes. I mean, I think like -- so to me, I think that's good. That's a good summary of a lot of the drivers we have going forward on '24, as Steve covered on the prior question. And I would just go back to -- in each of these drivers, you're going to take like some judgment around setting the guide for the year. We want to set something that -- so clearly, as you referenced, requires really good execution. It's going to require good volume execution. It's going to require continued momentum in ASPs and COGS. We think we can deliver that. And it's just a matter of kind of setting the level of what's challenging but achievable for the beginning of the year guide. So really no change in philosophy from what you've seen from us in prior years. On the 22q front, I think really it's the same commentary that we provided previously. The SMART trial, as we covered in our prepared remarks, we really feel like is the landmark trial in the space. Those results were excellent. They've now had time to kind of get those data out and get it published. They've been presented at multiple conferences. I think you have got or publications have now come out of that study. And so we think that merits further guideline consideration. Of course, the guideline committees run their own show and we don't have perfect visibility into the timing of those things. And hence, you never include benefit from guideline inclusions in a guide to start the year, but we remain very optimistic about our prospects.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And then -- if I could cover on the MRD side. You had ovarian cancer and as well as new adjuvant breast cancer expansion. When do you think that starts to come in into the volumes -- just wanted to confirm they should also benefit from the ADLT rate that you have currently? And also maybe Alex can talk about it within the framework of the clinical trials that you have with ALTAIR and the new trial that you announced today, can you maybe just sort of stack them because there's -- this does look like a series of sort of data sets that enhance your position in the marketplace. But also maybe just how does all of this play into the NCCN guideline update when we do hear that? And if you have any updates on that front, that would be great as well.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So first, I'll just say on ovarian and neoadjuvant breast, we're really excited about those indications. We've got some great data and more data coming out. I think generally, once we get coverage in place, that's really when the medical liaison team and commercial team can start going out and educating physicians really about the benefit. So that will take a little bit of time to come in. But certainly, there's volume there today that will benefit from Alex, do you want to talk about ALTAIR and the potential there for upside opportunity and guidelines?\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes. Absolutely, Steve. Puneet, thanks for the question. I think as we presented in our prepared remarks, we're expecting a readout top line readout kind of in Q3 for the ALTAIR study. And we do believe that this study, if positive, maybe 1 of the largest events in how early-stage cancer is managed in quite a while. Just to put this in perspective, the last study that truly changed how early-stage colon cancer is managed was the MOSAIC study published in 2004. So I think there's a lot of pent-up interest in approving new treatment modalities for these patients. We believe that any positive statistically significant result will be significantly impactful for how patients are treated. And we're frequently asked like what are some of the numbers that would be even more significant. And I would kind of guide folks to look at the MOSAIC study, which showed hazard ratio of 0.77, and an absolute risk reduction of 5%. So we strongly feel that if we want or both of these metrics, the study would be even more significant. And then in terms of the IMvigor011 study, we're expecting top line readout for that in Q1 of 2025. And again, if that study is positive, we also believe that would significantly not just change the guidelines, but really fundamentally alter how early stage bladder cancer is managed. So I think these are the 2 most kind of immediate binary events to look forward to. And we have many other studies currently ongoing that we'll be reading out the next year or 2.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Westenberg with Piper Sander.\nDavid Westenberg: On extremely strong quarter. So I'm going to dig in to get to the guidance. I'm really happy with the guidance, but I do want to tell you the upside -- looking to the upside as well. So just in terms of the Invitae acquisition, I mean, I would assume your ASPs are higher than there is in a lot of the reproductive health areas. And you're calling for 25% or $25 million and I think $100 million business. So can you talk -- I mean, that would imply a little bit even less than maybe, say, 25%. So can you just make -- walk me through your 50% share kind of why you would anticipate just maybe that low of picking up of that share. And if it's share you don't really want I would assume other companies in the space would also not want it, and we maybe see a melt-up in pricing melt up in pricing in kind of those kind of accounts contemplated in the guide? And then finally, on that one, a lot of those OB sales force sell BRCA too. I know BRCA's not that big of a business for you, but is BRCA cross-selling also something to contemplate in that. So that was 1 question. One follow-up. It will be shorter.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. No, no, that makes sense, and that's a good question. So we said we're thinking somewhere in the sort of $20 million to $30 million range is a conservative number. But we also said that we think that can get up to $50 million to $60 million. So we really have to see how things come in as we look into this sort of post-acquisition window. A couple of things to note that I think are important. I think the first thing is that the volume that we started with at the end of January after the acquisition was, I think, a decent amount less than maybe where Invitae was in the last time they reported out their volume in Q3. And that makes sense because they had announced some initiatives to reduce some of their low-margin business. So for example, some of their low cash pay business. So I think the starting point for us is different maybe than what you're what your expectations were. Now with that said, we're working hard now to transition over as many of the accounts, which is generally the high-margin accounts because those were the ones that were remaining over to Natera. And we think we're doing really well. Generally, when you look at these things, you go back and you look at December 4, I know this is a little bit different than that situation. But Natera has generally done very, very well in these settings, retaining the vast majority of the business. Certainly, 50% plus of the business. And I think that's what we'll see here. And I guess last question -- sorry, I'm back, I forgot the answer. Do you think there's an opportunity there through the OB channel, and we think there's some opportunities there as well on the oncology side. So certainly, with the disruption happening, there will be some upside opportunity there.\nDavid Westenberg: I forgot I asked that part. So just in terms of expectation, you have neoadjuvant breast, adjuvant breast, bladder, CRC, IO. Can you talk about your expectation for long? And just given that you have all these tissue types, and I'm asking you to predict a bureaucratic agency, but have you had any conversations with MolDX or expectations on MolDX and just say, you know what, this science works in every tumor type. So when does that get coverage?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that's a good question. So I think this question of pan cancer is something that I think a lot of people have asked over time. And certainly, as you start to look at the long tail of cancers getting covered, I think at some point in the future, there may be an opportunity for just kind of across-the-board pan cancer coverage. But we haven't set up to be dependent on that. What we're doing is we're doing very thoughtful detailed clinical validations on all the different tumor types, and we're generating the data that's needed to obtain coverage. And we think that's, I think, 1 of the reasons why we're in a leadership position today is because we've done that hard work. We generated these studies. We spent now 5 or 6 years working on some of these trials and other companies, they may come in and not put that work in and then they end up not getting coverage. So we think we're a great opportunity. Obviously, there's more tumor types that are in submission. We're excited about ovarian in neoadjuvant breast, but you mentioned lung, you mentioned -- or I guess you didn't mention gastroesophageal, we think, is a big opportunity for us that fits nicely with the colorectal indication. So lots of upside. We're continuing to focus here and generate data.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Steve, Mike, I'll spare you the question why you've decided to be prudent with the guide and take a highly different tack here. What I want to know is what would carrier screening and ACOG guideline inclusion for 22q mean in terms of gross margin upside? I know it's not baked in, but were those 2 guidelines to fall in place in the spring? What does that look like? And Steve, on the exit of some of these lower margin Invitae accounts over the course of the year, is that something that we should be thinking about in terms of just the phasing of the gross margins through '24?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, it's a good question. So let me just comment on Invitae first. And so what I mentioned there is that Invitae themselves had actually taken steps, I believe, in Q3 time frame of last year to exit some of their lower margin accounts or maybe move away from some of that business. And so that's why the starting point of where we took over in January was maybe a little bit different than what you might have seen from Invitae in Q3. From the Natera side, when we bring this business on, it's obviously through the Natera contracts and insurance contracts and with the Natera products. And so we think the margin should be in line with what is currently now kind of an accelerating and expanding Natera gross margin. Hopefully, that makes sense. From the upside opportunity, obviously, there's an enormous amount of upside in the guidance. We didn't include anything for 22q coverage. We didn't include anything from broad panel carrier screening. So obviously, there's upside as these things come in. If you just think about the clinical impact and the data that we generated, we really think that, that's the most important piece. 22q is a very severe disorder. It's a leading cause of congenital heart defects causes\u2019 hypocalcemia, which can lead to seizures and brain damage at birth, if it's not treated. So this is a very serious disorder. We test for it with, I think, a very well-validated test that was prospectively done over a 7-year period. We think we've checked all the boxes for society guidelines. If you look at the very high attachment rate that we have, I think 75% plus of our in IPT, get 22q. Obviously, there's upside opportunity, but we think it's really important that patients get access to this test and then it's covered by their insurance company. The same thing for expanded panel carrier screening, as we said today, we believe we're the market leader in next-gen sequencing-based expanded panel testing. But there's still opportunity there as guidelines come in place both to extend the volume today. There are still customers and OB offices around the country that are ordering smaller panels. As the guidelines come in, we think that they will transition to broader panels, which will put Natera in a good position. And there's also a lot of business today that we're just not reimbursed on where the payers maybe have a negative coverage policy where there's an opportunity to get paid and get coverage for testing that the physicians want and that we think are important for patients.\nTejas Savant: And then switching gears to oncology, Steve. Just curious as to what's your thought process in terms of time lines to reimbursement in the breast recurrence monitoring indication? I mean that's clearly the big price. Second, can you comment on the FoundationOne tracker I mean given the broader launch in Medicare coverage here? Where you expect in terms of perhaps an attach rate by year-end '24? And then finally, the data on early detection, I believe the first readout there is relatively imminent. But just curious as to how you're sort of perhaps you've updated your thought process there in terms of the go/no-go decision in terms of the performance specs you'd like to see from that data that would be helpful.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So maybe I'll comment quickly on early cancer detection and then hand it over to Solomon to talk about breast cancer recurrence monitoring and some of the exciting data potentially coming around treatment on molecular recurrence. So on early cancer detection, we are planning probably in Q2 to read out a case-control study that's going to include both colorectal and advanced adenoma patients. And we're excited about that readout. The vast majority of those samples were prospectively collected and matched with colonoscopy. Not all of them, but the vast majority were. So then after that, depending -- we're going to take a look at how that data looks. Obviously, we're excited about it. After that, in October time frame, maybe sometime September, October, we're going to be reading out roughly a 1,000-patient prospective study that will be 100% colonoscopy match. That's already recruiting patients today. And then depending on the readout of there, we'll make a decision about what we do going forward as far as the FDA enabling trial. But the way that we've set this up is that the 1,000-patient study that's going to read out in Q3, that's actually the exact same protocol that would be used for the FDA enabling trial. So if we do want to go ahead with the FDA, we just continue enrolling into that study. So it's not like there's going to be a delay about the trial. Now as we said before, the decision for us is going to depend on what the performance of the test looks like. And everything that we're doing this year is included in our budget. It's not any additional cost. We said we're moving rapidly to cash flow breakeven. We're going to hit that in Q3 or sooner. So all of the expenses on early cancer detection will be included in that. We'll still be getting the cash flow breakeven the same schedule. If we do decide to move forward and view an FDA-enabling trial, that would be based on us seeing market-leading performance. And that needs to be, I think, better than anything else out there from a blood standpoint for both colorectal and advanced adenoma. So Solomon, do you want to talk about breast cancer?\nSolomon Moshkevich : Sure. I think the question was specifically about coverage in breast cancer recurrence monitoring. And we do have that already. Signatera was covered for recurrence monitoring in all subtypes of breast cancer, that decision came out early last year. That's been a very high demand area for Signatera. So as a reminder, almost 300,000 new breast cancer diagnoses per year in the U.S. We estimate over 100,000 of those are eligible under the Medicare coverage, which is Stage 2b and above, and that's for both adjuvant decision-making and recurrence monitoring. And then for many of those patients, especially in the hormone receptor positive disease, recurrence monitoring is something people do not just for a few years after surgery, but 5 to 10 Years after surgery. So that's a very important area for us to be helping our patients and we've been doing that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Schenkel: First, let me just start with the, I guess, a clarification on ALTAIR. In terms of defining success in getting NCCN guideline inclusion and driving broader commercial reimbursement. If you get 5 to 9 months of disease-free survival, is that enough? Is that a win? I picked this range because I think that's the range of DFS demonstrated in the 2 INTERCEPT sub-studies. So as we think about the readout the summer, is that kind of the goalpost that we should be setting?\nSteve Chapman: Alex, why don't you take that?\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes, absolutely. So I would think instead of the hazard ratio for DSS. And if the MOSAIC study is any comparator, the hazard ratio there was 0.77. And then the second thing that's usually pretty important is the absolute risk reduction. So what percentage of patients do you prevent from recurring with a new therapy? And for that study, I think the event rate went down from 26.1% to something like 21.1% with addition of oxaliplatin. So I would use those 2 as benchmarks. I think the median DSS improvement in absolute terms, that may be a little bit difficult, and I would not extrapolate those numbers from INTERCEPT to ALTAIR. Instead, I would focus on the hazard ratio as well as the absolute risk reduction.\nDoug Schenkel: The next topic I wanted to touch on is MRD competition. So you guys have had a tremendous amount of success awarding competition, defending your intellectual property estate. There's been a ton of focus out there on how this landscape is going to evolve even with wins by Natera. There's a potential bevy of companies intending to launch new products over the next couple of years. So 2 questions. One, can you talk about what you expect in terms of stickiness associated with existing accounts and really a material first mover advantage that you have? And what can be gleaned from your experience in NIPT, which is a -- it's a competitive market where you have what I think is a very fair to say, sticky. I mean how much money would you need to invest to catch up with Natera, a company that's still doing more studies including one that you announced for the first time today.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that's a great question. I'll make a couple of comments and then maybe, Solomon, you can talk a little bit more about all the things that we've done as we look toward the future. First, I'll say there is competition. We think the tumor-informed MRD companies are the real competitors here. And particularly, I think NeoGenomics is a strong competitor. Of course, they've been in joint right now, but they have a very strong footprint. And although I think when you look at the performance of the NeoGenomics product, from an analytical standpoint, they've made some very significant claims. But if you dig into the details, they've really increased the amount of plasma input to make it seem like the test analytically performs potentially better than it does. And I think that hurts us when you look at comparative claims that they're making based on different levels of plasma input. Now when you look at the clinical validation, what we see on the radar product, is that the performance doesn't really hold up. And we see this where analytical validation or maybe looks good, but then you look at the clinical validation and it doesn't quite look as good. So you just have to be careful of that with any competitors that are making claims about the performance of their tests. Solomon, do you want to talk about some of the stuff that we've done? I think the investments that we've made into clinical data and clinical trials?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. I spoke about this in the prepared remarks as well. I would say that 1 of the most fundamental pieces here is that once a Signatera patient always a Signatera patient. So once you've got a personalized assay designed for a particular patient, it's extremely unlikely that they would go design a new personalized assay with some other lab. And there's ripple effects to that, right? So that means a physician's office that's testing a bunch of Signatera patients quarterly or every 6 months, that creates its own level of switching costs for that practice to bring on another lab. Now that being said, that we are not resting on our heels from that perspective. It's always been a part of Natera's core recipe to be on the cutting edge with test performance and to continue pushing the boundaries with clinical validity and utility. And I think that's where you see us continuing to invest following that strategy. So as I -- as we pointed out on the call, we're planning to put out multiple new features and enhancements in MRD-related products over the next 12 to 24 months. And we've got a ton of investment in clinical trials. So I don't think I can give you a specific number that you asked for, how many hundreds of millions of dollars would you need to be able to catch up. But it's definitely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\nSteve Chapman: And Doug, maybe I'll just add to that a little bit. I mean if you look at the different areas Solomon broke out, you look at data, I mean we now have a significant number of peer-reviewed studies that have been published. But not only that, we have multiple randomized trials that are ongoing that have been underway, some now for kind of 5 years or something in that time frame. And I think the key thing is with these randomized trials that the data really is only applicable to the test that was used in the trial. So I think we're seeing some groups now are coming, doing clinical validations where they're looking just at the performance of their test. And as you go forward, that's really not going to be good enough. You have to have a randomized study that shows how patient outcomes were impacted based on using your test in the randomized study. And that's where we're going to be and that's where we think things are going as we move forward and moving away from analytical validations and from clinical validation.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Congrats on the quarter and the year last year. Maybe just given the importance of the gross profit line, could you maybe just talk about your expectations for ASP trends for women's health kind of ex-potential guideline inclusion? Like what do you kind of envision in terms of ASPs for this year? And then I have 1 quick follow-up.\nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. Yes, Matt. Yes. I mean I think we expect to see stable trends in the in the women's health ASPs that we saw toward the end of last year. So as folks have followed for some time will recall when we saw really strong kind of sequential movements upward in the ASP particularly for carrier screening, but also for the NIPT product through the course of the year, and that was a big driver, along with obviously, Natera ASPs of the margin expansion you saw in the calendar year '23 results. And now, in '24, what the guidance was is that you get the full year benefit of the ASPs that we saw in Q4. So that -- obviously, that does leave room for there to be continued improvement, and we're working every day to continue to -- 2, we can't operate to make sure that we get the reimbursement for the covered services that we think we deserve. So there's room for that to continue to improve above the expectations we've set this year. I think that's a good kind of starting point for the guidance.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. And then just on Mike, again, just on COGS reduction, and you guys have done a good job. It's obviously been a key gross margin driver. As you kind of look across your businesses, where do you see the most upside for reduction in COGS whether it's in women's health, Signatera, organ health, et cetera? Like where do you think the biggest levers are for COGS reduction this year that could actually drive those gross margins to the top end of the guide like you talked about?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. I mean I think the first -- yes, the first project that comes to mind there, obviously, is the in-house project for Signatera exome in Austin. So as a reminder, we launched our exome capability in San Carlos last year, we've driven a significant portion of the volumes to the in-house exome. And then launching in Austin unlocks another wave of cost efficiencies just because you've got more space, you can deploy more automation, so on and so forth in that Austin lab. So we're very excited about that. We'd like to have that launched in the summer or early fall. In addition to that, though, I mean, I think we've got across each of the major products, I mean, Panorama, carrier screening and Signatera, we've got workflow launches and improvements coming this year that can drive COGS lower across the business. And those COGS projects because, Matt, like as you mentioned, like we have a long track record of putting those COGS projects on the board, scheduling them, investing in them and then hitting our marks in terms of actually yielding the savings. Those COGS projects are in the guide. So there's not a lot of hedge in the guide for those. But again, we're excited to deploy those, and we think they can help us mature.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks Steve. Let's start with the Invitae deal. First, recall we secured a judgment on past damages in our Archer IP litigation of roughly $20 million. We anticipated that it could be difficult to collect that amount from Invitae given their financial issues. So we applied that judgment amount as part of the consideration in this deal. We also paid Invitae $10 million upfront and if we have excellent retention of Invitae's accounts, there's a potential milestone payment that we can make of up to $22.5 million. We would be very happy to make that payment because it would mean that the deal is working extremely well for us. As a reminder, we did not take on any of Invitae's products, its lab operations, nor its physical assets. We did hire roughly 30 of their women's health sales reps and our goal is to provide a seamless transition of those Invitae accounts to Natera's Panorama and Horizon products. Our team is working hard to retain as much volume as we can and we're doing well. We expect to retain at least $20 million to $25 million in high quality recurring revenue per year, but we think there is a potential to increase that up to $50 million to $60 million depending on how things go, especially if we see clinical practice guidelines for expanded carrier screening or 22q, which we think could come as soon as this spring and would provide upside to these numbers. So we think the deal rationale is strong and we look forward to providing more updates as the year progresses. One of the keys to our offering in women's health is our highly differentiated screening test for the 22q microdeletion. As 22q goes into societal guidelines and becomes commonplace as we believe it will, the differentiation that Natera has in its 22q test is going to become increasingly valuable. When we run our test, we're using our core SNP-based technology that allows us to target this very small region of the genome, which is around 2.5 to 3 megabases. This allows us to get over 25x more observations in this particular region of interest than companies doing massively parallel shotgun sequencing, which creates a significant technical advantage that has translated into excellent clinical performance as demonstrated in the SMART trial. We think the SMART trial represents the gold standard in clinical validation that would be very hard to repeat. As a reminder, SMART was a 7-year multicenter prospective trial that enrolled more than 20,000 patients and collected genetic outcomes from prenatal specimens and newborn blood spots. In this trial, Panorama demonstrated overall clinical sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 99.95%, which translates to PPV of 52.6% overall and a PPV of 100% in cases with ultrasound anomalies. As 22q has gotten more attention in the wake of a strong guideline from ACMG and anticipated guidelines from ACOG, we have noticed competitors starting to present datasets with PPV metrics that look high, but with screen positive rates that are low or completely unreported. In one report from a lab doing shotgun sequencing, the screen positive rate was approximately 1 in 6,500, which is 3 or 4 times lower than the expected population incidence, suggesting that they might be missing a significant number of affected pregnancies. In addition, other labs are making comparative claims based on patient cohorts that had very high rates of ultrasound findings, where we saw PPV of 100% in the SMART trial, as I mentioned previously. In our view, a test is not appropriate for population screening if you don't know the clinical sensitivity and [indiscernible]. These are typical marketing tactics that we've seen before and we do think physicians will see through it. Moving now into carrier screening, we've seen really strong adoption in the past year and we believe we're the number one ordered next gen sequencing based carrier screening test in the United States. Our mix of broader panels increased after the exit of 704 from the market in late 2022. And we are finding that quite a few of the new transitioning Invitae accounts also have a strong mix of broad panels. So in addition to our existing portfolio, we are really pleased to be launching a new 613 gene panel and a totally flexible custom panel option to serve these customers. Horizon provides high detection across all genes, including the challenging ones where other labs may struggle. With these new panels together with our investments in variant curation, our genetic counselor team and lab automation, we think Horizon is well positioned to remain a leader in the field. Broad panel carrier screening is also a hot topic for ACOG, where we expect to see an expanded guideline in 2024. Turning now to organ health, where we are excited about the prospects for 2024 and beyond. We think the strength of our clinical data, our commercial execution and our intellectual property estate enables us to compete for the leadership position in this space. Our clinical data generation in organ health has been prodigious in the last 5 years, where we now have 39 papers published or accepted in top journals. In the heart indication, we recently had our third paper accepted for publication, the Trifecta Heart Study, which demonstrated strong correlation between Prospera and endomyocardial biopsy assessed with the molecular microscope. Reporting an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. You can see in these 3 high quality data sets on the page the consistent performance across the Trifecta, DTRT and DEDUCE trials, including in adults and pediatrics. This performance laid the foundation for us to start the randomized controlled ACES trial, which aims to show the non-inferiority of using surveillance with Prospera compared to surveillance biopsies that most centers do on a monthly basis in the first year after a heart transplant. Sites are preparing for their first enrollment this summer. Now in the kidney transplant space, we have finished enrollment of 3 major trials, proactive, pedal and motor. Our first paper from the proactive study has now been accepted, showing that Prospera can detect active rejection up to 4 months ahead of biopsy. No other cell free DNA lab has lead-time data like this and we think this data might support payer coverage in the surveillance setting. We look forward to this publication and we're already working on additional readouts from this study. Moving on to the pedal trial with over 500 patients enrolled from 28 different sites, this is an important prospective utility study aiming to show how Prospera can be used serially after a rejection event to predict therapeutic response and outcomes. We believe this study can bring significant value to the field for this important indication. Finally, the motor study is generating novel clinical validity data showing the performance of Prospera in cases of multi organ transplantation, including kidney heart, kidney pancreas and kidney liver. We expect these key trials to extend our data leadership in a meaningful way, so we're excited about 2024. Moving now to oncology. Signatera continues to benefit from a significant first mover advantage across multiple areas. The first is our significant leadership in technology and innovation, as exemplified by our strong IP portfolio and two recent favorable injunction decisions. We continue to invest in new innovation projects with multiple MRD related products that we plan to launch in 2024 and 2025. We also continue to invest in expanding our market leading clinical portfolio. Now with 70 peer reviewed oncology publications to date and multiple prospective randomized trials ongoing, many of which were designed several years ago, we believe this pipeline will continue generating data over the coming years that can become practice changing. In market access and reimbursement, today Signatera test is covered by Medicare and a growing number of private payers in colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer and pan cancer eye immunotherapy monitoring. We have now added ovarian cancer to that list, which Alex will cover in greater detail in a moment. This broad coverage allows oncologists to use Signatera across the majority of their patients. Finally, I want to highlight the operational capabilities that we've developed over nearly half a decade of experience. I believe many in the field discount the complexity of delivering tumor informed and personalized MRD results back to physicians and patients in a timely manner and at scale. There is a real experience curve here, which is not easy to replicate. We continue to expand and refine these capabilities through improvements to the turnaround time, expansion of our mobile phlebotomy services, integration into electronic medical records, and the launch of industry leading digital solutions for patients and physicians. Now, I want to hand the call over to Alex to cover recent clinical updates. Alex? Sure. I think the question was specifically about coverage in breast cancer recurrence monitoring. And we do have that already. Signatera was covered for recurrence monitoring in all subtypes of breast cancer, that decision came out early last year. That's been a very high demand area for Signatera. So as a reminder, almost 300,000 new breast cancer diagnoses per year in the U.S. We estimate over 100,000 of those are eligible under the Medicare coverage, which is Stage 2b and above, and that's for both adjuvant decision-making and recurrence monitoring. And then for many of those patients, especially in the hormone receptor positive disease, recurrence monitoring is something people do not just for a few years after surgery, but 5 to 10 Years after surgery. So that's a very important area for us to be helping our patients and we've been doing that. Sure. I spoke about this in the prepared remarks as well. I would say that 1 of the most fundamental pieces here is that once a Signatera patient always a Signatera patient. So once you've got a personalized assay designed for a particular patient, it's extremely unlikely that they would go design a new personalized assay with some other lab.

And we've got a ton of investment in clinical trials. So I don't think I can give you a specific number that you asked for, how many hundreds of millions of dollars would you need to be able to catch up. But it's definitely in the hundreds of millions of dollars."

            "name": "Alexey Aleshin",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Solomon. Turning now to key indications. In colorectal cancer, there are multiple events worth noting. We reported the first data from our BESPOKE-CRC registry study, which enrolled patients across more than 100 centers in the United States. The study's initial results were presented at ASCO GI this year and showed exceptional asset performance consistent with prior readouts. Additionally, for the first time, it was shown that Signatera testing markedly reduced patient anxiety and over 73% of respondents. Additionally, 96% of participants reported that they wanted to continue using Signatera going forward. The next study I wanted to highlight is the INTERCEPT trial that was done by MD Anderson Cancer Center with over 1,100 patients tested using commercial Signatera. The observational component of this study was able to characterize the impact of Signatera testing on a routine clinical practice and showed a median DFS of approximately 5.6 months between Signatera positivity and clinical relapse. Interestingly, the investigators also presented preliminary results from the Phase II TAS-102 substudy, which enrolled 13 patients to receive TAS-102 based on a positive Signatera result. Despite the small sample size, the study is notable since TAS-102 is the same drug being used in the randomized perspective ALTAIR study. The exciting finding was that 54% of patients had CK clearance at 3 months, suggesting high single agent activity of TAS-102 in this patient population. Compared to an untreated Signatera positive population, where our data suggests has spontaneous clearance freight should be around 3% to 4%. Additionally, this study reported a median disease-free survival of 9 to 4 months, which compares favorably to the 5.6 months I presented a moment ago from the broader observational cohort. Though we know the study was not randomized. We believe this all provides a positive signal for the ALTAIR study. We expect the top line readout from the ALTAIR trial in Q3 of this year with full results being presented and perhaps concomitantly published in Q4. If the study is positive, we expect it to be practice changing in the U.S., in Japan and likely, many other countries. Next, let us review our progress towards key catalysts in bladder cancer. Just to remind everyone, we currently have Medicare reimbursement, both in the neoadjuvant and recurrent sponsoring settings. While we do not talk about bladder cancer often with around 35,000 new patients being diagnosed every year, we believe this indication could become highly penetrated and well reimbursed pending the readout of the 2 studies highlighted on this slide. We have previously discussed the randomized, placebo-controlled global IMvigor011 study that is being done in collaboration with Genentech. The study continues to enroll well, and if the readout is positive, it would form the basis for our first Signatera FDA submission, likely in the second half of 2025. We believe the advanced status of our work with the FDA gives us an advantage. We also want to find that the prospective nonrandomized DFS data from the Signatera negative arm of this study will be presented in oral format at the European Association of Urology Conference later this year, and it may create an interim commercial tailwind is it shows convincing data that Signatera negative patients have good outcomes, especially if an improvement is noted beyond the great results we already saw in the IMvigor010 data set published in 2021. We are also pleased to announce the MODERN study being done in collaboration with the NCI funded Alliance Group. The lead PI of the study is Dr. Matthew Golsky, a leading expert in this space, and the study design is a testament to his and Alliance's leadership and forward thinking. With the study incorporating both an escalation and a de-escalation cohort, similar to design of the CIRCULATE trial in colorectal cancer. The de-escalation cohort has multiple similarities to the VEGA study and if it meets its primary end point, could have significant implications for patient management, making it possible to reduce unnecessary and expensive treatment in the MRD-negative patient population. Moving on to the next slide. We were excited this week to announce expansion of Medicare's coverage of Signatera to include ovarian cancer as well as the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer. Ovarian cancer affects close to 20,000 women per year in the United States has a median age of diagnosis of 63 years and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. Current tools, including imaging and biomarkers such as CA-125, are inadequate to guide adjuvant and surveillance decisions in Stage 2 to 4 disease. Based on the tariffs perspective, multicenter study evaluating 69 patients across over 160 time points, we reported longitudinal sensitivity and specificity of 100% to detect recurrence with an average lead time of around 10 months. In breast cancer, as a reminder, Signatera has already been reimbursed in the postoperative setting for Stage IIb and higher patients regardless of disease subtype. What's interesting is that up to 50% of all resectable Stage 2 to 4 breast cancer patients currently receive neoadjuvant therapy, which is any treatment prior to surgery, both to improve surgical outcomes and to assess the tumor sensitivity to systemic therapy. However, as the NCCN guidelines themselves now, current tools available for assessing new adjuvant treatment response are not perfect. Signatera has been extensively validated in this setting, particularly through our collaboration with ISPY-2 consortium, which is a leading group we have now been working with for over half a decade to study how bespoke CTA dynamics in the neoadjuvant setting can further improve on existing methods. In a study of over 280 patients and over 1,000 time points, we have shown that early Signatera clearance was highly predictive of therapy response, and persistent ctDNA detection was associated with 4 surgical response as well as a very poor distant relapse-free survival. We believe this expanded coverage can help inform care for tens of thousands of patients every single year. These coverage determinations are a great way to start the year. Especially as biomarker legislation kicks in across multiple states. We look forward to additional indications from MolDX in 2024 based on our published clinical data. Now, let me hand the call over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Yes. Absolutely, Steve. Puneet, thanks for the question. I think as we presented in our prepared remarks, we're expecting a readout top line readout kind of in Q3 for the ALTAIR study. And we do believe that this study, if positive, maybe 1 of the largest events in how early-stage cancer is managed in quite a while. Just to put this in perspective, the last study that truly changed how early-stage colon cancer is managed was the MOSAIC study published in 2004. So I think there's a lot of pent-up interest in approving new treatment modalities for these patients. We believe that any positive statistically significant result will be significantly impactful for how patients are treated. And we're frequently asked like what are some of the numbers that would be even more significant. And I would kind of guide folks to look at the MOSAIC study, which showed hazard ratio of 0.77, and an absolute risk reduction of 5%. So we strongly feel that if we want or both of these metrics, the study would be even more significant. And then in terms of the IMvigor011 study, we're expecting top line readout for that in Q1 of 2025. And again, if that study is positive, we also believe that would significantly not just change the guidelines, but really fundamentally alter how early stage bladder cancer is managed. So I think these are the 2 most kind of immediate binary events to look forward to. And we have many other studies currently ongoing that we'll be reading out the next year or 2. Yes, absolutely. So I would think instead of the hazard ratio for DSS. And if the MOSAIC study is any comparator, the hazard ratio there was 0.77. And then the second thing that's usually pretty important is the absolute risk reduction. So what percentage of patients do you prevent from recurring with a new therapy? And for that study, I think the event rate went down from 26.1% to something like 21.1% with addition of oxaliplatin. So I would use those 2 as benchmarks. I think the median DSS improvement in absolute terms, that may be a little bit difficult, and I would not extrapolate those numbers from INTERCEPT to ALTAIR. Instead, I would focus on the hazard ratio as well as the absolute risk reduction."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Natera is focused on transforming the diagnosis and management of disease worldwide. Our growth is driven by combining our innovative technology with significant peer reviewed clinical evidence that supports the utility of our products. We've had a lot of great news since our presentation at the JPMorgan conference and we're excited to get into the highlights. We finished Q4 with $311 million of revenue, which was $11 million ahead of the preannouncement we made in January and represents 43% growth over Q4 of 2022. Full year revenues were $1.080 billion an increase of more than 30% compared to 2022. On volumes, we processed 2,496,000 tests in 2023, which is roughly 6,000 units ahead of the preannouncement. We processed 341,000 oncology tests in 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 73.5% and we also saw strong growth metrics in women's health and organ health. Gross margins in Q4 came in at 51.4%, compared to our Q1 margin of 39.9%. We finished the full year at 45.5% above the top end of the Q3 guide. As Mike will cover later in the call, we had some revenue true ups and lab savings in Q4 that don't repeat every quarter. We estimate organic revenues in Q4 were roughly $306 million and gross margins were roughly 49%, which still represents a significant improvement versus previous quarters. And as we discussed at the JPMorgan conference, we also made great progress on cash burn throughout the course of the year, ultimately reducing our cash burn by roughly $193 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The guidance for 2024 reflects the continued momentum in the business that generated these very strong results in 2023. We are guiding revenues of $1.320 billion to $1.350 billion gross margins of 50% to 53% and cash burn for the full year of $50 million to $75 million. On cash, we estimate we will be cash flow breakeven by Q3 or sooner. What's most impressive is we will be achieving this cash flow breakeven quarter while still making very significant investments into our core business. You'll see later in the guidance that our investment in research and development and commercial operations remains robust in 2024. This includes major investments in core product enhancements and line extensions, plus potentially guideline enabling clinical trials that we believe could benefit patients in the years to come. We can do this because our core fundamentals are so strong. We're in large expanding markets, our volume is growing rapidly and our margin is expanding with ASP increasing and COGS going down. I'll now hit a few other highlights before we go into more details on each. First, we think our recent acquisition of Invitae's women's health assets is well timed given the clinical value of expanded carrier screening and the strong trends we are seeing there and we're feeling positive about our progress on the acquisition thus far. In organ health, we're building momentum as we complete enrollment and readout major innovative clinical trials. We'll be talking today about some big first of their kind perspective studies in donor derived cell free DNA and how they may positively impact patient care. Finally, in oncology, earlier this week, we were pleased to announce that the MolDX has expanded coverage for Signatera to neoadjuvant monitoring in breast cancer and separately for MRD and recurrence monitoring in ovarian cancer. We've had a drumbeat of exciting clinical developments across a range of indications including CRC, muscle invasive bladder cancer and breast cancer. I'm excited for Alex to also talk about the modern study in bladder cancer, which just enrolled its first patient a few weeks ago. Finally, we've had a string of good results on the IP front that I think puts us in an excellent position in 2024 and beyond. Okay, great. Let's get into details of the results on the next slide. Revenues exceeded our expectations at $311 million driven by continued strong volume growth and excellent ASP traction across the business, particularly in women's health and oncology. We previously had a goal to get oncology ASPs above $1,000 by the end of 2024 and we actually hit that level in Q4 of 2023. That's great news because we now think we can get a full year's benefit of higher ASPs in 2024 and we think there's still room to drive Signatera clinical ASPs another $50 to $75 higher just by continuing to execute on currently covered indications. Of course, this week's announcement on new Medicare coverage will help us as well. The commentary on women's health ASPs is broadly similar. We saw encouraging sequential quarterly progress throughout the course of 2023 and preliminary analysis of Q1 trends suggest that we are on track for continued improvement so far in 2024. Volume was a strong driver of Q4 performance as well and you can see the annual volume trend on the next slide. As mentioned earlier, we came in 61,000 units ahead of our preannouncement in January. I have a separate slide on oncology coming up, so I'll focus on women's health and organ health here where we saw strong growth in the full year 2023. As the year ended, we saw an acceleration of women's health including hitting a record units per receiving day in December. This strong momentum carried into January as well and that was prior to the acquisition of Invitae's women's health assets where we're just now starting to see volume come in. In organ health, as the year progressed, we saw a return to growth in the donor derived cell free DNA business after the initial pullback in early 2023 due to the coverage changes. We think we're well positioned going forward in donor derived cell free DNA to compete given the significant body of peer reviewed evidence that we generated and the unique features of our tests. Also, we continue to see strong interest in Renasight after the RenaCARE publication. This momentum is great and we're off to a fast start across women's health, organ health and oncology. On the next slide, we're showing the ramp of our oncology business, which continues to outperform. In Q4, we did 98,000 units, another strong sequential quarter increasing by 9,000 clinical units over Q3 of 2023. For the full year of 2023, the growth rate was 73.5% over 2022. We're continuing to see strong growth across the core indications including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, muscle invasive bladder cancer and immunotherapy monitoring even as we add new indications. Roughly 40% of oncologists used Signatera in Q4, which shows the strong clinical utility of the test and we have strong momentum going into 2024. Just as critical as revenue and volume growth is the gross margin traction we are seeing. I think this slide is a good snapshot of the business maturing. Over the course of the year, our ASP and COGS initiatives delivered above our expectations, particularly in Signatera, ASP and COGS, both of which improved over the course of 2023. As I mentioned at the top of the call, we think the underlying repeatable gross margin in the quarter was roughly 49%. Our 2024 guide implies meaningful continued gross margin improvements based on ASPs and cost drivers that are within our control. In addition, we've also got a number of potential upside drivers to both revenue and gross margin that we'll discuss later in the call that aren't included in our guide. So the net result of strong revenue growth and expanding margins on stable operating expenses is a dramatic reduction in cash burn we achieved in 2023. This is essentially in line with the data we released in January. As discussed previously, we accelerated a chunk of 2024 scheduled CapEx in December to take advantage of some large year-end discounts, which has helped us set up for an efficient year in 2024. Two years ago, we set a long-term target to get a cash flow breakeven quarter this year and based on these results plus the early data we are seeing so far in Q1, we are confident that we can reach that milestone by Q3 of this year if not sooner. Of course, cash flows are dependent in part on payer response times to submitted claims and so are inherently difficult to forecast with precision on a quarterly basis. But the point is that we're continuing to build momentum and our confidence in achieving this goal is stronger than ever. Finally, I think anyone that follows this space has taken note of our results on the IP front. Since we created the category of tumor informed MRD in 2017, we've had 2 companies attempt to follow us into the space, requiring us to enforce our IP against them. The good news is that they've now both been enjoined for violating our IP. The permanent injunction against Archer and Invitae was ordered after the conclusion of a jury trial and then subsequently a preliminary injunction was entered against NeoGenomics. One notable point about these results is that different sets of patents and different judges are at issue in each of these cases, which I think demonstrates the strength of the IP estate that protects our core technology. The Natera's IP litigation offers another case in point, which generated a sizable jury verdict for damages based only on past infringement of our patents. The process is still ongoing to determine whether future royalties will be awarded. And on the Ravgen trial, we were found to not willfully infringe and the damages awarded were obviously much lower than what Ravgen was requesting, but we still respectfully disagree with the outcomes of the trial and we plan to appeal certain of the rulings. Okay. Now, let me hand it over to Solomon to discuss updates in women's health and organ health. Solomon? Yes. This is Steve. So maybe I'll just make a couple of comments on these different things, and then Mike, you can sort of talk about the magnitude. I mean certainly, there's a lot of opportunities for upside. You've listed a couple of them. I think within Invitae, we're working hard to move as many of those accounts over as we can. And we think that is going well, as we said in the prepared remarks. We'll have a little more visibility as time goes on. From a guideline standpoint, all we can really do on guidelines is produce the peer-reviewed evidence. And we feel incredibly good about the evidence that's been produced particularly on 22q and on broad panel carrier screening. Now I think it's really up to the societies and the physicians to decide what they want to do. But certainly, that would provide a lot of upside as we're the market leader in noninvasive prenatal testing. We have a high attachment rate of microdeletion testing. And as we sit here, we believe we're the market leader as well in next-gen sequencing-based broad panel test. When you look at Signatera and ASP, certainly, there's a lot of opportunities for upside, the same with biomarker bills. So Mike, do you want to comment further? Yes, Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. So first, I'll just say on ovarian and neoadjuvant breast, we're really excited about those indications. We've got some great data and more data coming out. I think generally, once we get coverage in place, that's really when the medical liaison team and commercial team can start going out and educating physicians really about the benefit. So that will take a little bit of time to come in. But certainly, there's volume there today that will benefit from Alex, do you want to talk about ALTAIR and the potential there for upside opportunity and guidelines? Yes. No, no, that makes sense, and that's a good question. So we said we're thinking somewhere in the sort of $20 million to $30 million range is a conservative number. But we also said that we think that can get up to $50 million to $60 million. So we really have to see how things come in as we look into this sort of post-acquisition window. A couple of things to note that I think are important. I think the first thing is that the volume that we started with at the end of January after the acquisition was, I think, a decent amount less than maybe where Invitae was in the last time they reported out their volume in Q3. And that makes sense because they had announced some initiatives to reduce some of their low-margin business. So for example, some of their low cash pay business. So I think the starting point for us is different maybe than what you're what your expectations were. Now with that said, we're working hard now to transition over as many of the accounts, which is generally the high-margin accounts because those were the ones that were remaining over to Natera. And we think we're doing really well. Generally, when you look at these things, you go back and you look at December 4, I know this is a little bit different than that situation. But Natera has generally done very, very well in these settings, retaining the vast majority of the business. Certainly, 50% plus of the business. And I think that's what we'll see here. And I guess last question -- sorry, I'm back, I forgot the answer. Do you think there's an opportunity there through the OB channel, and we think there's some opportunities there as well on the oncology side. So certainly, with the disruption happening, there will be some upside opportunity there. Yes, that's a good question. So I think this question of pan cancer is something that I think a lot of people have asked over time. And certainly, as you start to look at the long tail of cancers getting covered, I think at some point in the future, there may be an opportunity for just kind of across-the-board pan cancer coverage. But we haven't set up to be dependent on that. What we're doing is we're doing very thoughtful detailed clinical validations on all the different tumor types, and we're generating the data that's needed to obtain coverage. And we think that's, I think, 1 of the reasons why we're in a leadership position today is because we've done that hard work. We generated these studies. We spent now 5 or 6 years working on some of these trials and other companies, they may come in and not put that work in and then they end up not getting coverage. So we think we're a great opportunity. Obviously, there's more tumor types that are in submission. We're excited about ovarian in neoadjuvant breast, but you mentioned lung, you mentioned -- or I guess you didn't mention gastroesophageal, we think, is a big opportunity for us that fits nicely with the colorectal indication. So lots of upside. We're continuing to focus here and generate data. Yes, it's a good question. So let me just comment on Invitae first. And so what I mentioned there is that Invitae themselves had actually taken steps, I believe, in Q3 time frame of last year to exit some of their lower margin accounts or maybe move away from some of that business. And so that's why the starting point of where we took over in January was maybe a little bit different than what you might have seen from Invitae in Q3. From the Natera side, when we bring this business on, it's obviously through the Natera contracts and insurance contracts and with the Natera products. And so we think the margin should be in line with what is currently now kind of an accelerating and expanding Natera gross margin. Hopefully, that makes sense. From the upside opportunity, obviously, there's an enormous amount of upside in the guidance. We didn't include anything for 22q coverage. We didn't include anything from broad panel carrier screening. So obviously, there's upside as these things come in. If you just think about the clinical impact and the data that we generated, we really think that, that's the most important piece. 22q is a very severe disorder. It's a leading cause of congenital heart defects causes' hypocalcemia, which can lead to seizures and brain damage at birth, if it's not treated. So this is a very serious disorder. We test for it with, I think, a very well-validated test that was prospectively done over a 7-year period. We think we've checked all the boxes for society guidelines. If you look at the very high attachment rate that we have, I think 75% plus of our in IPT, get 22q. Obviously, there's upside opportunity, but we think it's really important that patients get access to this test and then it's covered by their insurance company. The same thing for expanded panel carrier screening, as we said today, we believe we're the market leader in next-gen sequencing-based expanded panel testing. But there's still opportunity there as guidelines come in place both to extend the volume today. There are still customers and OB offices around the country that are ordering smaller panels. As the guidelines come in, we think that they will transition to broader panels, which will put Natera in a good position. And there's also a lot of business today that we're just not reimbursed on where the payers maybe have a negative coverage policy where there's an opportunity to get paid and get coverage for testing that the physicians want and that we think are important for patients. Yes. So maybe I'll comment quickly on early cancer detection and then hand it over to Solomon to talk about breast cancer recurrence monitoring and some of the exciting data potentially coming around treatment on molecular recurrence. So on early cancer detection, we are planning probably in Q2 to read out a case-control study that's going to include both colorectal and advanced adenoma patients. And we're excited about that readout. The vast majority of those samples were prospectively collected and matched with colonoscopy. Not all of them, but the vast majority were. So then after that, depending -- we're going to take a look at how that data looks. Obviously, we're excited about it. After that, in October time frame, maybe sometime September, October, we're going to be reading out roughly a 1,000-patient prospective study that will be 100% colonoscopy match. That's already recruiting patients today. And then depending on the readout of there, we'll make a decision about what we do going forward as far as the FDA enabling trial. But the way that we've set this up is that the 1,000-patient study that's going to read out in Q3, that's actually the exact same protocol that would be used for the FDA enabling trial. So if we do want to go ahead with the FDA, we just continue enrolling into that study. So it's not like there's going to be a delay about the trial. Now as we said before, the decision for us is going to depend on what the performance of the test looks like. And everything that we're doing this year is included in our budget. It's not any additional cost. We said we're moving rapidly to cash flow breakeven. We're going to hit that in Q3 or sooner. So all of the expenses on early cancer detection will be included in that. We'll still be getting the cash flow breakeven the same schedule. If we do decide to move forward and view an FDA-enabling trial, that would be based on us seeing market-leading performance. And that needs to be, I think, better than anything else out there from a blood standpoint for both colorectal and advanced adenoma. So Solomon, do you want to talk about breast cancer? Alex, why don't you take that? Yes, that's a great question. I'll make a couple of comments and then maybe, Solomon, you can talk a little bit more about all the things that we've done as we look toward the future. First, I'll say there is competition. We think the tumor-informed MRD companies are the real competitors here. And particularly, I think NeoGenomics is a strong competitor. Of course, they've been in joint right now, but they have a very strong footprint. And although I think when you look at the performance of the NeoGenomics product, from an analytical standpoint, they've made some very significant claims. But if you dig into the details, they've really increased the amount of plasma input to make it seem like the test analytically performs potentially better than it does. And I think that hurts us when you look at comparative claims that they're making based on different levels of plasma input. Now when you look at the clinical validation, what we see on the radar product, is that the performance doesn't really hold up. And we see this where analytical validation or maybe looks good, but then you look at the clinical validation and it doesn't quite look as good. So you just have to be careful of that with any competitors that are making claims about the performance of their tests. Solomon, do you want to talk about some of the stuff that we've done? I think the investments that we've made into clinical data and clinical trials? And Doug, maybe I'll just add to that a little bit. I mean if you look at the different areas Solomon broke out, you look at data, I mean we now have a significant number of peer-reviewed studies that have been published. But not only that, we have multiple randomized trials that are ongoing that have been underway, some now for kind of 5 years or something in that time frame. And I think the key thing is with these randomized trials that the data really is only applicable to the test that was used in the trial. So I think we're seeing some groups now are coming, doing clinical validations where they're looking just at the performance of their test. And as you go forward, that's really not going to be good enough. You have to have a randomized study that shows how patient outcomes were impacted based on using your test in the randomized study. And that's where we're going to be and that's where we think things are going as we move forward and moving away from analytical validations and from clinical validation. Mike, do you want to take that?"

We\u2019ll quote a number of numerical growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve? \nSteve Chapman: Thanks Mike. I think our Q3 results demonstrate the strategy we're paying off and I'm excited to share the highlights. We generated $215 million in total revenue and product revenues were up 33% versus last year. Volumes were stronger again across the business with strong year-on-year growth in women's health and oncology versus Q3 of last year and a nice sequential recovery quarter for organ health. Signatera volume growth particularly continues to exceed our internal forecast and this was the second-best quarter ever in terms of the absolute unit growth in the clinical panel. As good as those topline metrics are, I'm most encouraged by the margin and cash on results. We talked about the focused effort to improve ASPs and I think that effort started to pay off this quarter. Gross margins were 45%. You'll recall we also had 45% gross margins in Q2, but we noted it was closer to 43% on a normalized basis as it had some one-time benefits. In contrast, we think this quarter represents an organic 45% based on ASP and COGS improvements. We slashed our cash burn dramatically in the quarter as well, almost a 50% reduction compared to last quarter. Clearly, we are getting leverage as revenue grew rapidly, while operating expenses was essentially flat and margins have improved. Our efforts to improve ASPs, is also leading to getting reimbursed more quickly on average from payers. Mike will talk about this later in the call, but we think this is a good sign that more ASP improvements are in store for future quarters. These results in the continued strong trends we are seeing so far in Q4 put us in a position to significantly improve our annual guidance across the board. We are raising the revenue guide once again to a completely new range and now expect to come in between $1.035 billion and $1.050 billion in total revenue for the year. We are tightening the gross margin guide to the top end of the range and are now expecting full year gross margins to land between 43% and 44% which we think implies the strong Q3 gross margins are repeatable in Q4. Finally, we are dramatically reducing our tax burn guidance for the year now expected to be $250 million to $280 million. This represents a more than $200 million reduction in cash burn versus 2022. The momentum we are seeing leaves us even more confidence that we are in a good position to repay cash flow breakeven quarter next year. And we do not believe we need any guideline changes in order to hit that milestone. The significant reduction in cash burn has largely been achieved, because our core strategy is working. We are growing revenue rapidly while reducing COGS and improving ASPs, we are keeping OpEx stable though at very competitive levels allowing us to maintain a strong commercial team and continue to focus on clinical and innovation road maps. For example over the past few years, we've made investments into technology development, product enhancements and clinical trials and these investments are now resulting in an excellent pipeline of new products and new indications to go after within our core businesses. As a result, in 2024, we expect to announce new MRD-related products and updates along with other major innovations that empower future growth. In addition on the clinical side, we have major randomized controlled trials that we expect will be read out in 2024 some of which have taken investments over five or more years to get to this point. So we think we are positioned very nicely for the future. We're on a rapid revenue growth path, while moving quickly to cash flow breakeven and doing so with our previous multiyear investments driving potential major near-term catalysts. On top of our financial results, we had several big wins during the quarter. I'll start with RenaCARE which has proven to be a landmark study for us in an area that we believe can drive significant growth overtime. Last week we announced the study publication as in JASN, a leading nephrology [indiscernible] and also share the results at the ASN Kidney Week conference. As a reminder RenaCARE is a large real-world prospective study of more than 1,600 patients that looked at the impact of genetic testing within chronic kidney disease. The finding is coding strong clinical and diagnostic utility profile for Renasight or genetic test to identify causes of CKD. The results also exceeded clinical precedents for the implementation of genetic testing within an at-risk population for example Hereditary Breast Cancer which we think is a good proxy for comparison. I don't spend too much time on this now, as Solomon will cover it in detail later in the call, but I'll just note that we're very excited to see where we go from here. Feedback from nephrologists has been positive. And we believe these results lay a strong foundation for increased adoption and coverage. The market opportunity is potentially large and notably underpenetrated with 37 million people affected by CKD in the United States. There's a significant need for reliable and actual genetic information to serve these patients and we think Renasight could be that driver backed by the strong clinical evidence we reported in the study. In oncology, we presented key colon cancer data at ESMO from the GALAXY arm of the CIRCULATE study. Notably, this analysis included 2,000 patients, which was like as many as the Nature Medicine paper as well as significantly longer follow-up at 24 months. The data provides significant insights to the predictive and prognostic value Signatera and CRC with ongoing excellent performance by Signatera. Separately, while MRV has historically been focused on the initial adjuvant draw and the adjuvant chemo decision-making, the initial MRD timepoint represents only a tiny fraction of the overall MRD opportunity. More and more we are leading the way in a new area that we call treatment on molecular relapse, which is where patients can actually receive a drug upon becoming ctDNA positive with Signatera in the surveillance setting rather than waiting for radiologic evidence of recurrence. This is part of our key vision for how the serial use of Signatera to transform cancer care and ultimately save lives. And we see it gaining real momentum now with sponsorship from both pharma and academic consortia. In fact, long-term this might be the single biggest MRD opportunity and one where we believe Natera has a meaningful first-mover advantage with multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials already underway, some which have been ongoing for several years already. So Alex will describe treatment on molecular relapse a little bit later in the call including describing the new SREP [ph] ctDNA study which seeks to show the benefits of treatment on molecular relapse in early-stage breast cancer. This is a randomized Phase 3 trial conducted across 120 sites in 12 countries led by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, otherwise known as EORTC. We also published a digital data in lung cancer, strengthening our leadership position in the patient population. In 2023 alone, we publicly presented the results for four key lung cancer cells across the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic treatment study and we've seen very strong performance. Two of these were conducted in collaboration with our partners at Foundation Medicine and demonstrated strong clinical test performance for immunotherapy monitoring. These studies helped to support the broad clinical launch and Medicare covers their FoundationOneTracker, which we also announced in October. As many of you know Tracker is a complimentary asset at Signatera with a focus on patients with advanced stage cancers. We're very excited about the launch and believe this new offering will help oncologists make the best possible decisions about the pace of care through actionable and personalized data. Great. So with that let's get into some of the business trends on the next slide. We saw continued strong growth in volumes across the major product areas as I described. In women's health, we had strong growth compared to Q3 of last year. The strong growth particularly given our ongoing efforts to reduce some volume from account where we don't see a path to stable reimbursement over time. In Organ Health we were pleased with the return to growth. As a reminder, earlier this year, reimbursement changes created some uncertainty for transplant centers about when they should order Vasistera. That uncertainty has now largely been resolved. And in Q3 we saw coming our larger customers recurring to prior levels. Both Organ Health and Women's Health represent large underserved base of population that have a critical need for the type of testing we offer. Solomon will cover the oncology volumes later in the call where the trends continue to be positive. On the next slide you can see that our revenue growth is getting a significant boost from improved reimbursement in addition to our volume growth. The left chart of total revenues, which grew 27% year-on-year, and I think that growth rate actually understates our good progress because we recorded a large one-time licensing payment in Q3 of last year. The product revenues on the right-hand side of the page we adjust for that. And as you can see product revenues were up 33% year-on-year. We made a decision last November to redouble our efforts on reimbursement and billing operations making sure that we navigate all the operational hurdles required to get reimbursement for covered service. For example, doing better on appeals when a service is denied or chasing down missing insurance information. Since then, we've made a significant investment in new processes. We've added new team members and we've identified systems and engineering opportunities. While we're still at the very early stages, it's great to see that we're starting to see these efforts come through in the financial results and there's still a long way to go. Of course, these improvements benefit both revenue growth and gross margins as you can see on the next slide. Gross margin dipped to 41% in Q4 of last year and then to 39% in Q1 of this year as we executed growth on the initiatives that we've described in the past. On the Q2 call, we described that gross margins were helped a bit by some one-time factors. In that time, we estimated the organic gross margin to be about 43% on a normalized basis. In Q3, our 45% gross margin is largely organic. We are seeing modest improvements in the NIPT and carrier ASPs and have outperformed our expectations in Signatera. For each of these products we have put in place multiple operational initiatives whose effects have not yet been fully recognized in revenue approval. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can deliver steady gains in the gross margins throughout the course of 2024. Another interesting byproduct of all this efforts is that our cap election cycle noticeably improved in Q3 compared to prior quarters, which helped drive the significant reduction in quarterly cash burn along with the revenue growth and gross margin improvement. Finally, we continue to hit our marks on cost of goods sold as we've expanded our Signatera, Exton laboratory and executed COGS projects across the company. We've got a full slate of these lab infrastructure projects and we expect to launch many of them during 2024. This has been a big area of investment within our R&D budget and it will be nice to see that investment pay off. In addition to the above cards project, we've also passed some key validation and regulatory milestones with an alternative NGF provider. We validated the Signatera technology on an alternative NGF platform and in partnership with a major pharmaceutical company achieve a regulatory milestone using that alternate platform. In addition, we validated NIPT on alternative NGF platform and past the regulatory milestones which we may now launch a version of in our centralized laboratory. All of these factors give us confidence that we are on track to get to a cash flow breakeven quarter next year. And with that, let me turn it over to Solomon, who will dive deeper on the results from RenaCARE in the Oncology business. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks Steve. I just got back to the weekend from the American Society of Nephrology, ASN, Annual Conference in Philadelphia, where renal genetics was a hot topic and where the RenaCARE paper was well received. Many doctors expressed the belief that nephrology is at the beginning of a new wave of personalized medicine similar to where oncology was as it feels 15 to 20 years ago. There are about 37 million people in the US living with CKD or roughly one in seven adults. CKD is also a significant burden on the healthcare system with roughly $85 billion of Medicare spend related to its management. Natera launched the RenaCARE study back in 2019 in collaboration with leaders from Colombia, Yale, NYU, Mayo Clinic and several other leading institutions, with the goal of determining what personalized insights can be gained from genetic testing with Natera Renasight product with 380 disease-related games. And how often a genetic diagnosis we can attain in treatment. More than 1,600 patients were enrolled across 31 sites in this real-world prospective study. The results were impressive. Some of the key headlines as you can see on the slide. One in five patients tested positive for a genetic cause of PKD meaning that a pathogenic or likely pathogen variance was found in their germline DNA. Out of the positive one in two paces received a new or reclassified diagnosis and of the positive one in three reported pain and treatment plan. At a high level when thinking about Renasight's diagnostic yield of 20.8%, let's compare it to hereditary cancer testing like the classic BRCA one and 2J. Where studies tension a test positive rate of between 5% and 17% including in cohorts that meet NCCN criteria for being high risk and that have received Medicare or commercial insurance coverage. We all know the germline DNA testing in oncology has become standard practice. So given the high yield we've seen for Renasights together with a significant clinical utility, we see a great opportunity here for exchanging standard practice in nephrology with strong potential for clinical guidelines and insurance coverage. To that end we recently submitted an application to MolDx for coverage of Renasight. So we look forward to their feedback particularly given the strength of the RenaCARE studies. a little bit deeper now on study findings. One of the key stories unfolding here is that genetic testing is useful not only in the 8% or 9% of patients without a diagnosis but also in patients who have already been given a clinical diagnosis. For background CKD has a vast spectrum of underlying causes. The current diagnostic protocols generally rely on basic measurement of kidney punting as well as imaging and biopsy. This approach has left significant gap. For example diagnoses that are nonspecific meaning that the kidney disease may be inaccurately attributed to diabetes or hypertension when in fact those may be comorbidity that mask the true cause of a patient with CKD. Similarly in the case of cystic disease it contains clinical management to now the subtype of disease whether it's driven by PKD1 or PKD2 for example. In many cases we also found that timely genetic testing could have helped the patient avoid an unnecessary invasive biopsiesa. There are more than 20 drugs already addressing gene-specific CKD targets on the market and approximately 270 clinical trials. So having a specific diagnostic information can really enhance targeted treatment options they can open doors for participation in clinical trials and ultimately it can improve outcome. For people who want to learn more we just published a good white paper on our website. In summary, the RenaCARE study provides solid evidence demonstrating that Renasight testing is useful and appropriate in the vast majority of patients presenting with PKD that it can lead to an earlier and more accurate diagnoses in standard of care practices and frequently same or refine an existing diagnosis and it can enable clinicians to tailor treatment decisions. We're very enthusiastic about the future pence of this product to help millions of people with CKD. Moving to oncology now, where we had a great quarter. Clinical signature volumes shown on the right had one of its best quarters to date in terms of absolute growth. This growth reflects a strong increase in new patient initiation continued perial testing by existing patients and significant adoption by new physicians, who had never ordered Signatera before. We believe over 35% of all US oncologists ordered Signatera in the quarter. The left-hand chart includes all clinical volumes and pharma units. As a reminder, we had a site in pharma units in Q2 which we discussed in our call in August. So we broke out the clinical volumes separately this time relative to the pharma business which is doing well but is a bit more lumpy as expected. We recently closed some big pharma projects across various cancer types, including prospective, retrospective and real-world data studies. There continues to be significant interest such that we are now expanding capacity in the RUO labs. Back to clinical Signatera, we've also continued to drive steady improvement in the average sales price outpacing our initial expectations. In Q2, our ASP was in the 800s. In Q3, it was in 900s, and now we see a near-term path getting above 1,000. This road map is being driven by better operational execution as well as anticipated Medicare coverage of new indications and expanded coverage among private payers. As a reminder, Signatera is in a unique economic position with its advanced diagnostic lab status or ADL which is very hard for other MRD labs to replicate. We believe all the data that we've been announcing and the studies underway will help drive ongoing volume growth over the near and long term. So with that let me turn it over to Alex to provide a closer look at some of those studies. Alex?\nAlexey Aleshin: Thank you Solomon. We recently presented updated 24-month data from the Galaxy cohort at this year's ESMO 2023 conference. The data continues to support and strengthen our two Seneca hypotheses that have implications to change how CRC is managed namely the MRD-positive patient's benefit from treatment, while MRD-negative patients do not. On the right-hand side of the page, CK negative patients continue to show vestinal disease-free survival, regardless of adjuvant treatment. No significant differences in DFS at 24-months were observed for CPA negative patients receiving ACT compared to those without ACT. We believe this data further dereslkomahar definitive randomized Vega study, which seeks to tablet the de-escalation strategy as a standard of care in early-stage CRC. On the left-hand side of the page, we see CPAs positive patients treated with ADP have significantly improved DSS compared to patients who undergo observations. This effect even after adjusting for all possible confounding convictions. The randomized arm of this trial known as Altera, the scheduled the readout in mid-2024, which will further assess whether the disaPAS-102 on top of chemo can further improve DFS and MRD-positive patients. We believe that, if the study is positive it would establish a pathway for a new standard of care in therapeutic treated with prive intent or tested with Signatera. As a reminder, the data on this page reflects outcomes based on single segmentary time points within eight weeks post surgery. The delta study is a key component in the protocol that allows enrollment of patients who were initially negative, but then term positive in the surveillance setting up to 24-month pose surgery. This is a new concept in MRD and is what we are calling treatment on molecular recurrence. The majority of trials and data in the MRD space today have been focused on additive and decision-making based on the first one or two time points immediately post surgery. However, we believe the largest market is treatment on molecular relapse defined as initiating treatment based on positive ctDNA status in the surveillance setting instead of waiting for clinical or radiologic recurrence. This space could be multiple orders of magnitude larger and potentially revolutionize cancer treatment by providing patients a second chance cure before avert recurrence is detected on a scan. We have seen tremendous interest in this strategy from clinicians, patients, pharmaceutical companies. These studies take years to design and run, and we recognize this opportunity over five years ago, and we now have multiple studies that are rolling in this phase, including the ones listed below. I want to highlight a new study recently announced, the Phase 3 TREAT- ctDNA trial in early stage breast cancer that is being done in collaboration with the ERTC Consortium. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether Menarini's oral endocrine monotherapy ORSERDU can delay and or prevent occurrence of distance, metastasis, or death. In patients with current Signatera positives in the late surveillance setting. The study is expected to screen approximately 1,900 patients across more than 125. And if successful, the results of the study could support broad recommendations for serial monitoring with Signatera in HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer patients. Additionally, we continue to see strong interest in the DARE and LEADER studies that are also examining treatment on molecular recurrence in breast cancer patients, and should be reading out in the 2024 to 2025 time frame. We continue to generate new clinical data to support Signatera reimbursement in an expanding list of indications. Today, we want to highlight non-small cell lung cancer, where in 2023 we have generated multiple present patients and public patients in neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings, including radiotherapy and immunotherapy treatment response monitoring. We have seen immunotherapies transition from being utilized primarily in late-stage non-small cell lung cancer to earlier stages of disease. With the recent approval of these infants in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and terioperative settings, this has resulted in a significant expense of IO treatment eligible patients. A setting where Signatera is well-positioned to serve, given the strength of our data and existing reimbursement for IO monitoring. In the adjuvant and surveillance setting, we continue to achieve exceptional solicitation, producing 100% across multiple studies, a key performance factor that many competitors have struggled with. In the recently published LIBO study of state 1 to 3 lung cancer patients, we observed an 82% detection for treatment and 100% longitudinal sensitivity to a recurrence with a median of 162 days lead time. This build previously presented data in the AVO study showing a 93% longitudinal sensitivity to recurrence, broad set of data so a very strong performance across all key metrics. We believe these various datasets are critical to establishing clinical utility, achieving reimbursement and maintaining market leadership in emerging indications like non-small cell lung cancer. The strength of the data has led to interest in prospective clinical trials, with the first Signatera trials in the state now being launched. We plan to provide further updates on our prospective evidence generation strategy during future call. Lastly, we want to highlight that we are now expanding our data generation efforts with partners like Foundation Medicine, where the cracker product was utilized either exclusively or in combination with Signatera in both the EMPower 1 and IMPower131 studies. Building on the strength of this evidence and the recently announced Medicare coverage for IO monitoring, we are excited to highlight the FoundationOne Tracker product that is now available across the U.S. This innovative assay combines the genomic information derived from the FoundationOne CDx Q-based comprehensive genomic profiling test with a personalized assay design and seek DNA analysis from Natera.  We believe this is a great win for patients, given this product will enable greater access to impaired core technology when it may be limited or previously exhausted. We are excited for the additive effect of the partnership for our core monitoring business and excited to present additional clinical data to support the value of integrated informed PPD monitoring into routine clinical practice. Now handing it over to Mike to review our financial detail. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks Alex. The first slide is just our standard results slide. We can see again that revenues were up substantially versus last year despite the fact that we had a very large licensing quarter in Q3 as Steve mentioned. So that really highlights how strong our product revenue growth has been over the last year and also gives me some confidence that the gross margins are sustainable. Operating expenses for some modest growth versus Q3 last year. But this year we've been effectively flat in sequential quarters now even as we delivered significantly faster revenue growth. The balance includes proceeds from the equity raise in September though we remain in a very strong capital position. The next slide highlights the cash burn dynamics we've seen in the last year and a half. You can see we were burning roughly $115 million to $120 million a quarter on average in 2022 as we set up all the infrastructure needed to deliver a first-class launch of Signatera. We stepped down to $80 million to $90 million a quarter burn as volumes and reimbursement grew rapidly. And now we've put that cash burn roughly in half in here in Q3. As Steve described we placed a lot of emphasis on getting reimbursement recently for covered services. And while we are still in the early innings of that effort we do think you'll be getting some results here in Q3. Days sales outstanding fell dramatically in the quarter and now stand in the low 90s. I'll offer the standard caveats here. We fully expect cash burn to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and given our COGS projects are all on track we do have some large topic than we planned in Q4. However, I think the trend you see here in the car dinette continued progress and we expect to see more of that next year. Great. Let's get to the 2023 guide on the next page. As Steve described, we are once again in a position to completely rerate the revenue guide upwards and now expect to come in at $1.035 billion to $1.050 billion. We are pleased to be tightening the original gross margin guide drop into the range. And since the OpEx guide is remaining unchanged that means we cannot significantly reduce our expected cash burn guide for the year and now expect it to be $260 million to $280 million. For many of you that have followed us for some time, you'll know that we try to set forecast that requires good, but achievable execution. And I think that's what this guide implies. We've got to continue to grow margins and they clean the ASP improvements we obtained this year. This guide does not imply however continued growth in ASP. Obviously, we are focused on making that happen, but there's always some uncertainty around the specific timing of ASP improvement, which is why we are reserving that as upside to the guide per our usual practice. As Steve described, we are feeling very positive about 2024 and we feel like we've got the right-sized sales team to continue driving growth given units are largely a function of sales rep productivity and rep counts are remaining stable next year. I think repeating the same unit growth we achieved this year is a good target. This will require good execution because our commercial team will ultimately to manage a larger book of existing business at the same time as they're growing those units. In addition to this particular volume upside, we are now starting to see revenue increase at a faster pace as ASP improves. So if our strong ASP trends continue that could be another factor helping us in 2024. On revenues we've got the potential for a number of further upside tailwinds that I would regard as upside to our base forecast. We are cautiously optimistic on 2022 and broad panel carrier screening guidelines and footnote inclusion in NCCN guidelines. Based on the [indiscernible] of meetings we've been publicly announced from these guideline committees we would expect update relatively early in 2024. I'll say it again that we do not need the fit our tax flow breakeven targets in order to continue making progress on ASP which could support steady improvements in the gross margin over the course of the next year. We expect operating expense to be relatively stable in 2024 compared to 2023. We've talked about the commercial team and we are rapidly getting operating leverage on our lab infrastructure for Signatera. Holding R&D expenses study will still allow us to make critical investments in prospective clinical trials and contingent sold reductions. We are also planning to launch a leader compelling new products and we are looking forward to talking more about those in the future. Our overarching goal in 2024 is to get to pace breakeven without sacrificing growth and innovation. Given that objective, we're planning to spend only about $15 million next year on early cancer detach. That investment will still allow us to deliver two significant data readouts one of it will come by either the end of this year or very early in Q1 and the other in the first half of 2024. If those data was very strong and pass-through investment criteria then we would evaluate moving forward with the program. Given the goals we have in front of us in our core products we will only put further into this area in the future if we see excellent results that we think can be market leading and we're hitting our cash flow goals. So we're really excited to be talking about the future of Natera and with that let me open it up to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hi, guys. Good evening and thanks for the time here. Congrats on a great quarter. Steve, Mike just in light of your comments that you didn't really have any benefit from onetimers year in the quarter on either revenue or gross margin. Can you just help us contextualize that implied fourth quarter guidance. It looks like you're pointing to sort of flattish growth sequentially and flattish gross margins as well for my quick math. So any color on sort of any offsets that we should think versus the typical year-end seasonality.\nMichael Brophy: Hi, Tejas. Thanks for the question. It's Mike here. Yes look on the guide I think on the gross margins I think that's just tightening to the top end of that range implies similar or better gross margins in Q4. As you guys know we don't guide specifically to quarters. So there's a level of caution there. I don't think that should be taken as a message about concerns about underlying trends. As you've heard in the prepared remarks the underlying trends that really across the business remain incredibly strong. I echo this similar sentiments on the revenue line. Volumes typically follow a pattern where Q2 and Q3 are kind of our weaker quarters in terms of the seasonality from the women's health business. Q1 is our strongest quarter but usually Q4 is also a good quarter as well. So we felt we're off to a good start with Q4. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean our approach to providing guidance is always to try to provide good but achievable benchmarks for financial guidance and we hope to be able to exceed this.\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. I'll just add. This is Steve. We're off to I would say an incredibly strong start in Q4 and we're continuing to see I think acceleration in ASPs and in volumes.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's super helpful color. And then guys a couple in terms of the follow-up here, one on Signatera. Can you just update us on your status with BFCA [ph]. And I know this is a immaterial part of revenue but it's a question that we've gotten from investors here. And how do you juxtapose that with the biomarker bill being passed in California, you've got the F1 tracker opportunity coming up as well. So any color on that? And then my second part of the follow-up is actually on Renasight. Given the really strong results here in RenaCARE. How are you thinking about the slope of that adoption curve? I think in the past Steve you had mentioned about -- you mentioned the 37 million patient population, but about 750,000 newly diagnosed annually. So just any color in terms of the slope of the uptake there, and early feedback from payers and nephrologists would be fantastic? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yeah. Thanks a lot. So I guess first just on commercial payers and the biomarker bill, I think some of the other groups that have presented have talked quite a bit about that. We're, obviously, monitoring things. We're taking a little bit of a more cautious approach. We want to see how things actually come through. But the reality is the biomarker builds are in place now and passed in a significant number of very critical states. So we think that it could serve as an opportunity I think to quicken the traditional pace that you see for commercial coverage. And, obviously, with California passing that's resolved things with Blue Shield of California. But overall I would say this biomarker bill is a net positive. It's something that is unique for its time period and not an opportunity that's been available previously. So frankly this might end up being the quickest path to get commercial coverage versus what we've seen historically. From a Renasight standpoint, I think the RenaCARE study, we think is a real inflection point. We've already previously said about 40% of nephrologists have used the product, we've done tens of thousands of tests at this stage and the excitement from the nephrology community and the interest is incredible. I mean it's like something that I haven't experienced before where nephrologists are really welcoming this product in with open arms. They're very engaged they -- it's like they've been starving for a product like this. So, we're excited about that. With that said, any time you're introducing something new, it does take a while to get protocols in place and get that type of market penetration that could be impactful. When I think about the market size, I think a very direct comparison here can be made with hereditary cancer testing. There you have a very similar situation where you have the sort of incident and prevalent pools. And frankly, they're a similar size. And hereditary cancer testing today is an incredibly large opportunity. And so, we think we're laying the groundwork for something similar.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nQ \u2013 Puneet Souda: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. So first one on ASP, then I have a follow-up on guidelines -- on ASP, I mean it's good to see the improvement. And I appreciate you giving the details on Signatera. But could you talk about what -- how much was the ASP improvement on the Panorama and Horizon side? And sort of what should we expect there. And then on Signatera, could you outline what's the ceiling here, given the ADLT rate you have the reimbursement, the indication expansions that you're seeing and potentially guideline and inclusion ahead as well, which could help with commercial payers. So maybe just talk about ASP.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Puneet. I appreciate the question. So yes, first on the ASPs, we saw in addition to continued pretty rapid improvement in the Signatera ASPs, which we covered. We also saw some very encouraging improvement in the women's health, ASPs. I mean I think and that's both for Panorama and for carrier screening. You may recall that earlier in the year, we actually guided assuming some erosion in the ASPs in that category. And at the time, I said, look it's not because we're seeing it but it's kind of more of a focal point. And frankly, we haven't seen that erosion. And indeed we've seen some, we've actually seen some improvement. Now where does that improvement come from? It really comes from a variety of sources and it's small contributions from a range of the efforts that we've been we've been really making over the last year, and Steve covered in some detail on the call. So, leading the guidelines aside, which I think could be very impactful, I'm actually quite encouraged about the trajectory that we're seeing right now on ASPs in women's health, I have to say nothing of the rapid improvement we've seen in the signatory ASPs, which we did expect. Second question, can you just remind you again, just give me a follow-up again one more time.\nQ \u2013 Puneet Souda: Yes. Just what is the ceiling for Signatera, and how you think about that with the ADLT indication expansions?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. So I think Solomon covered it in the prepared remarks that just based on what we're seeing right now just on the current coverage dynamics that we have on our current tumor types we feel like there's a path beyond $1000 just through kind of grinding and blocking and tackling and making sure that we get paid for covered services. And we clear all of the myriad kind of administrative hurdles that one typically encounters in this space. So that's a lot of room to run from where we are now. I wouldn't put a ceiling on that per se. I mean I think at about the time that we're reaching those levels we're going to have more data. We're going to have feedback from NCCN and then also we'll have prospective randomized data we'll have data in a number of different sources. Steve touched also on the biomarker legislation. So there's some other potential catalysts that are going to hit roughly contemporaneously. So I would expect kind of a fairly smooth trajectory to say the areas piece which is really encouraging.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I'll just add too. I think one of the things that is really exciting is as we're looking now at this very clear path to cash flow breakeven in 2024 and a very strong revenue growth ahead that we're not really incorporating any of the upside opportunity from guideline changes, things like in 22q, or any of the upside opportunity from biomarker legislation, which was just asked about a minute ago. So, the model that we're looking at really just includes sort of status quo and blocking and tackling and billing operations improvements, but all of those other things are really upside, potentially very significant upside that we just don't need to get to cash flow breakeven and have another good year.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Super helpful. And then on guidelines, wondering maybe a part A and B to this question. Could you clarify on the women's health side, Mike, did you say you're expecting to see 22q guideline update in early 2024? I just wasn't sure if I heard that correctly. And then on the NCCN for the Signatera side, could you maybe elaborate -- given the number of data sets that you have already with ALTAIR and treat ctDNA coming up. I guess the question is when does this translate into NCCN guideline inclusion? What that guideline inclusion can look like? If you could -- if maybe Alex or Solomon can elaborate on that. thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. First, let me just talk about women's health. So, of course, we don't have any information on exactly what happened and so forth. But we do know that there was a guideline committee meeting, I think in September from ACOG. And if you start to think about just sort of the timeline that you might see the results from that, I think that could be in Q1. We don't know either way whether things will be positive or negative, but we feel really strong about the fundamentals behind 22q testing that are outlined in the SMART study and behind the fundamentals of expanded carrier screening. So, we'll just have to stay tuned and see what happens there. From the NCCN side of things, when you look at kind of the -- I think there was a meeting in August, we're expecting to kind of hear an outcome from that maybe later this year or early next year. We do know that the CIRCULATE 18-month data was included in the review because it was submitted in time. But of course we don't know the outcome. Now, the great thing for Natera is because we started working on randomized controlled trials in the escalation setting for example, ALTAIR, more than five years ago. In 2024, we will actually have the results -- initial results from ALTAIR reading out. So, regardless of what the guideline committee says this year with respect to the CIRCULATE study, next year the ALTAIR results will be out. And so it's just really a matter of time assuming the trial reads out positively and that's why we feel very positive about things. And when you look at what setting is ALTAIR. I think it has sort of two settings. One is treatment escalation. But then the other is a treatment on molecular recurrence components where patients from the VEGA study that are initially negative are being monitored with ctDNA. And when they screen positive, they flip over into the Altera Arm and are randomized at that time. And then are either treated or not treated. So we're excited about that treatment on molecular recurrence readout as well which we think -- I think is another reason why Surveillance Testing is important. So look forward to having both of those read out. Alex or Solomon, would you like to add anything else or? Yeah. Okay.\nSolomon Moshkevich: No.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey guys congrats on the quarter. And thanks for the questions. I guess, first, Steve, I think you mentioned planning to launch some new MRD products next year. Could you give any additional details on that? Will that be additional indications? Or are you more referencing a new platform like the potential for a Liquid Exome or Tumor-Na\u00efve kind of off-the-shelf version?\nSteve Chapma: Yeah. So we're going to have multiple new things that are coming out, not just in MRD but across the business. And we've been investing heavily in research and development and innovation really the entire history of the company, but particularly over the last couple of years. And I think that's now going to start to bear fruit as we have a significant number of product launches and updates next year. So on the MRD side, I would expect to hear multiple different opportunities both new products and product updates.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. Great. And then you mentioned validating Signatera and NIPT on an alternative NGS provider. Any additional color you can give there? What's the timeline to rolling out NIPT on the alternative sequence here in your central lab? And is the plan to switch all of your volumes over.\nSteve Chapma: Yeah. So I think you guys sort of know the history here of the evolution of sequencing. And really over the last several years, we've seen the market open up quite a bit. And now we've done work on multiple different instruments. And we think there's, many different groups out there. So it's great that we've been able to meet regulatory milestones. And in collaboration with pharma partners validate Signatera and independently now validate NIPT on these alternative platforms. We're focusing on reducing our COGS and getting to cash flow breakeven. And so we're going to make the best decision for Natera on what provider we use, based on the service level, the price and the quality.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter you guys. So first off, nice to see the coverage of the FoundationOne Tracker in the US last month. Can you just kind of walk us through how should we size that opportunity? And then, how quickly can it become a meaningful contributor here.\nSteve Chapma: Yeah, Solomon, why don't you take that?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Yeah. Thank you for the question. We were very excited about getting that coverage for Medicare. And we thought it was appropriate given the great data that's already been generated to support the tests. FoundationOne Tracker is very well positioned, for patients in the advanced cancer study who are already getting a FoundationOne CDx test and want to monitor response to immunotherapy without needing to send another tissue sample for development of Signatera and that's especially useful for patients where tissue might be scarce already exhausted after the first analysis for genomic profiling. So that's exciting and we look forward to rolling that out that commercialization being led by Foundation Medicine, and helping a lot of patients.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask about the pending lawsuits that you guys have with Rabgen in the upcoming trial in early next year. You have one peer that had to pay out in the high $200 million range but other peers have settled out of court. You had one peer earlier this week flagged that their payout is going to be in that like $30 million range all in. So, can you just walk us through what are the potential range of outcomes that we could see for tissue? And any color on dates leading up to that trial? Thank you.\nMichael Brophy: Hey, Rachel. Thanks for the question. So just like all the intending litigation unfortunately I just can't get into a lot of details on ongoing litigations -- we clearly believe we don't infringe. We don't think the patents are valid and we feel that we've got some very strong defenses. And that's kind of where we've got to leave it for now. But we look forward to providing more updates as they become available.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for the question. Maybe the first one Mike you talked about some of the screening data that's coming out later this year and early next year and you talked about if the data looks very strong you would evaluate and move forward only excellent results. Can you give us a sense of what we expect to see here coming up in these two studies? And just any more color around the level of evidence you would need in order to push ahead?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So, this is Steve. I'll take that. So we've said before we have a case-controlled study that's coming out probably at the end of this year maybe in early January. And then we're following that up with an additional study looking at advanced cetinoma. And once we have both of those in hand we're going to sort of see how we measure up to others that are out there. And I think there's sort of two decision points there. There's -- how do we compare to the competition and where are we on our trajectory to cash flow breakeven and how do the financials look. And we're not going to do anything at all that's going to impact our ability to get to cash flow breakeven. So we think we're taking the right unmeasured approach and phase-gated approach where we're waiting to hit key milestones before we decide whether we're moving the ball forward or not. And if we do move the ball forward the -- I think, the next steps would really be in 2025 in 2026, where we'll be operating in a different environment where we think we'll be cash flow positive.\nDan Brennan: Got it. Thanks a lot. And then maybe just another one on NTCN, just if you are successful getting, an inclusion maybe as a footnote in the current update that you expect early next year like what would that what does that mean? Obviously commercial coverage could start and you'd likely I guess see a volume benefit to maybe just clarify. And then as a related question, obviously, the GALAXY 24-month data and the MRD-positive arm looked really impressive. How much does that derisk ALTAIR? I know you kind of mentioned -- but I think the regimen might be a little bit different ALTAIR. Just wondering how much of confidence that gives you in ALTAIR positive readout. Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Let me just talk quickly about guidelines and then I'll have Alex comment on the CIRCULATE data. So the -- why do you -- you need guidelines to grow volume and to get commercial reimbursement. And we're growing volume right now at a really fast pace. And we're also now seeing commercial reimbursement coming on, and because of the biomarker bill, we think that's going to continue. So at this point, it's -- I think guidelines obviously would quicken the pace of those things. But, we're going to get really far along here without guidelines coming in. And I think importantly for Natera, we don't need guidelines to achieve cash flow breakeven and continue to significantly grow the business. So we'll wait and see what happens -- but if we don\u2019t end up getting it this time around we have the ALTAIR study coming out and we'll be in a great position. So Alex, do you want to comment on the CIRCULATE data whether that's derisked ALTAIR Vega.\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes, absolutely Steve. So we definitely have seen continuation of separation of the curves in the CT positive arm in the CIRCULATE study. And furthermore, we've seen that in the CT negative arm, we continue to see very little if any benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. And that absolute difference has shrunken and actually we've seen those curves now reverse. We think actually both of those help derisk not just the ALTAIR study but also the Vega study. And since ALTAIR is coming up just around the corner, I think the way we are extrapolating these findings is that CT positive patients have almost 100% risk of recurrence without treatment. We've seen that adjuvant chemotherapy helps reduce that risk but does not eliminate that. And the way that healthcare is designed, we are adding a known active agent TAS-102 that's already approved in colorectal cancer and is none to have efficacy even in the second and third-line setting. So by adding that and randomizing patients to either get that drug or get placebo, we are pretty confident that there will be an effect that should be able to bear out from that study. Again, we won't know the results until the study is unblinded. But I think given the study design, given the findings so far from the CIRCULATE data, we're very positive. But we should be able to see something if the effect is there.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude the allotted time that we have for question and answers. I will now hand the call back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nMichael Brophy: Hey, thanks operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We're really excited about these results, and we're very pleased to share with you. So, thanks again for joining.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks Steve. I just got back to the weekend from the American Society of Nephrology, ASN, Annual Conference in Philadelphia, where renal genetics was a hot topic and where the RenaCARE paper was well received. Many doctors expressed the belief that nephrology is at the beginning of a new wave of personalized medicine similar to where oncology was as it feels 15 to 20 years ago. There are about 37 million people in the US living with CKD or roughly one in seven adults. CKD is also a significant burden on the healthcare system with roughly $85 billion of Medicare spend related to its management. Natera launched the RenaCARE study back in 2019 in collaboration with leaders from Colombia, Yale, NYU, Mayo Clinic and several other leading institutions, with the goal of determining what personalized insights can be gained from genetic testing with Natera Renasight product with 380 disease-related games. And how often a genetic diagnosis we can attain in treatment. More than 1,600 patients were enrolled across 31 sites in this real-world prospective study. The results were impressive. Some of the key headlines as you can see on the slide. One in five patients tested positive for a genetic cause of PKD meaning that a pathogenic or likely pathogen variance was found in their germline DNA. Out of the positive one in two paces received a new or reclassified diagnosis and of the positive one in three reported pain and treatment plan. At a high level when thinking about Renasight's diagnostic yield of 20.8%, let's compare it to hereditary cancer testing like the classic BRCA one and 2J. Where studies tension a test positive rate of between 5% and 17% including in cohorts that meet NCCN criteria for being high risk and that have received Medicare or commercial insurance coverage. We all know the germline DNA testing in oncology has become standard practice. So given the high yield we've seen for Renasights together with a significant clinical utility, we see a great opportunity here for exchanging standard practice in nephrology with strong potential for clinical guidelines and insurance coverage. To that end we recently submitted an application to MolDx for coverage of Renasight. So we look forward to their feedback particularly given the strength of the RenaCARE studies. a little bit deeper now on study findings. One of the key stories unfolding here is that genetic testing is useful not only in the 8% or 9% of patients without a diagnosis but also in patients who have already been given a clinical diagnosis. For background CKD has a vast spectrum of underlying causes. The current diagnostic protocols generally rely on basic measurement of kidney punting as well as imaging and biopsy. This approach has left significant gap. For example diagnoses that are nonspecific meaning that the kidney disease may be inaccurately attributed to diabetes or hypertension when in fact those may be comorbidity that mask the true cause of a patient with CKD. Similarly in the case of cystic disease it contains clinical management to now the subtype of disease whether it's driven by PKD1 or PKD2 for example. In many cases we also found that timely genetic testing could have helped the patient avoid an unnecessary invasive biopsiesa. There are more than 20 drugs already addressing gene-specific CKD targets on the market and approximately 270 clinical trials. So having a specific diagnostic information can really enhance targeted treatment options they can open doors for participation in clinical trials and ultimately it can improve outcome. For people who want to learn more we just published a good white paper on our website. In summary, the RenaCARE study provides solid evidence demonstrating that Renasight testing is useful and appropriate in the vast majority of patients presenting with PKD that it can lead to an earlier and more accurate diagnoses in standard of care practices and frequently same or refine an existing diagnosis and it can enable clinicians to tailor treatment decisions. We're very enthusiastic about the future pence of this product to help millions of people with CKD. Moving to oncology now, where we had a great quarter. Clinical signature volumes shown on the right had one of its best quarters to date in terms of absolute growth. This growth reflects a strong increase in new patient initiation continued perial testing by existing patients and significant adoption by new physicians, who had never ordered Signatera before. We believe over 35% of all US oncologists ordered Signatera in the quarter. The left-hand chart includes all clinical volumes and pharma units. As a reminder, we had a site in pharma units in Q2 which we discussed in our call in August. So we broke out the clinical volumes separately this time relative to the pharma business which is doing well but is a bit more lumpy as expected. We recently closed some big pharma projects across various cancer types, including prospective, retrospective and real-world data studies. There continues to be significant interest such that we are now expanding capacity in the RUO labs. Back to clinical Signatera, we've also continued to drive steady improvement in the average sales price outpacing our initial expectations. In Q2, our ASP was in the 800s. In Q3, it was in 900s, and now we see a near-term path getting above 1,000. This road map is being driven by better operational execution as well as anticipated Medicare coverage of new indications and expanded coverage among private payers. As a reminder, Signatera is in a unique economic position with its advanced diagnostic lab status or ADL which is very hard for other MRD labs to replicate. We believe all the data that we've been announcing and the studies underway will help drive ongoing volume growth over the near and long term. So with that let me turn it over to Alex to provide a closer look at some of those studies. Alex? No. Sure. Yeah. Thank you for the question. We were very excited about getting that coverage for Medicare. And we thought it was appropriate given the great data that's already been generated to support the tests. FoundationOne Tracker is very well positioned, for patients in the advanced cancer study who are already getting a FoundationOne CDx test and want to monitor response to immunotherapy without needing to send another tissue sample for development of Signatera and that's especially useful for patients where tissue might be scarce already exhausted after the first analysis for genomic profiling. So that's exciting and we look forward to rolling that out that commercialization being led by Foundation Medicine, and helping a lot of patients."

            "name": "Alexey Aleshin",
            "content": "Thank you Solomon. We recently presented updated 24-month data from the Galaxy cohort at this year's ESMO 2023 conference. The data continues to support and strengthen our two Seneca hypotheses that have implications to change how CRC is managed namely the MRD-positive patient's benefit from treatment, while MRD-negative patients do not. On the right-hand side of the page, CK negative patients continue to show vestinal disease-free survival, regardless of adjuvant treatment. No significant differences in DFS at 24-months were observed for CPA negative patients receiving ACT compared to those without ACT. We believe this data further dereslkomahar definitive randomized Vega study, which seeks to tablet the de-escalation strategy as a standard of care in early-stage CRC. On the left-hand side of the page, we see CPAs positive patients treated with ADP have significantly improved DSS compared to patients who undergo observations. This effect even after adjusting for all possible confounding convictions. The randomized arm of this trial known as Altera, the scheduled the readout in mid-2024, which will further assess whether the disaPAS-102 on top of chemo can further improve DFS and MRD-positive patients. We believe that, if the study is positive it would establish a pathway for a new standard of care in therapeutic treated with prive intent or tested with Signatera. As a reminder, the data on this page reflects outcomes based on single segmentary time points within eight weeks post surgery. The delta study is a key component in the protocol that allows enrollment of patients who were initially negative, but then term positive in the surveillance setting up to 24-month pose surgery. This is a new concept in MRD and is what we are calling treatment on molecular recurrence. The majority of trials and data in the MRD space today have been focused on additive and decision-making based on the first one or two time points immediately post surgery. However, we believe the largest market is treatment on molecular relapse defined as initiating treatment based on positive ctDNA status in the surveillance setting instead of waiting for clinical or radiologic recurrence. This space could be multiple orders of magnitude larger and potentially revolutionize cancer treatment by providing patients a second chance cure before avert recurrence is detected on a scan. We have seen tremendous interest in this strategy from clinicians, patients, pharmaceutical companies. These studies take years to design and run, and we recognize this opportunity over five years ago, and we now have multiple studies that are rolling in this phase, including the ones listed below. I want to highlight a new study recently announced, the Phase 3 TREAT- ctDNA trial in early stage breast cancer that is being done in collaboration with the ERTC Consortium. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether Menarini's oral endocrine monotherapy ORSERDU can delay and or prevent occurrence of distance, metastasis, or death. In patients with current Signatera positives in the late surveillance setting. The study is expected to screen approximately 1,900 patients across more than 125. And if successful, the results of the study could support broad recommendations for serial monitoring with Signatera in HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer patients. Additionally, we continue to see strong interest in the DARE and LEADER studies that are also examining treatment on molecular recurrence in breast cancer patients, and should be reading out in the 2024 to 2025 time frame. We continue to generate new clinical data to support Signatera reimbursement in an expanding list of indications. Today, we want to highlight non-small cell lung cancer, where in 2023 we have generated multiple present patients and public patients in neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings, including radiotherapy and immunotherapy treatment response monitoring. We have seen immunotherapies transition from being utilized primarily in late-stage non-small cell lung cancer to earlier stages of disease. With the recent approval of these infants in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and terioperative settings, this has resulted in a significant expense of IO treatment eligible patients. A setting where Signatera is well-positioned to serve, given the strength of our data and existing reimbursement for IO monitoring. In the adjuvant and surveillance setting, we continue to achieve exceptional solicitation, producing 100% across multiple studies, a key performance factor that many competitors have struggled with. In the recently published LIBO study of state 1 to 3 lung cancer patients, we observed an 82% detection for treatment and 100% longitudinal sensitivity to a recurrence with a median of 162 days lead time. This build previously presented data in the AVO study showing a 93% longitudinal sensitivity to recurrence, broad set of data so a very strong performance across all key metrics. We believe these various datasets are critical to establishing clinical utility, achieving reimbursement and maintaining market leadership in emerging indications like non-small cell lung cancer. The strength of the data has led to interest in prospective clinical trials, with the first Signatera trials in the state now being launched. We plan to provide further updates on our prospective evidence generation strategy during future call. Lastly, we want to highlight that we are now expanding our data generation efforts with partners like Foundation Medicine, where the cracker product was utilized either exclusively or in combination with Signatera in both the EMPower 1 and IMPower131 studies. Building on the strength of this evidence and the recently announced Medicare coverage for IO monitoring, we are excited to highlight the FoundationOne Tracker product that is now available across the U.S. This innovative assay combines the genomic information derived from the FoundationOne CDx Q-based comprehensive genomic profiling test with a personalized assay design and seek DNA analysis from Natera.  We believe this is a great win for patients, given this product will enable greater access to impaired core technology when it may be limited or previously exhausted. We are excited for the additive effect of the partnership for our core monitoring business and excited to present additional clinical data to support the value of integrated informed PPD monitoring into routine clinical practice. Now handing it over to Mike to review our financial detail. Mike? Yes, absolutely Steve. So we definitely have seen continuation of separation of the curves in the CT positive arm in the CIRCULATE study. And furthermore, we've seen that in the CT negative arm, we continue to see very little if any benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. And that absolute difference has shrunken and actually we've seen those curves now reverse. We think actually both of those help derisk not just the ALTAIR study but also the Vega study. And since ALTAIR is coming up just around the corner, I think the way we are extrapolating these findings is that CT positive patients have almost 100% risk of recurrence without treatment. We've seen that adjuvant chemotherapy helps reduce that risk but does not eliminate that. And the way that healthcare is designed, we are adding a known active agent TAS-102 that's already approved in colorectal cancer and is none to have efficacy even in the second and third-line setting. So by adding that and randomizing patients to either get that drug or get placebo, we are pretty confident that there will be an effect that should be able to bear out from that study. Again, we won't know the results until the study is unblinded. But I think given the study design, given the findings so far from the CIRCULATE data, we're very positive. But we should be able to see something if the effect is there."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. I think our Q3 results demonstrate the strategy we're paying off and I'm excited to share the highlights. We generated $215 million in total revenue and product revenues were up 33% versus last year. Volumes were stronger again across the business with strong year-on-year growth in women's health and oncology versus Q3 of last year and a nice sequential recovery quarter for organ health. Signatera volume growth particularly continues to exceed our internal forecast and this was the second-best quarter ever in terms of the absolute unit growth in the clinical panel. As good as those topline metrics are, I'm most encouraged by the margin and cash on results. We talked about the focused effort to improve ASPs and I think that effort started to pay off this quarter. Gross margins were 45%. You'll recall we also had 45% gross margins in Q2, but we noted it was closer to 43% on a normalized basis as it had some one-time benefits. In contrast, we think this quarter represents an organic 45% based on ASP and COGS improvements. We slashed our cash burn dramatically in the quarter as well, almost a 50% reduction compared to last quarter. Clearly, we are getting leverage as revenue grew rapidly, while operating expenses was essentially flat and margins have improved. Our efforts to improve ASPs, is also leading to getting reimbursed more quickly on average from payers. Mike will talk about this later in the call, but we think this is a good sign that more ASP improvements are in store for future quarters. These results in the continued strong trends we are seeing so far in Q4 put us in a position to significantly improve our annual guidance across the board. We are raising the revenue guide once again to a completely new range and now expect to come in between $1.035 billion and $1.050 billion in total revenue for the year. We are tightening the gross margin guide to the top end of the range and are now expecting full year gross margins to land between 43% and 44% which we think implies the strong Q3 gross margins are repeatable in Q4. Finally, we are dramatically reducing our tax burn guidance for the year now expected to be $250 million to $280 million. This represents a more than $200 million reduction in cash burn versus 2022. The momentum we are seeing leaves us even more confidence that we are in a good position to repay cash flow breakeven quarter next year. And we do not believe we need any guideline changes in order to hit that milestone. The significant reduction in cash burn has largely been achieved, because our core strategy is working. We are growing revenue rapidly while reducing COGS and improving ASPs, we are keeping OpEx stable though at very competitive levels allowing us to maintain a strong commercial team and continue to focus on clinical and innovation road maps. For example over the past few years, we've made investments into technology development, product enhancements and clinical trials and these investments are now resulting in an excellent pipeline of new products and new indications to go after within our core businesses. As a result, in 2024, we expect to announce new MRD-related products and updates along with other major innovations that empower future growth. In addition on the clinical side, we have major randomized controlled trials that we expect will be read out in 2024 some of which have taken investments over five or more years to get to this point. So we think we are positioned very nicely for the future. We're on a rapid revenue growth path, while moving quickly to cash flow breakeven and doing so with our previous multiyear investments driving potential major near-term catalysts. On top of our financial results, we had several big wins during the quarter. I'll start with RenaCARE which has proven to be a landmark study for us in an area that we believe can drive significant growth overtime. Last week we announced the study publication as in JASN, a leading nephrology [indiscernible] and also share the results at the ASN Kidney Week conference. As a reminder RenaCARE is a large real-world prospective study of more than 1,600 patients that looked at the impact of genetic testing within chronic kidney disease. The finding is coding strong clinical and diagnostic utility profile for Renasight or genetic test to identify causes of CKD. The results also exceeded clinical precedents for the implementation of genetic testing within an at-risk population for example Hereditary Breast Cancer which we think is a good proxy for comparison. I don't spend too much time on this now, as Solomon will cover it in detail later in the call, but I'll just note that we're very excited to see where we go from here. Feedback from nephrologists has been positive. And we believe these results lay a strong foundation for increased adoption and coverage. The market opportunity is potentially large and notably underpenetrated with 37 million people affected by CKD in the United States. There's a significant need for reliable and actual genetic information to serve these patients and we think Renasight could be that driver backed by the strong clinical evidence we reported in the study. In oncology, we presented key colon cancer data at ESMO from the GALAXY arm of the CIRCULATE study. Notably, this analysis included 2,000 patients, which was like as many as the Nature Medicine paper as well as significantly longer follow-up at 24 months. The data provides significant insights to the predictive and prognostic value Signatera and CRC with ongoing excellent performance by Signatera. Separately, while MRV has historically been focused on the initial adjuvant draw and the adjuvant chemo decision-making, the initial MRD timepoint represents only a tiny fraction of the overall MRD opportunity. More and more we are leading the way in a new area that we call treatment on molecular relapse, which is where patients can actually receive a drug upon becoming ctDNA positive with Signatera in the surveillance setting rather than waiting for radiologic evidence of recurrence. This is part of our key vision for how the serial use of Signatera to transform cancer care and ultimately save lives. And we see it gaining real momentum now with sponsorship from both pharma and academic consortia. In fact, long-term this might be the single biggest MRD opportunity and one where we believe Natera has a meaningful first-mover advantage with multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials already underway, some which have been ongoing for several years already. So Alex will describe treatment on molecular relapse a little bit later in the call including describing the new SREP [ph] ctDNA study which seeks to show the benefits of treatment on molecular relapse in early-stage breast cancer. This is a randomized Phase 3 trial conducted across 120 sites in 12 countries led by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, otherwise known as EORTC. We also published a digital data in lung cancer, strengthening our leadership position in the patient population. In 2023 alone, we publicly presented the results for four key lung cancer cells across the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic treatment study and we've seen very strong performance. Two of these were conducted in collaboration with our partners at Foundation Medicine and demonstrated strong clinical test performance for immunotherapy monitoring. These studies helped to support the broad clinical launch and Medicare covers their FoundationOneTracker, which we also announced in October. As many of you know Tracker is a complimentary asset at Signatera with a focus on patients with advanced stage cancers. We're very excited about the launch and believe this new offering will help oncologists make the best possible decisions about the pace of care through actionable and personalized data. Great. So with that let's get into some of the business trends on the next slide. We saw continued strong growth in volumes across the major product areas as I described. In women's health, we had strong growth compared to Q3 of last year. The strong growth particularly given our ongoing efforts to reduce some volume from account where we don't see a path to stable reimbursement over time. In Organ Health we were pleased with the return to growth. As a reminder, earlier this year, reimbursement changes created some uncertainty for transplant centers about when they should order Vasistera. That uncertainty has now largely been resolved. And in Q3 we saw coming our larger customers recurring to prior levels. Both Organ Health and Women's Health represent large underserved base of population that have a critical need for the type of testing we offer. Solomon will cover the oncology volumes later in the call where the trends continue to be positive. On the next slide you can see that our revenue growth is getting a significant boost from improved reimbursement in addition to our volume growth. The left chart of total revenues, which grew 27% year-on-year, and I think that growth rate actually understates our good progress because we recorded a large one-time licensing payment in Q3 of last year. The product revenues on the right-hand side of the page we adjust for that. And as you can see product revenues were up 33% year-on-year. We made a decision last November to redouble our efforts on reimbursement and billing operations making sure that we navigate all the operational hurdles required to get reimbursement for covered service. For example, doing better on appeals when a service is denied or chasing down missing insurance information. Since then, we've made a significant investment in new processes. We've added new team members and we've identified systems and engineering opportunities. While we're still at the very early stages, it's great to see that we're starting to see these efforts come through in the financial results and there's still a long way to go. Of course, these improvements benefit both revenue growth and gross margins as you can see on the next slide. Gross margin dipped to 41% in Q4 of last year and then to 39% in Q1 of this year as we executed growth on the initiatives that we've described in the past. On the Q2 call, we described that gross margins were helped a bit by some one-time factors. In that time, we estimated the organic gross margin to be about 43% on a normalized basis. In Q3, our 45% gross margin is largely organic. We are seeing modest improvements in the NIPT and carrier ASPs and have outperformed our expectations in Signatera. For each of these products we have put in place multiple operational initiatives whose effects have not yet been fully recognized in revenue approval. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can deliver steady gains in the gross margins throughout the course of 2024. Another interesting byproduct of all this efforts is that our cap election cycle noticeably improved in Q3 compared to prior quarters, which helped drive the significant reduction in quarterly cash burn along with the revenue growth and gross margin improvement. Finally, we continue to hit our marks on cost of goods sold as we've expanded our Signatera, Exton laboratory and executed COGS projects across the company. We've got a full slate of these lab infrastructure projects and we expect to launch many of them during 2024. This has been a big area of investment within our R&D budget and it will be nice to see that investment pay off. In addition to the above cards project, we've also passed some key validation and regulatory milestones with an alternative NGF provider. We validated the Signatera technology on an alternative NGF platform and in partnership with a major pharmaceutical company achieve a regulatory milestone using that alternate platform. In addition, we validated NIPT on alternative NGF platform and past the regulatory milestones which we may now launch a version of in our centralized laboratory. All of these factors give us confidence that we are on track to get to a cash flow breakeven quarter next year. And with that, let me turn it over to Solomon, who will dive deeper on the results from RenaCARE in the Oncology business. Solomon? Yeah. I'll just add. This is Steve. We're off to I would say an incredibly strong start in Q4 and we're continuing to see I think acceleration in ASPs and in volumes. Yeah. Thanks a lot. So I guess first just on commercial payers and the biomarker bill, I think some of the other groups that have presented have talked quite a bit about that. We're, obviously, monitoring things. We're taking a little bit of a more cautious approach. We want to see how things actually come through. But the reality is the biomarker builds are in place now and passed in a significant number of very critical states. So we think that it could serve as an opportunity I think to quicken the traditional pace that you see for commercial coverage. And, obviously, with California passing that's resolved things with Blue Shield of California. But overall I would say this biomarker bill is a net positive. It's something that is unique for its time period and not an opportunity that's been available previously. So frankly this might end up being the quickest path to get commercial coverage versus what we've seen historically. From a Renasight standpoint, I think the RenaCARE study, we think is a real inflection point. We've already previously said about 40% of nephrologists have used the product, we've done tens of thousands of tests at this stage and the excitement from the nephrology community and the interest is incredible. I mean it's like something that I haven't experienced before where nephrologists are really welcoming this product in with open arms. They're very engaged they -- it's like they've been starving for a product like this. So, we're excited about that. With that said, any time you're introducing something new, it does take a while to get protocols in place and get that type of market penetration that could be impactful. When I think about the market size, I think a very direct comparison here can be made with hereditary cancer testing. There you have a very similar situation where you have the sort of incident and prevalent pools. And frankly, they're a similar size. And hereditary cancer testing today is an incredibly large opportunity. And so, we think we're laying the groundwork for something similar. Yes. I'll just add too. I think one of the things that is really exciting is as we're looking now at this very clear path to cash flow breakeven in 2024 and a very strong revenue growth ahead that we're not really incorporating any of the upside opportunity from guideline changes, things like in 22q, or any of the upside opportunity from biomarker legislation, which was just asked about a minute ago. So, the model that we're looking at really just includes sort of status quo and blocking and tackling and billing operations improvements, but all of those other things are really upside, potentially very significant upside that we just don't need to get to cash flow breakeven and have another good year. Yes. First, let me just talk about women's health. So, of course, we don't have any information on exactly what happened and so forth. But we do know that there was a guideline committee meeting, I think in September from ACOG. And if you start to think about just sort of the timeline that you might see the results from that, I think that could be in Q1. We don't know either way whether things will be positive or negative, but we feel really strong about the fundamentals behind 22q testing that are outlined in the SMART study and behind the fundamentals of expanded carrier screening. So, we'll just have to stay tuned and see what happens there. From the NCCN side of things, when you look at kind of the -- I think there was a meeting in August, we're expecting to kind of hear an outcome from that maybe later this year or early next year. We do know that the CIRCULATE 18-month data was included in the review because it was submitted in time. But of course we don't know the outcome. Now, the great thing for Natera is because we started working on randomized controlled trials in the escalation setting for example, ALTAIR, more than five years ago. In 2024, we will actually have the results -- initial results from ALTAIR reading out. So, regardless of what the guideline committee says this year with respect to the CIRCULATE study, next year the ALTAIR results will be out. And so it's just really a matter of time assuming the trial reads out positively and that's why we feel very positive about things. And when you look at what setting is ALTAIR. I think it has sort of two settings. One is treatment escalation. But then the other is a treatment on molecular recurrence components where patients from the VEGA study that are initially negative are being monitored with ctDNA. And when they screen positive, they flip over into the Altera Arm and are randomized at that time. And then are either treated or not treated. So we're excited about that treatment on molecular recurrence readout as well which we think -- I think is another reason why Surveillance Testing is important. So look forward to having both of those read out. Alex or Solomon, would you like to add anything else or? Yeah. Okay. Yes. So, this is Steve. I'll take that. So we've said before we have a case-controlled study that's coming out probably at the end of this year maybe in early January. And then we're following that up with an additional study looking at advanced cetinoma. And once we have both of those in hand we're going to sort of see how we measure up to others that are out there. And I think there's sort of two decision points there. There's -- how do we compare to the competition and where are we on our trajectory to cash flow breakeven and how do the financials look. And we're not going to do anything at all that's going to impact our ability to get to cash flow breakeven. So we think we're taking the right unmeasured approach and phase-gated approach where we're waiting to hit key milestones before we decide whether we're moving the ball forward or not. And if we do move the ball forward the -- I think, the next steps would really be in 2025 in 2026, where we'll be operating in a different environment where we think we'll be cash flow positive. Yes. Let me just talk quickly about guidelines and then I'll have Alex comment on the CIRCULATE data. So the -- why do you -- you need guidelines to grow volume and to get commercial reimbursement. And we're growing volume right now at a really fast pace. And we're also now seeing commercial reimbursement coming on, and because of the biomarker bill, we think that's going to continue. So at this point, it's -- I think guidelines obviously would quicken the pace of those things. But, we're going to get really far along here without guidelines coming in. And I think importantly for Natera, we don't need guidelines to achieve cash flow breakeven and continue to significantly grow the business. So we'll wait and see what happens -- but if we don't end up getting it this time around we have the ALTAIR study coming out and we'll be in a great position. So Alex, do you want to comment on the CIRCULATE data whether that's derisked ALTAIR Vega."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, August 3, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Michael Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter of 2023. On the line, I\u2019m joined by Steve Chapman, our CEO; Solomon Moshkevich, General Manager of Oncology; and Alex Aleshin, Chief Medical Officer. Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to the slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be posted to our IR site as soon as it\u2019s available. Starting on Slide 2. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our operational and financial outlook and projections. Our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various current and future products, including product capabilities, expected release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today\u2019s press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, August 3, 2023. If this call is replayed or reviewed later after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. We\u2019ll quote a number of numerical growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we had another very strong quarter. Volumes were up more than 23% versus Q2 of last year, with all products delivering strong growth. Revenues grew even faster, up 32% versus last year and 8% sequentially. We paired that revenue growth with continued COGS improvements to achieve a gross margin just above 45% compared to 39% in Q1. This, combined with stable operating expenses, led us to deliver another significant reduction in our quarterly cash burn. We were pleased to be significantly increasing the revenue guide this quarter to a midpoint of $1.025 billion, and we remain on track for our OpEx and cash burn reduction targets in the guide. We believe we are on track to hit all the financial goals we set for this year and beyond. We also continue to strengthen our leadership in data generation. In June, we attended the American Transplant Congress and unveiled key data from the ProActive trial, showing the value of our Prospera test in kidney transplant rejection. ProActive is proving to be a pivotal trial, and I\u2019ll share some of those findings here shortly. In women\u2019s health, we published the fourth paper from the SMART trial in the Journal Genetics in Medicine. This study was the largest prospective clinical validation of screening for sex chromosomal aneuploidies with NIPT. We were pleased to earn additional peer-reviewed recognition for SMART, further demonstrating the strength of our data and the clinical value of our Panorama test. In oncology, we crossed a key milestone in the quarter with the publication of more than 50 peer-reviewed papers. We also had a substantial presence at ASCO including readouts on key Signatera data in collaboration with some of the most well-respected healthcare institutions in the country. We shared excellent performance in the EMPower Lung trial demonstrating the utility of Signatera in lung cancer, where IO is the standard of care, which supports our on-market and reimbursed IO monitoring indication. And in CRC, we had key readouts from the GALAXY arm of CIRCULATE-Japan and the INTERCEPT trial from MD Anderson. Coupled with the completion of the enrollment in the ALTAIR trial, and several other prospective randomized studies underway, we continue building a robust platform to demonstrate the prognostic and predictive value of Signatera in CRC. Altogether, we think these trials continue to build a strong case for future NCCN guideline inclusion, which Solomon will cover later in the call. In terms of other key updates, we recently announced two very significant litigation results in our favor. First, a jury in Delaware reached a unanimous verdict in favor of Natera in the patent infringement lawsuit filed against ArcherDX and Invitae. The jury found that all of accused products, including personalized cancer monitoring used for MRD indication infringed three of our patents and that all three patents are valid. The jury also awarded a $19.35 million award in past damages including lost profits and a royalty of 10%. At a future date, a judge will determine whether to grant an injunction against ArcherDX and Invitae\u2019s personalized monitoring MRD test. If that is not granted, we will ask the judge to award ongoing royalties at a rate higher than 10%. And second, we also announced in July, a favorable decision in the false advertising case brought by a competitor. The court reversed findings returned by a jury in March of 2022 and overturned the previous damages award, thereby reducing it from $45 million down to $0 [ph]. Great. So with that, let\u2019s get into some of the business trends on the next slide. We had another strong volume quarter, growing more than 23% versus last year. This represents strong year-on-year growth across the business and another particularly strong Signatera quarter. We saw our typical trends in seasonality in process units in the women\u2019s health business, where Q1 is usually our biggest quarter and Q2 is slightly down. This trend was amplified this year because we made a concerted effort this spring to reduce volume from some of the larger accounts that we\u2019re not generating an adequate margin and didn\u2019t have a clear path to improvement. Given our scale, we think that\u2019s a sensible exercise, and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to improve women\u2019s health product margins in the second half of this year. Having said that, we are still committed to the initiatives we discussed earlier this year where we\u2019ve taken our lower margin volumes in exchange for future upside, which we\u2019ll touch on later. Overall, in volumes, we\u2019re in some very large markets that are underpenetrated, and we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for growth. particularly in Signatera given the huge market size in the very early stages of penetration. Speaking of Signatera, the next slide shows yet another very strong year-on-year volume trend, almost doubling in size once again. Compared to Q1, we saw an acceleration in absolute units and the growth engine really continues to be in clinical indications where we have Medicare reimbursement. That trend was also apparent in the Signatera clinical ASP, which were once again well ahead of the schedule. Recall the Signatera ASPs were in the $500 a couple of years ago and that progressed to the mid-700s in Q3 and Q4 of last year. We were very pleased to be in the low 800s in Q1, and now we\u2019ve progressed again into the mid-800s ASP range. At the same time, we\u2019ve made some meaningful COGS progress on our tissue exome workflow and reducing supplier costs in some places, which further pushed up our gross margin for this product. There\u2019s still more progress to be made, and Mike will get into some more details on the drivers of these trends later in the call. The volume, ASP and COGS achievements helped to drive our revenue and margin outperformance in the quarter. I\u2019ll touch first on revenue on the next slide, which highlights our sequential revenue trends over the last five quarters. I highlighted the sequential trend from Q1 to Q2 of last year compared to this year. As you can see, we saw an acceleration of revenue growth between Q1 and Q2 of this year despite the disruption in the transplant business that we noted on the last call. The revenue growth was driven by Signatera clinical, pharma and women\u2019s health, which Mike will discuss shortly in the call. Finally, on gross margins. This quarter, we had an excellent margin of 45%. This was amplified a bit with some onetime events. So on a normalized basis, we think margins would have been around 43% in Q2. This is a big step up from our 39% in Q1, and Mike will go over a few of the sustainable areas that led to our significant margin improvement later in the call. Our strong execution enabled us to overcome the negative impact that some of the bets we made where we took on lower margin volume in exchange for future opportunity. We believe these bets are on track. First, the California prenatal screening program volume is now largely shifted back to Panorama versus Vasistera, which has helped us on both margin and revenue. Second, we still believe there\u2019s upside opportunity on expanded carrier screening as coverage improves in the future. And finally, of course, we believe in growing Signatera, despite it dragging down the margin. As Signatera margins improve, which they have been, the margin drag impact will reverse. While these still have room for upside with our strong COGS and ASP execution, we feel very good about continuing to deliver our strong gross margins around the middle of our guide range for the rest of the year. Okay, now let\u2019s move on to women\u2019s health. We now have more than 80 peer-reviewed publications in our women\u2019s health business. As a reminder, one of those, the SMART study is the largest prospective NIPT study ever performed with greater than 20,000 patients enrolled across 21 global centers. All Panorama NIPT results included in the analysis were confirmed with molecular diagnosis as clinical truth. As I mentioned, the recent Genetics in Medicine paper is the fourth from the SMART study was published officially in May. This real world data confirmed Panorama\u2019s excellent performance when screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies across over 17,000 pregnancies, and all screening results were validated with clinical outcomes. This is the largest prospective clinical validation study of NIPT for sex chromosome aneuploidies. In addition to this latest publication on sex chromosome aneuploidies, we also studied the performance of Panorama to detect common aneuploidies such as Trisomy 21. Our results showed a very high sensitivity and specificity resulting in a 95% positive predicted value for Trisomy 21, which is very strong. One of the most significant aspects of the SMART study are the results on 22q. The 22q results demonstrated a high prevalence for 22q of approximately one in 1,500, a high sensitivity and a low false positive rate of 0.05% resulting in a positive predicted value of 53% or approximately one in two. This PPV is excellent and as a comparison, it\u2019s more than 10 times the positive predicted value of maternal serum screening of Trisomy 21, which is an approach ACOG still endorses. We feel the data supporting the performance in clinical utility of 22q screening is very strong. Shifting gears to carrier screening also in Q2, the FDA approved the first gene therapy for pediatric patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who have a confirmed genetic mutation in the gene. DMD affects roughly one in 3,500 boys causing progressive muscle weakness, heart issues, and breathing difficulties. One of the most important benefits of carrier screening is early diagnosis for conditions like DMV, so that families and doctors can prepare for and have the earliest possible access to treatments like the one that just got approved. Our Horizon carrier screen includes the option to screen for DMD along with many other conditions with treatments that are either FDA approved or currently in trials. So we think this strengthens the case for broad panel carrier screening where we think the clinical utility is strong with a positive ACMG guidelines supporting expanded carrier screening 2021 and a positive statement from the National Society of Genetic Counselors earlier this year. We are hopeful that these and other changes can allow us to help more patients and pave the way for improvements in reimbursement rates moving into next year. As many of you know, ACOG held their annual meeting in May, which led to the scheduling of two prenatal committee working groups, one in June and one scheduled for September. Based on that timing, we anticipate having more information later this fall on any changes to future guidelines. Okay, moving on to Oregon Health. Earlier in the year, we discussed the negative impact of the recent Medicare change and the change is now fully reflected in our guidance. As we said before, the impact was offset somewhat with our receiving heart reimbursement, and now that we\u2019ve seen some of the lost kidney volumes come back as well, we think we\u2019ve come out the other side well positioned. In addition, we\u2019ve taken steps to realign the Oregon Health business where we are now in a position to drive volume and revenue growth while keeping our expenses stable. I wanted to start with a few key stats on clinical adoption and volume growth. On Renasight, which is our test for chronic kidney disease, we\u2019ve continued to demonstrate strong clinical utility, including data that was presented at the National Kidney Foundation Conference in April. We\u2019re looking forward to the publication of RenaCARE study, which we think can provide strong support going forward. In heart and lung, we\u2019ve continued to have productive dialogue with our customers, including at the recent Annual Meeting of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. Thus far in 2023, 50% of the top 20 transplant centers have used Prospera Heart and 50% of the top 20 transplant centers have used Prospera Lung. In addition, the number of active users of Prospera Heart has nearly doubled in the past 12 months where the test volume has more than doubled. Of course, we were pleased to receive Medicare coverage and heart transplantation earlier this year, which provided some nice upside on reimbursement. We also look forward to the Prospera Heart data we expect will publish later this year from the prospective DTRT study sponsored by the NIH. In early June, we had a strong presence at the American Transplant Congress meeting showcasing the utility of Prospera and kidney and heart transplantation. This included three oral presentations and several posters in a symposium led by medical experts in the field. I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on the ProActive data that was featured. As a reminder, ProActive is a large prospective multi-site donor-derived cell-free DNA study in kidney transplant patients. The study has enrolled renal transplant patients from 54 participating centers that are being followed over three years. At ATC, we outlined several highlights from the interim analysis of the first 1,600 patients with 18 months of follow-up data. Importantly, the data demonstrates that Prospera Kidney is a leading indicator of rejection, predicting antibody mediated rejection up to four months, and T-cell mediated rejection up to two months in advance of biopsy. This evidence is impressive and highlights the value of Prospera as a tool for rejection that can provide early insight to graft health when used as an ongoing monitoring tool. This ProActive data bolsters recent sentiments from leading medical societies and organizations like the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the European Society of Transplantation who have endorsed the use of donor derived cell-free DNA surveillance to rule out subclinical rejection. We look forward to publishing data from the ProActive study as early as the end of this year in sharing additional readouts in the future that we believe will help transform the current standard of care for kidney transplant patients. We think the evidence will help bolster the case for coverage of Prospera in the surveillance setting in the future. Now, I\u2019d like to hand the call over to Solomon to cover our recent progress in oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. The oncology team had a great quarter with strong growth in test volumes and ASP improvements in our turnaround times, the publication of several new peer-reviewed papers and strong showing at ASCO with over a dozen posters of presentations. We were highly energized by the feedback at ASCO, particularly from clinicians who believe that now is the time to be implementing MRD assessment into routine clinical practice. This was a sentiment we heard a number of times during the conference, and we are seeing it reflected now in the volume growth as well. Let\u2019s take a deeper look now at two key studies from ASCO. The first one I\u2019ll cover is the EMPOWER-Lung 1 trial. This was a Phase 3 registrational trial sponsored by Regeneron, which helped to support FDA approval in 2021 of their immunotherapy agent cemiplimab for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Using banked samples from that trial, Natera measured ctDNA at three different time points, pre-treatment, week three of treatment, and week nine of treatment. The analysis validated the predictive nature of ctDNA dynamics in lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Specifically, patients with an early increase in ctDNA had the highest risk of death and patients who achieved ctDNA clearance or a deep production of at least 90% had significantly improved outcomes. This study was well received as it was a focused assessment of IO monitoring, specifically in advanced lung cancer, and one of the largest data sets of its kind with 175 patients. With Medicare coverage already in place for IO monitoring across solid tumors including in lung cancer, we believe this data can help support broader adoption and perhaps broader reimbursement. As a reminder, non-small cell lung cancer is the largest patient population where immunotherapy is currently utilized with we believe upwards of 150,000 patients now eligible per year. The second study from ASCO we want to highlight is the INTERCEPT Study. INTERCEPT is an independent program of the MD Anderson Cancer Center, which integrates MRD assessment into routine clinical practice for all patients with resected Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 4 colorectal cancer, and if funnels patients into clinical trials if they test positive in the surveillance setting without radiologic evidence of disease. In this report at ASCO, the group shared analysis from over a thousand patients demonstrating the feasibility and utility of routine surveillance with Signatera. The two key findings were first of the patients with ctDNA detected during surveillance. Nearly half or 49% were found to have radiologic evidence of disease, though in many cases the diagnosis required reflex imaging with MRI, PET CT or biopsy, not just a standard surveillance scan. This created the opportunity for early intervention into metastatic disease before it became symptomatic, which is known to improve outcomes in CRC. Second of the ctDNA positive patients who were without radiologic evidence of disease, 59% were successfully enrolled into ctDNA guided clinical trials, gaining access to novel cellular therapies, cancer vaccines, and other novel treatments. This report is making waves in the GI community because it helps answer some key outstanding questions. Is there utility in ctDNA-based recurrence monitoring and what does one do with a positive result? This study indicates strong clinical utility enabling early therapeutic interventions for patients with metastatic disease, as well as enrollment into clinical trials, and it sets an example for the whole community in how to successfully adopt Signatera into routine practice. In the surveillance setting, we look forward to more data and insights from the INTERCEPT program in the future and to other leading cancer centers being inspired to replicate this model. Also in CRC, we completed enrollment in June for the ALTAIR trial. As a reminder, ALTAIR is part of the CIRCULATE-Japan platform, which includes three prospective arms as shown on this slide. First, the observational GALAXY study plus two randomized Phase 3 studies ALTAIR for treatment escalation in the MRD positive population and VEGA for de-escalation in the MRD-negative population. With ALTAIR, we aim to establish the utility of extended adjuvant treatment as well as treatment on molecular recurrence in MRD-positive patients. We know there is a significant percentage of MRD-positive patients who will not respond to standard adjuvant chemotherapy and who we believe may benefit from a drug called TAS-102. Given that TAS-102 is already approved for use in the metastatic setting when chemotherapy has failed. In the trial MRD-positive patients or randomized to receive TAS-102 or placebo after completing standard chemotherapy, it's important to note that for anyone who was initially MRD-negative and who entered the VEGA trial, if follow on Signatera testing changes to ctDNA positive within two years, they can switch out of VEGA and get randomized into the treatment arm in ALTAIR. This may definitively show the benefit of treatment on molecular recurrence for CRC patients that are being surveilled with Signatera. We believe this trial will demonstrate how Signatera can improve outcomes for CRC patients with detectable ctDNA before it becomes evident on imaging. We expect primary results on ALTAIR to be available mid next year, and given the randomized nature of the study, we believe a successful outcome can be definitive and practice changing. ALTAIR and INTERCEPT should be considered in the context of Natera's broader clinical roadmap in CRC one of our most important areas of investment. With the GALAXY study, we look forward to presenting updated data in an oral presentation at the ESMO Conference this October, now with disease-free survival data up to 24-months, and we are submitting our published data for review by the NCCN Committee. The work on these studies has been underway for many years with multiple readouts expected between now and 2026. We expect the results will continue to demonstrate both the prognostic and predictive value of Signatera and given the scale and quality of these studies, including upwards of 15,000 CRC patients across different settings of care, we think this pipeline creates a significant competitive advantage. We plan to follow the same playbook and multiple other disease indications, particularly in breast cancer. Our first study in breast cancer was the Coombes paper published in 2019, which helped us secure Medicare coverage for Signatera uniquely across all subtypes of the disease to achieve adoption. However, into practice guidelines and broader reimbursement from private payers, we believe we need to generate more evidence including additional high quality biobank studies as well as randomized clinical trials. For example, we have spoken before about the EBLISS [ph] expansion cohort. This will have three times more patients and five times more plasma time points than what was previously published with significantly longer follow-up beyond five years. We presented the results at ASCO in 2022 and looked forward to the publication of this expanded cohort. In addition, earlier this year, we published new data from the I-SPY 2 trial, which examined patients in the neoadjuvant setting before surgery. We're now building on our partnership with the I-SPY 2 trial consortium, integrating the testing prospectively into their platform. The use of neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer is growing in popularity, and there are several unmet clinical needs where we think Signatera can help. For example, can certain patients shorten the duration or skip chemotherapy altogether and proceed faster to surgery? Conversely, if a patient has rising levels of ctDNA, should they switch earlier to a different type of therapy? Across all of these settings, neoadjuvant, adjuvant and surveillance, we have multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in the pipeline across all subtypes of disease, but with extra emphasis in HR-positive HER2-negative disease. Given the size of that population, the only studies that have been announced to date are DARE and LEADER, which are ongoing, and which as a reminder are Phase 2 studies that monitor HR-positive HER2-negative patients in the surveillance setting and offer treatment on molecular recurrence. This clinical pipeline gives us multiple shots on goal in breast cancer and with co-sponsorship from our pharma and academic partners, the investments are efficient enough to work within our financial goals. We look forward to announcing more details in the future about all of these studies on this page. In summary, we believe the quality of our clinical data, the breadth of our Medicare coverage, the volume and speed of test adoption and the strength of our research partnerships will allow us to continue extending our first mover advantage in breast cancer. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Brophy to discuss our financial results and outlook. Mike.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Solomon. Okay, the next slide is just the standard results slide. These covered the volume and revenue trends and how we're seeing strong momentum in each. Revenues were up significantly with the majority of the outperformance driven by growth in Signatera clinical and also pharma. We also saw women's health revenues come in ahead of expectations, and that benefited in the quarter from a surge in carrier screening volumes we received late in Q1 and resulted out early in Q2, so we had those units in our Q1 test process number, but they were accrued as revenues in cause [ph] when we read the results out to patients results early in Q2, I'd estimate that to be about a $4 million revenue benefit in the quarter. Steve noted the excellent gross margin performance, and while we did have some one-time benefits in the quarter, we also saw substantial organic margin growth driven by COGS improvements, vendor renegotiations, continued Signatera ASP traction that we think can be sustainable and a shift in the Signatera mix to more recurrent monitoring units. It's also worth recalling that we've intentionally penalized gross margins this year to pursue three core volume-based initiatives that Steve described earlier. We've benefited from volume mix shifting back to Panorama in California, but the other initiatives are not fully realized yet, so getting into the mid 40s gross margin at this early stage, I think is a very encouraging sign. Total OpEx was down slightly in the quarter compared to Q1, and the balance sheet remains very strong as we can see on the slide. All those trends contributed to another significant reduction in our quarterly cash burn, as you can see on the next slide. As Steve mentioned, we believe we are on track to reduce our annual cash burn this year by roughly $150 million. As we've discussed in the past, we're driving these cash burn reductions as we get operating leverage of the commercial infrastructure we built up most recently in the oncology space. We continue to make significant investments in our COGS reduction activities, including switching our core women's health products to more efficient sequencers and driving additional savings from improvements to our Signatera and carrier screening workflows. We saw another modest sequentially quarterly reduction in our DSOs versus Q1 as we continue to get more efficient in our revenue cycle operations, particularly for Signatera. I've described in the past how cash burn and DSOs can vary quarter-to-quarter, but we have seen a linear improvement in these last four quarters, so I think that's good evidence that we are on track to reach cash flow break even in a quarter in 2024. Based on the volume ASP expense trends we're expecting. As we said before, that forecast leaves aside any significant investment in early cancer screening. We remain on track to deliver preliminary data early next year. We'll share that data with you before we make decisions on further investments. Okay, good. Let's move on to our revised guidance on the next slide. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to once again be raising the revenue guide for the year driven by stronger volumes and Signatera ASPs. Previously, the guide was $995 million to $1.015 billion and we're now completely resetting the range so that the previous top end is now the bottom end of our guide range. Given the significant step up in Q2 revenue plus the one-time impact described above, I think the pacing for the year implies a stable Q3 with a larger step up in Q4 revenue. I think the gross margin results this quarter highlights that while gross margins will bounce around quarter-to-quarter, we think this range is clearly achievable on a full year measurement. We're also modestly bumping up SG&A for the year to account, in part for some non-cash expenses incurred in the first half of this year, but total SG&A is still expected to be down versus 2022, and so accordingly, the cash burn guide remains intact, and we feel good about reaching our targets there, as Steve and I discussed. So with that, let me hand a call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys, good evening, and thanks for the time here. Steve, I want to start with the, the reproductive health business and gross margins. You talked about, California volume largely having migrated over to Panorama now and also the exit of certain accounts where there wasn't enough margin upside. So, in light of that dynamic, why wouldn't sort of 45% sort of be the floor for gross margins for the rest of the year? And does that sort of number contemplate the impact of bringing in exome sequencing in-house for Signatera as well?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, so I guess first I'll say, we did benefit, from both of those, on a certain basis. But, I think as Mike mentioned in the gross margin, there were some onetime events, that I think accounted for, something like 250 basis points, that I think hit us in Q2, but won't necessarily be there in Q3. So we do expect, margin improvement as the years go on. But I think, Mike, you might be better to kind of get into the details on this. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, so in addition to the California initiative pages, there was there's two other big initiatives, right? One is, the growth in extended care screening volume that we described in the past couple quarters, and that that's been really, we've had a had a big step up in volumes there and then also the strategy to continue to grow Signatera, and while the gross margin there is currently improving, it's still, still dilutive to the kind of the corporate gross margin. So those two tend to have, what we think is a, as a temporary drag on gross margins. Now, we did some cost cutting beginning of the year to kind of make you net neutral on the EBIT line for that. But those are still kind of temporary drags on gross margin, but both, I think are pretty bullish signs for the future. So that's, one out of three so far and we're making good progress on the other two obviously.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And a quick follow up on Signatera, I think Steve; you talked about sort over 30% of U.S. oncologists ordering Signatera, now. Can you share what proportion of those accounts are still exclusively using Signatera for MRD and where, physicians are sort of dabbling across other providers as well? I mean is there evidence for sort of that sustainable first mover advantage is essentially sort of staying intact for you particularly, as other sort of competitors make a concerted push and does that some of the litigation that you guys mentioned here potentially delay sort of competitor entry into that market?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that's a great question. So we've seen continued growth in the number of accounts that are using us and particularly in the accounts that are using Natera in a sort of sustainable way. Our account retention rates have been very high, and I think that has to do with sort of the stickiness of the product. I mean once you do whole exome sequencing and set up a patient for MRD, it's not going to make sense to go back and sort of redo the exome sequencing on that patient and set them up again for MRD testing. So I think we really haven't seen any of the tumor-informed MRD companies out in the marketplace, if they have, it's been on like an extremely limited basis. I think, of course, Guardant and the Reveal products are out there, we see them from time to time. We do know there are some accounts that sort of use both products, but there's always going to be competition. And I think this is a very large market. And we think particularly in this setting, because of the stickiness dynamic that I described and because of the extensive leads that we have in peer-reviewed publications and coverage and just setting up our infrastructure, that the first-mover advantage is going to be incredibly important here. From the IP standpoint, as we've said before, we have a very strong portfolio of intellectual property related to cell-free DNA particularly in the field of oncology. And you're seeing, I think, the first of those wins now with the suit that we described \u2013 the win that we described. And I think there's other ongoing suits. If someone's infringing on our IP, we intend to defend ourselves.\nTejas Savant: Very helpful. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time. \nOperator: Next question from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Please go ahead. \nCatherine Schulte: Hi guys. Thanks for the questions. I guess first, just blended ASP took a pretty big jump up in the quarter, even if I back out the $4 million benefit that Mike called out. I know Steve already talked about Signatera ASPs. But could you just talk to the ASP trends within your women's health business in the quarter?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. First, I'll make a couple of comments, and then maybe, Mike, you can kind of get into the details. And so I think there's opportunities that we've talked about before on improving ASP that come from just sort of turning the crank on some of the billing operations things and improving our processes and protocols. And obviously, we're working on those. In addition, we're also seeing, I think, the kind of first beginnings of some good coverage for expanded carrier screening. I think that's still very early and there's still a lot of opportunity there to improve the ASP, but certainly, there's some upside. Mike, do you want to talk about any of the specifics?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. I mean, I think in addition to the drivers that you mentioned, the Signatera ASPs were up again [indiscernible] up again in the quarter. And we had a modestly stronger kind of pharma contribution this quarter, which if you're kind of measuring this on a total revenue basis. We tend to amplify ASPs. I think in terms of like on a per unit kind of revenue divided by test reported basis, I do feel like the step-ups we've seen here look sustainable to us. These are fairly organic moves other than the one kind of timing benefit we got on carrier screening. We feel really good about kind of the organic drivers for Signatera clinical ASP, for example. So really pleased with the results.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. Great. And then the FDA is expected to put out a proposed rule on LDT regulation this month. Have you guys had any conversation with the FDA around that potential and any other thoughts you have there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I mean the way that we've kind of set this up is we've tried to thoroughly validate all of our tests and deliver very high-quality peer-reviewed publications. And in the event that there is some change from a regulatory standpoint, we think we're very well positioned there. We're obviously in touch with various agencies and governing bodies and doing, I think, what we can to try to stay informed on what's happening to make sure that we're prepared. But the key is you have to have very thoroughly validated products an extensive peer-reviewed publications, and we have that. And that puts us in a great position should the guidelines change in anyway.\nCatherine Schulte: All right. Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Next question from Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Please go ahead Rachel.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you. So first up on women\u2019s health, you mentioned that ACOG had prenatal meeting scheduled for June and September, I believe expanded carrier screening and microdeletions were on the agenda for that June meeting. So can you tell us if you have any information regarding how that meeting went? And then when \u2013 how quickly could we see ACOG endorse 22q, could it come right after the September meeting or just updated time line expectations there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I mean, look, we really don\u2019t get any information with respect to kind of what happens in these various meetings or even details, all the topics and things. So, I think, we just kind of take a step back and look at kind of the trends that are happening from a bigger picture. What are the topics that ACOG might be interested in? And I think, certainly 22q given the SMART study and expanded carrier screening given that significant portion of the community is now doing expanded carrier screening or topics that I think would be of interest. What we focus on is publishing data like we did in the SMART study, largest prospective trial that\u2019s ever been done in NIPT, excellent performance specs for 22q, both on disease incidence, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value. And we think it meets all of the criteria that one would need to issue coverage. But again, we don\u2019t really know exactly what\u2019s happening. We just see that the meetings are occurring and hoping that they\u2019re discussing. If they do put out a guideline, I would imagine that we would find out more information kind of late fall on the status and what the funnel timing is going to be.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then a follow-up here, just shifting over to oncology. Can you give us an update on your latest conversations with private payers? I understand you have Blue Cross Blue Shield of California on that pan-cancer assay, which is a positive. But how are those conversations evolving, especially ahead of some potential updates from the NCCN guidelines? And then also, I know that American Cancer Society is still trying to push in a lot that commercial payers should offer the same Medicare testing. So can you just walk us through your latest expectations there? Really, what could that mean for the Signatera business? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So American cancer study has really been leading the charge in a very bipartisan way on their biomarker bill. And from what we understand, it\u2019s going well. I think they now have 10-plus states that have adopted it into law. I think from our side, it\u2019s still early. Once the bill goes into place, then you have to see if they\u2019re going to pay and kind of what the hoops are that you have to jump over. But it\u2019s certainly creating discussions with payers, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some additional commercial coverage come in from other regional plans, maybe national plans in the near future.\nOperator: Next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet, please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. This one is more broadly for oncology. I mean you had CRC first and then the adjuvant settings and then you had IO indication also now you have breast. Maybe can you talk about the sort of the trajectory for indications? And when do you think we can get a pan-cancer indication here? As you know, that happened in CGP as well. It took some time. You obviously have been leading this market for some time. And so I just want to get a sense of when do you think you can \u2013 we can reach that? And if there are Solomon and Alex on the line, would love their thoughts, too.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Solomon, why don\u2019t you take that one?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Happy to. Hey, Puneet. So yes, we\u2019ve \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve enjoyed some good success with Medicare thus far. And we have multiple additional submissions that are planned for this year, one under review right now. I think you can look at the data that we\u2019ve generated and see where the validity is shaping up to support coverage decisions. We\u2019ve discussed before. We think we have strong data in gastro and esophageal cancers in melanoma and looking forward to generating and publishing that data in pancreatic and lung and recently a paper in Merkel cell carcinoma. So I think there\u2019s a very nice pipeline shaping up. Keep in mind that I think that\u2019s \u2013 each one of those is going to add a smaller and smaller percentage of the patient population that we test as well. So the coverages we\u2019ve gotten thus far have been super important, especially with breast cancer coming in uniquely across all subtypes. To your question about pan-cancer coverage, at this point, we are really planning for generating the relevant data indication by indication. And if we see an opportunity to make that inflection we\u2019re definitely going to do that. But we know how the NCCN guidelines committees operate as well. They\u2019re also structured and organized by indication. And so we think the smart thing to do is just continue generating great evidence.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That\u2019s super. And then maybe for Mike, or Steve, as you look at the carrier testing business, obviously, you had one of the competitors that exited and you have benefited from the volume. I just wanted to get a sense of sort of majority of the volume migrated at this point? Or do you expect to continue to see benefit there in the rest half of the year? Thanks.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I think \u2013 sorry, Mike, go ahead. Yes, I was just going to tell on the volume standpoint, I think that the volume kind of shifted over in sort of late Q4 and Q1. But go ahead, Mike, if you want to comment further.\nMichael Brophy: Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly what I was going to say. I think you had kind of a bolus kind of shift over Q4, Q1. I think you do have some \u2013 you got some seasonality here in Q2. And I expect to see some \u2013 just continued growth in that business in Q3 and beyond, particularly in Q4 as per our normal pattern.\nPuneet Souda: Great. And then do you expect any ASP improvements there too on ECS side?\nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes, sure. So just on the carrier ASPs, I mean, the guide actually implies kind of a modest erosion and the carrier screening ASP is consistent with what we talked about on the prior people in the Q4 and the Q1 call, and that\u2019s really just out of kind of conservatism from our perspective and just, I think, a prudent way for us to plan the business. I think what we\u2019re looking for there to get sustainably higher ASPs than the care screening business is to get that guideline that Steve was referencing earlier, until then, we\u2019re kind of in a holding matter and hoping to see that improve over the next few quarters.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Next, Matthew Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is Prashant [ph] on for Matt. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. Given the Dobbs versus Jackson Supreme Court ruling enacted in Mississippi in June of last year, how do you see that impacting your women\u2019s health segment test volumes, if at all?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I mean there\u2019s been various Supreme Court rulings that have come out. And I think we haven\u2019t seen any impacts in the areas where those have come out. I appreciate the question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then what is the current mix shift of private practices and hospital systems using NIPT versus maternal serum screening? And how do you see this evolving over the next six months to 12 months?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. We think NIPT is around 50% penetrated now overall. So obviously, there\u2019s still a lot of room for growth there. There\u2019s a certain portion of patients that never get screening. And so they\u2019re not going to be eligible. So you\u2019re never going to get to 100% penetration. But we\u2019ve said over the next two years to three years that this can get up to kind of 80%, 85% penetration, something in that range. And we do think there\u2019s continued shift away from maternal serum screening toward NIPT.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next question is from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead Dan.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Maybe just one on the guidance. I think on gross margin, Steve, I think you mentioned kind of middle of the range is kind of fair for the second half. So should that be the base case in terms of gross margins and maybe if you can walk through the puts and takes around that? And then just on revenues, really strong quarter, and it looks like you raised the midpoint by about $20 million, just \u2013 which is about the level of the beat versus consensus. So is that kind of conservatism? And maybe how should we think about Signatera and women\u2019s health kind of in the back half of the year?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Mike, why don\u2019t you talk a little about the margin consensus and sort of revenue guide. And then I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on just COGS and ASP overall that I think can help improve the margin, but go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Yes, I mean, I think, our approach to guidance remains the same as it\u2019s been the last eight years, which is we try and both guide and forecast the business with what we hope becomes a measure of conservatism. So I think what there\u2019s certainly upside to the guide that we put out here, and we\u2019ve talked about some of the potential drivers of the upside on the call, and Steve can list a few more when he gives some details. But that\u2019s kind of standard playbook for us on the revenue guide. I think this year that also really applies to the gross margin guide. Gross margins of this business as you guys know, those of you who have followed those story for a long time know that gross margins can bounce around paramount quarter-to-quarter. And you\u2019re certainly seeing that here in the first half. But I do feel like the range we\u2019ve given now is a safe range for us to get through when measured on a full year. I\u2019d expect that to be kind of as you exit this year and going into next, I feel like several of these drivers are going to continue to push that gross margin up. So I\u2019ll pause there. Steve, did you want to add some more color or detail?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I just wanted to kind of jump off on some of the longer-term opportunities as well. I mean, look, we said 45% gross margin this quarter with a couple of those percentage points from one-time events. So kind of net at around 43% sustainable. Now, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to increase that as we go forward. I mean, there\u2019s significant COGS reduction projects that we\u2019re working on right now. So moving to higher throughput sequencing instruments, we\u2019re at the tail end of finishing some of those projects. We\u2019ve identified three \u2013 potentially four logistics based COGS improvement projects that we can, we think we can save $10 million plus maybe $20 million on the COGS line as we move to implement those. And then there\u2019s still room to run to bring additional tissue sequencing in-house and negotiate certain aspects of the business with suppliers at a deeper level. And then lastly on Signatera, as more and more and more volume moves to the recurrence monitoring setting, which is the shift that we see occurring as the business gets bigger, of course, more people are staying on the test and they\u2019re moving, shifting to gross margin, the COGS go down, so that improves the gross margin. And then on the other side of things, you\u2019ve got ASP improvement opportunities. And so we have just turning the crank on billing operations and just getting better. And I think that is going to help in the future, and we haven\u2019t really seen the impact to that yet. But there\u2019s been a lot of work that\u2019s done there. And then we have getting paid for a higher percentage of the tests that we perform, of course, in Signatera every time we get one of these commercial policies, every time we get a new Medicare policy that helps with expanded carrier screening as payers come on and start paying or as guidelines come out that helps. There\u2019s things like 22q if that does come into guidelines that could make a significant impact. So the range that we\u2019re in right now while we\u2019re seeing improvements and we \u2013 it\u2019s sustainable, we\u2019ll see continued improvements. There\u2019s a lot that we can do that we are doing over time that are going to put us in really very strong position in the future.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you for that. I know NCCN is not included in your guidance, obviously, and you\u2019ve talked about being an upside driver, but just kind of remind us in terms of like, timing and when we\u2019d hear on this and kind of how you guys are feeling about it right now? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I\u2019ll make a couple comments and then maybe Solomon. So I think this is really the first year that we have a shot at NCCN guidelines because I think we were very kind of clear leading in last year that, hey, if the Galaxy paper\u2019s not published, it\u2019s not going to be considered. And in fact, it wasn\u2019t considered in the vote. So this is really the first year with Galaxy being published that we have a chance to be considered in the vote. There\u2019s different levels of guideline and kind of what we\u2019ve said is, we think we can be potentially included as a footnote which would be where they list out the major prognostic factors for colorectal cancer. And so I think getting in there as a footnote where Signatera is listed that would be a win. And then, maybe down the road being listed in the official algorithm recommendation table. Now, they\u2019ve also kind of highlighted a couple things where they said, hey, these are areas where we\u2019d like to see the additional data. One was randomized trials, and Solomon just described the ALTAIR study. I mean, it\u2019s incredible that we have completed enrollment on a large scale prospective randomized study looking at extended adjuvant treatment and escalation for MRD positive patients and treatment on molecular recurrence for patients that start off negative and become positive on surveillance. So the fact that the randomized trial is done enrolling is an enormous step forward, and we plan on reading that data out next summer. The other area where they said, they wanted to see data was on the clinical value of surveillance. And the great news is the INTERCEPT study, which we weren\u2019t even involved in, we just ran the testing for MD Anderson showed two very significant paths for clinical utility for patients that are positive with surveillance. So we think both of those are very good signs. And then, it\u2019s also you have to think beyond CRC as well. I think, there\u2019s other products and other indications where we have good data and course we\u2019re kind of looking at opportunities there as well.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Westenberg from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, David.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. I got two questions. I\u2019ll just ask them both up front. In terms of your progress in carrier, has it been renegotiation of expanded carrier or has it been a little bit more conversion of carrier to maybe the more basic panel? And then just on my \u2013 actually I\u2019ll pause and I\u2019ll ask the second one.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I would say, initially what happened when one of our competitors, I think closed up shop we saw big influx of very low margin business coming in. And we kind of swallowed that in Q4 and then in Q1. And what\u2019s happened since then is that we \u2013 there\u2019s been a \u2013 there\u2019s been some payers that have revised their policies and started paying in addition to I think us improving the sort of operations and appeals with some of the other payers that maybe already had a policy in place or that would consider paying on a case-by-case basis. So we have seen, I think we\u2019re at the very early stages of kind of turning the ship here and obviously getting a new guideline in place from ACOG I think is going to help. The existing policy from ACOG is helpful and that\u2019s why we have seen payers change guidelines. But if something more definitive came out, obviously that would kind of be the tipping point. There are some customers as well where we\u2019ve kind of said, hey, look, certain payers may not cover this test, and then we kind of reeducate them on what might be covered. And in some cases they make a decision that they want to order a smaller panel.\nDavid Westenberg: Got it. Very appreciated. One last question here. I didn\u2019t see where you recognize the 19 million legal payment in the quarter. So I was just wondering if is that going to show up when you publish cash flow statement where it shows up? And congrats on a great quarter. Thank you.\nMichael Brophy: Yes, it\u2019s not going to show up yet. It\u2019s not a cash payment. It\u2019s a judgment. And so there\u2019s a few more steps to go there as Steve described. So right now it\u2019s a judgment, but it\u2019s not something that is accrued for in the financial statements.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. The oncology team had a great quarter with strong growth in test volumes and ASP improvements in our turnaround times, the publication of several new peer-reviewed papers and strong showing at ASCO with over a dozen posters of presentations. We were highly energized by the feedback at ASCO, particularly from clinicians who believe that now is the time to be implementing MRD assessment into routine clinical practice. This was a sentiment we heard a number of times during the conference, and we are seeing it reflected now in the volume growth as well. Let's take a deeper look now at two key studies from ASCO. The first one I'll cover is the EMPOWER-Lung 1 trial. This was a Phase 3 registrational trial sponsored by Regeneron, which helped to support FDA approval in 2021 of their immunotherapy agent cemiplimab for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Using banked samples from that trial, Natera measured ctDNA at three different time points, pre-treatment, week three of treatment, and week nine of treatment. The analysis validated the predictive nature of ctDNA dynamics in lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Specifically, patients with an early increase in ctDNA had the highest risk of death and patients who achieved ctDNA clearance or a deep production of at least 90% had significantly improved outcomes. This study was well received as it was a focused assessment of IO monitoring, specifically in advanced lung cancer, and one of the largest data sets of its kind with 175 patients. With Medicare coverage already in place for IO monitoring across solid tumors including in lung cancer, we believe this data can help support broader adoption and perhaps broader reimbursement. As a reminder, non-small cell lung cancer is the largest patient population where immunotherapy is currently utilized with we believe upwards of 150,000 patients now eligible per year. The second study from ASCO we want to highlight is the INTERCEPT Study. INTERCEPT is an independent program of the MD Anderson Cancer Center, which integrates MRD assessment into routine clinical practice for all patients with resected Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 4 colorectal cancer, and if funnels patients into clinical trials if they test positive in the surveillance setting without radiologic evidence of disease. In this report at ASCO, the group shared analysis from over a thousand patients demonstrating the feasibility and utility of routine surveillance with Signatera. The two key findings were first of the patients with ctDNA detected during surveillance. Nearly half or 49% were found to have radiologic evidence of disease, though in many cases the diagnosis required reflex imaging with MRI, PET CT or biopsy, not just a standard surveillance scan. This created the opportunity for early intervention into metastatic disease before it became symptomatic, which is known to improve outcomes in CRC. Second of the ctDNA positive patients who were without radiologic evidence of disease, 59% were successfully enrolled into ctDNA guided clinical trials, gaining access to novel cellular therapies, cancer vaccines, and other novel treatments. This report is making waves in the GI community because it helps answer some key outstanding questions. Is there utility in ctDNA-based recurrence monitoring and what does one do with a positive result? This study indicates strong clinical utility enabling early therapeutic interventions for patients with metastatic disease, as well as enrollment into clinical trials, and it sets an example for the whole community in how to successfully adopt Signatera into routine practice. In the surveillance setting, we look forward to more data and insights from the INTERCEPT program in the future and to other leading cancer centers being inspired to replicate this model. Also in CRC, we completed enrollment in June for the ALTAIR trial. As a reminder, ALTAIR is part of the CIRCULATE-Japan platform, which includes three prospective arms as shown on this slide. First, the observational GALAXY study plus two randomized Phase 3 studies ALTAIR for treatment escalation in the MRD positive population and VEGA for de-escalation in the MRD-negative population. With ALTAIR, we aim to establish the utility of extended adjuvant treatment as well as treatment on molecular recurrence in MRD-positive patients. We know there is a significant percentage of MRD-positive patients who will not respond to standard adjuvant chemotherapy and who we believe may benefit from a drug called TAS-102. Given that TAS-102 is already approved for use in the metastatic setting when chemotherapy has failed. In the trial MRD-positive patients or randomized to receive TAS-102 or placebo after completing standard chemotherapy, it's important to note that for anyone who was initially MRD-negative and who entered the VEGA trial, if follow on Signatera testing changes to ctDNA positive within two years, they can switch out of VEGA and get randomized into the treatment arm in ALTAIR. This may definitively show the benefit of treatment on molecular recurrence for CRC patients that are being surveilled with Signatera. We believe this trial will demonstrate how Signatera can improve outcomes for CRC patients with detectable ctDNA before it becomes evident on imaging. We expect primary results on ALTAIR to be available mid next year, and given the randomized nature of the study, we believe a successful outcome can be definitive and practice changing. ALTAIR and INTERCEPT should be considered in the context of Natera's broader clinical roadmap in CRC one of our most important areas of investment. With the GALAXY study, we look forward to presenting updated data in an oral presentation at the ESMO Conference this October, now with disease-free survival data up to 24-months, and we are submitting our published data for review by the NCCN Committee. The work on these studies has been underway for many years with multiple readouts expected between now and 2026. We expect the results will continue to demonstrate both the prognostic and predictive value of Signatera and given the scale and quality of these studies, including upwards of 15,000 CRC patients across different settings of care, we think this pipeline creates a significant competitive advantage. We plan to follow the same playbook and multiple other disease indications, particularly in breast cancer. Our first study in breast cancer was the Coombes paper published in 2019, which helped us secure Medicare coverage for Signatera uniquely across all subtypes of the disease to achieve adoption. However, into practice guidelines and broader reimbursement from private payers, we believe we need to generate more evidence including additional high quality biobank studies as well as randomized clinical trials. For example, we have spoken before about the EBLISS [ph] expansion cohort. This will have three times more patients and five times more plasma time points than what was previously published with significantly longer follow-up beyond five years. We presented the results at ASCO in 2022 and looked forward to the publication of this expanded cohort. In addition, earlier this year, we published new data from the I-SPY 2 trial, which examined patients in the neoadjuvant setting before surgery. We're now building on our partnership with the I-SPY 2 trial consortium, integrating the testing prospectively into their platform. The use of neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer is growing in popularity, and there are several unmet clinical needs where we think Signatera can help. For example, can certain patients shorten the duration or skip chemotherapy altogether and proceed faster to surgery? Conversely, if a patient has rising levels of ctDNA, should they switch earlier to a different type of therapy? Across all of these settings, neoadjuvant, adjuvant and surveillance, we have multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in the pipeline across all subtypes of disease, but with extra emphasis in HR-positive HER2-negative disease. Given the size of that population, the only studies that have been announced to date are DARE and LEADER, which are ongoing, and which as a reminder are Phase 2 studies that monitor HR-positive HER2-negative patients in the surveillance setting and offer treatment on molecular recurrence. This clinical pipeline gives us multiple shots on goal in breast cancer and with co-sponsorship from our pharma and academic partners, the investments are efficient enough to work within our financial goals. We look forward to announcing more details in the future about all of these studies on this page. In summary, we believe the quality of our clinical data, the breadth of our Medicare coverage, the volume and speed of test adoption and the strength of our research partnerships will allow us to continue extending our first mover advantage in breast cancer. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Brophy to discuss our financial results and outlook. Mike. Happy to. Hey, Puneet. So yes, we've \u2013 obviously, we've enjoyed some good success with Medicare thus far. And we have multiple additional submissions that are planned for this year, one under review right now. I think you can look at the data that we've generated and see where the validity is shaping up to support coverage decisions. We've discussed before. We think we have strong data in gastro and esophageal cancers in melanoma and looking forward to generating and publishing that data in pancreatic and lung and recently a paper in Merkel cell carcinoma. So I think there's a very nice pipeline shaping up. Keep in mind that I think that's \u2013 each one of those is going to add a smaller and smaller percentage of the patient population that we test as well. So the coverages we've gotten thus far have been super important, especially with breast cancer coming in uniquely across all subtypes. To your question about pan-cancer coverage, at this point, we are really planning for generating the relevant data indication by indication. And if we see an opportunity to make that inflection we're definitely going to do that. But we know how the NCCN guidelines committees operate as well. They're also structured and organized by indication. And so we think the smart thing to do is just continue generating great evidence."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we had another very strong quarter. Volumes were up more than 23% versus Q2 of last year, with all products delivering strong growth. Revenues grew even faster, up 32% versus last year and 8% sequentially. We paired that revenue growth with continued COGS improvements to achieve a gross margin just above 45% compared to 39% in Q1. This, combined with stable operating expenses, led us to deliver another significant reduction in our quarterly cash burn. We were pleased to be significantly increasing the revenue guide this quarter to a midpoint of $1.025 billion, and we remain on track for our OpEx and cash burn reduction targets in the guide. We believe we are on track to hit all the financial goals we set for this year and beyond. We also continue to strengthen our leadership in data generation. In June, we attended the American Transplant Congress and unveiled key data from the ProActive trial, showing the value of our Prospera test in kidney transplant rejection. ProActive is proving to be a pivotal trial, and I'll share some of those findings here shortly. In women's health, we published the fourth paper from the SMART trial in the Journal Genetics in Medicine. This study was the largest prospective clinical validation of screening for sex chromosomal aneuploidies with NIPT. We were pleased to earn additional peer-reviewed recognition for SMART, further demonstrating the strength of our data and the clinical value of our Panorama test. In oncology, we crossed a key milestone in the quarter with the publication of more than 50 peer-reviewed papers. We also had a substantial presence at ASCO including readouts on key Signatera data in collaboration with some of the most well-respected healthcare institutions in the country. We shared excellent performance in the EMPower Lung trial demonstrating the utility of Signatera in lung cancer, where IO is the standard of care, which supports our on-market and reimbursed IO monitoring indication. And in CRC, we had key readouts from the GALAXY arm of CIRCULATE-Japan and the INTERCEPT trial from MD Anderson. Coupled with the completion of the enrollment in the ALTAIR trial, and several other prospective randomized studies underway, we continue building a robust platform to demonstrate the prognostic and predictive value of Signatera in CRC. Altogether, we think these trials continue to build a strong case for future NCCN guideline inclusion, which Solomon will cover later in the call. In terms of other key updates, we recently announced two very significant litigation results in our favor. First, a jury in Delaware reached a unanimous verdict in favor of Natera in the patent infringement lawsuit filed against ArcherDX and Invitae. The jury found that all of accused products, including personalized cancer monitoring used for MRD indication infringed three of our patents and that all three patents are valid. The jury also awarded a $19.35 million award in past damages including lost profits and a royalty of 10%. At a future date, a judge will determine whether to grant an injunction against ArcherDX and Invitae's personalized monitoring MRD test. If that is not granted, we will ask the judge to award ongoing royalties at a rate higher than 10%. And second, we also announced in July, a favorable decision in the false advertising case brought by a competitor. The court reversed findings returned by a jury in March of 2022 and overturned the previous damages award, thereby reducing it from $45 million down to $0 [ph]. Great. So with that, let's get into some of the business trends on the next slide. We had another strong volume quarter, growing more than 23% versus last year. This represents strong year-on-year growth across the business and another particularly strong Signatera quarter. We saw our typical trends in seasonality in process units in the women's health business, where Q1 is usually our biggest quarter and Q2 is slightly down. This trend was amplified this year because we made a concerted effort this spring to reduce volume from some of the larger accounts that we're not generating an adequate margin and didn't have a clear path to improvement. Given our scale, we think that's a sensible exercise, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve women's health product margins in the second half of this year. Having said that, we are still committed to the initiatives we discussed earlier this year where we've taken our lower margin volumes in exchange for future upside, which we'll touch on later. Overall, in volumes, we're in some very large markets that are underpenetrated, and we think there's a lot of opportunity for growth. particularly in Signatera given the huge market size in the very early stages of penetration. Speaking of Signatera, the next slide shows yet another very strong year-on-year volume trend, almost doubling in size once again. Compared to Q1, we saw an acceleration in absolute units and the growth engine really continues to be in clinical indications where we have Medicare reimbursement. That trend was also apparent in the Signatera clinical ASP, which were once again well ahead of the schedule. Recall the Signatera ASPs were in the $500 a couple of years ago and that progressed to the mid-700s in Q3 and Q4 of last year. We were very pleased to be in the low 800s in Q1, and now we've progressed again into the mid-800s ASP range. At the same time, we've made some meaningful COGS progress on our tissue exome workflow and reducing supplier costs in some places, which further pushed up our gross margin for this product. There's still more progress to be made, and Mike will get into some more details on the drivers of these trends later in the call. The volume, ASP and COGS achievements helped to drive our revenue and margin outperformance in the quarter. I'll touch first on revenue on the next slide, which highlights our sequential revenue trends over the last five quarters. I highlighted the sequential trend from Q1 to Q2 of last year compared to this year. As you can see, we saw an acceleration of revenue growth between Q1 and Q2 of this year despite the disruption in the transplant business that we noted on the last call. The revenue growth was driven by Signatera clinical, pharma and women's health, which Mike will discuss shortly in the call. Finally, on gross margins. This quarter, we had an excellent margin of 45%. This was amplified a bit with some onetime events. So on a normalized basis, we think margins would have been around 43% in Q2. This is a big step up from our 39% in Q1, and Mike will go over a few of the sustainable areas that led to our significant margin improvement later in the call. Our strong execution enabled us to overcome the negative impact that some of the bets we made where we took on lower margin volume in exchange for future opportunity. We believe these bets are on track. First, the California prenatal screening program volume is now largely shifted back to Panorama versus Vasistera, which has helped us on both margin and revenue. Second, we still believe there's upside opportunity on expanded carrier screening as coverage improves in the future. And finally, of course, we believe in growing Signatera, despite it dragging down the margin. As Signatera margins improve, which they have been, the margin drag impact will reverse. While these still have room for upside with our strong COGS and ASP execution, we feel very good about continuing to deliver our strong gross margins around the middle of our guide range for the rest of the year. Okay, now let's move on to women's health. We now have more than 80 peer-reviewed publications in our women's health business. As a reminder, one of those, the SMART study is the largest prospective NIPT study ever performed with greater than 20,000 patients enrolled across 21 global centers. All Panorama NIPT results included in the analysis were confirmed with molecular diagnosis as clinical truth. As I mentioned, the recent Genetics in Medicine paper is the fourth from the SMART study was published officially in May. This real world data confirmed Panorama's excellent performance when screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies across over 17,000 pregnancies, and all screening results were validated with clinical outcomes. This is the largest prospective clinical validation study of NIPT for sex chromosome aneuploidies. In addition to this latest publication on sex chromosome aneuploidies, we also studied the performance of Panorama to detect common aneuploidies such as Trisomy 21. Our results showed a very high sensitivity and specificity resulting in a 95% positive predicted value for Trisomy 21, which is very strong. One of the most significant aspects of the SMART study are the results on 22q. The 22q results demonstrated a high prevalence for 22q of approximately one in 1,500, a high sensitivity and a low false positive rate of 0.05% resulting in a positive predicted value of 53% or approximately one in two. This PPV is excellent and as a comparison, it's more than 10 times the positive predicted value of maternal serum screening of Trisomy 21, which is an approach ACOG still endorses. We feel the data supporting the performance in clinical utility of 22q screening is very strong. Shifting gears to carrier screening also in Q2, the FDA approved the first gene therapy for pediatric patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who have a confirmed genetic mutation in the gene. DMD affects roughly one in 3,500 boys causing progressive muscle weakness, heart issues, and breathing difficulties. One of the most important benefits of carrier screening is early diagnosis for conditions like DMV, so that families and doctors can prepare for and have the earliest possible access to treatments like the one that just got approved. Our Horizon carrier screen includes the option to screen for DMD along with many other conditions with treatments that are either FDA approved or currently in trials. So we think this strengthens the case for broad panel carrier screening where we think the clinical utility is strong with a positive ACMG guidelines supporting expanded carrier screening 2021 and a positive statement from the National Society of Genetic Counselors earlier this year. We are hopeful that these and other changes can allow us to help more patients and pave the way for improvements in reimbursement rates moving into next year. As many of you know, ACOG held their annual meeting in May, which led to the scheduling of two prenatal committee working groups, one in June and one scheduled for September. Based on that timing, we anticipate having more information later this fall on any changes to future guidelines. Okay, moving on to Oregon Health. Earlier in the year, we discussed the negative impact of the recent Medicare change and the change is now fully reflected in our guidance. As we said before, the impact was offset somewhat with our receiving heart reimbursement, and now that we've seen some of the lost kidney volumes come back as well, we think we've come out the other side well positioned. In addition, we've taken steps to realign the Oregon Health business where we are now in a position to drive volume and revenue growth while keeping our expenses stable. I wanted to start with a few key stats on clinical adoption and volume growth. On Renasight, which is our test for chronic kidney disease, we've continued to demonstrate strong clinical utility, including data that was presented at the National Kidney Foundation Conference in April. We're looking forward to the publication of RenaCARE study, which we think can provide strong support going forward. In heart and lung, we've continued to have productive dialogue with our customers, including at the recent Annual Meeting of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. Thus far in 2023, 50% of the top 20 transplant centers have used Prospera Heart and 50% of the top 20 transplant centers have used Prospera Lung. In addition, the number of active users of Prospera Heart has nearly doubled in the past 12 months where the test volume has more than doubled. Of course, we were pleased to receive Medicare coverage and heart transplantation earlier this year, which provided some nice upside on reimbursement. We also look forward to the Prospera Heart data we expect will publish later this year from the prospective DTRT study sponsored by the NIH. In early June, we had a strong presence at the American Transplant Congress meeting showcasing the utility of Prospera and kidney and heart transplantation. This included three oral presentations and several posters in a symposium led by medical experts in the field. I'd like to spend a few minutes on the ProActive data that was featured. As a reminder, ProActive is a large prospective multi-site donor-derived cell-free DNA study in kidney transplant patients. The study has enrolled renal transplant patients from 54 participating centers that are being followed over three years. At ATC, we outlined several highlights from the interim analysis of the first 1,600 patients with 18 months of follow-up data. Importantly, the data demonstrates that Prospera Kidney is a leading indicator of rejection, predicting antibody mediated rejection up to four months, and T-cell mediated rejection up to two months in advance of biopsy. This evidence is impressive and highlights the value of Prospera as a tool for rejection that can provide early insight to graft health when used as an ongoing monitoring tool. This ProActive data bolsters recent sentiments from leading medical societies and organizations like the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the European Society of Transplantation who have endorsed the use of donor derived cell-free DNA surveillance to rule out subclinical rejection. We look forward to publishing data from the ProActive study as early as the end of this year in sharing additional readouts in the future that we believe will help transform the current standard of care for kidney transplant patients. We think the evidence will help bolster the case for coverage of Prospera in the surveillance setting in the future. Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Solomon to cover our recent progress in oncology. Solomon? Yes, so I guess first I'll say, we did benefit, from both of those, on a certain basis. But, I think as Mike mentioned in the gross margin, there were some onetime events, that I think accounted for, something like 250 basis points, that I think hit us in Q2, but won't necessarily be there in Q3. So we do expect, margin improvement as the years go on. But I think, Mike, you might be better to kind of get into the details on this. Mike? Yes, that's a great question. So we've seen continued growth in the number of accounts that are using us and particularly in the accounts that are using Natera in a sort of sustainable way. Our account retention rates have been very high, and I think that has to do with sort of the stickiness of the product. I mean once you do whole exome sequencing and set up a patient for MRD, it's not going to make sense to go back and sort of redo the exome sequencing on that patient and set them up again for MRD testing. So I think we really haven't seen any of the tumor-informed MRD companies out in the marketplace, if they have, it's been on like an extremely limited basis. I think, of course, Guardant and the Reveal products are out there, we see them from time to time. We do know there are some accounts that sort of use both products, but there's always going to be competition. And I think this is a very large market. And we think particularly in this setting, because of the stickiness dynamic that I described and because of the extensive leads that we have in peer-reviewed publications and coverage and just setting up our infrastructure, that the first-mover advantage is going to be incredibly important here. From the IP standpoint, as we've said before, we have a very strong portfolio of intellectual property related to cell-free DNA particularly in the field of oncology. And you're seeing, I think, the first of those wins now with the suit that we described \u2013 the win that we described. And I think there's other ongoing suits. If someone's infringing on our IP, we intend to defend ourselves. Yes. First, I'll make a couple of comments, and then maybe, Mike, you can kind of get into the details. And so I think there's opportunities that we've talked about before on improving ASP that come from just sort of turning the crank on some of the billing operations things and improving our processes and protocols. And obviously, we're working on those. In addition, we're also seeing, I think, the kind of first beginnings of some good coverage for expanded carrier screening. I think that's still very early and there's still a lot of opportunity there to improve the ASP, but certainly, there's some upside. Mike, do you want to talk about any of the specifics? Yes. I mean the way that we've kind of set this up is we've tried to thoroughly validate all of our tests and deliver very high-quality peer-reviewed publications. And in the event that there is some change from a regulatory standpoint, we think we're very well positioned there. We're obviously in touch with various agencies and governing bodies and doing, I think, what we can to try to stay informed on what's happening to make sure that we're prepared. But the key is you have to have very thoroughly validated products an extensive peer-reviewed publications, and we have that. And that puts us in a great position should the guidelines change in anyway. Yes, that's a good question. I mean, look, we really don't get any information with respect to kind of what happens in these various meetings or even details, all the topics and things. So, I think, we just kind of take a step back and look at kind of the trends that are happening from a bigger picture. What are the topics that ACOG might be interested in? And I think, certainly 22q given the SMART study and expanded carrier screening given that significant portion of the community is now doing expanded carrier screening or topics that I think would be of interest. What we focus on is publishing data like we did in the SMART study, largest prospective trial that's ever been done in NIPT, excellent performance specs for 22q, both on disease incidence, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value. And we think it meets all of the criteria that one would need to issue coverage. But again, we don't really know exactly what's happening. We just see that the meetings are occurring and hoping that they're discussing. If they do put out a guideline, I would imagine that we would find out more information kind of late fall on the status and what the funnel timing is going to be. Yes. So American cancer study has really been leading the charge in a very bipartisan way on their biomarker bill. And from what we understand, it's going well. I think they now have 10-plus states that have adopted it into law. I think from our side, it's still early. Once the bill goes into place, then you have to see if they're going to pay and kind of what the hoops are that you have to jump over. But it's certainly creating discussions with payers, and I wouldn't be surprised to see some additional commercial coverage come in from other regional plans, maybe national plans in the near future. Yes. Solomon, why don't you take that one? Yes, I think \u2013 sorry, Mike, go ahead. Yes, I was just going to tell on the volume standpoint, I think that the volume kind of shifted over in sort of late Q4 and Q1. But go ahead, Mike, if you want to comment further. Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. I mean there's been various Supreme Court rulings that have come out. And I think we haven't seen any impacts in the areas where those have come out. I appreciate the question. Yes. We think NIPT is around 50% penetrated now overall. So obviously, there's still a lot of room for growth there. There's a certain portion of patients that never get screening. And so they're not going to be eligible. So you're never going to get to 100% penetration. But we've said over the next two years to three years that this can get up to kind of 80%, 85% penetration, something in that range. And we do think there's continued shift away from maternal serum screening toward NIPT. Yes. Mike, why don't you talk a little about the margin consensus and sort of revenue guide. And then I'll make a couple of comments on just COGS and ASP overall that I think can help improve the margin, but go ahead. Yes, I just wanted to kind of jump off on some of the longer-term opportunities as well. I mean, look, we said 45% gross margin this quarter with a couple of those percentage points from one-time events. So kind of net at around 43% sustainable. Now, there's a lot of opportunities to increase that as we go forward. I mean, there's significant COGS reduction projects that we're working on right now. So moving to higher throughput sequencing instruments, we're at the tail end of finishing some of those projects. We've identified three \u2013 potentially four logistics based COGS improvement projects that we can, we think we can save $10 million plus maybe $20 million on the COGS line as we move to implement those. And then there's still room to run to bring additional tissue sequencing in-house and negotiate certain aspects of the business with suppliers at a deeper level. And then lastly on Signatera, as more and more and more volume moves to the recurrence monitoring setting, which is the shift that we see occurring as the business gets bigger, of course, more people are staying on the test and they're moving, shifting to gross margin, the COGS go down, so that improves the gross margin. And then on the other side of things, you've got ASP improvement opportunities. And so we have just turning the crank on billing operations and just getting better. And I think that is going to help in the future, and we haven't really seen the impact to that yet. But there's been a lot of work that's done there. And then we have getting paid for a higher percentage of the tests that we perform, of course, in Signatera every time we get one of these commercial policies, every time we get a new Medicare policy that helps with expanded carrier screening as payers come on and start paying or as guidelines come out that helps. There's things like 22q if that does come into guidelines that could make a significant impact. So the range that we're in right now while we're seeing improvements and we \u2013 it's sustainable, we'll see continued improvements. There's a lot that we can do that we are doing over time that are going to put us in really very strong position in the future. Yes. I'll make a couple comments and then maybe Solomon. So I think this is really the first year that we have a shot at NCCN guidelines because I think we were very kind of clear leading in last year that, hey, if the Galaxy paper's not published, it's not going to be considered. And in fact, it wasn't considered in the vote. So this is really the first year with Galaxy being published that we have a chance to be considered in the vote. There's different levels of guideline and kind of what we've said is, we think we can be potentially included as a footnote which would be where they list out the major prognostic factors for colorectal cancer. And so I think getting in there as a footnote where Signatera is listed that would be a win. And then, maybe down the road being listed in the official algorithm recommendation table. Now, they've also kind of highlighted a couple things where they said, hey, these are areas where we'd like to see the additional data. One was randomized trials, and Solomon just described the ALTAIR study. I mean, it's incredible that we have completed enrollment on a large scale prospective randomized study looking at extended adjuvant treatment and escalation for MRD positive patients and treatment on molecular recurrence for patients that start off negative and become positive on surveillance. So the fact that the randomized trial is done enrolling is an enormous step forward, and we plan on reading that data out next summer. The other area where they said, they wanted to see data was on the clinical value of surveillance. And the great news is the INTERCEPT study, which we weren't even involved in, we just ran the testing for MD Anderson showed two very significant paths for clinical utility for patients that are positive with surveillance. So we think both of those are very good signs. And then, it's also you have to think beyond CRC as well. I think, there's other products and other indications where we have good data and course we're kind of looking at opportunities there as well. Yes. So I would say, initially what happened when one of our competitors, I think closed up shop we saw big influx of very low margin business coming in. And we kind of swallowed that in Q4 and then in Q1. And what's happened since then is that we \u2013 there's been a \u2013 there's been some payers that have revised their policies and started paying in addition to I think us improving the sort of operations and appeals with some of the other payers that maybe already had a policy in place or that would consider paying on a case-by-case basis. So we have seen, I think we're at the very early stages of kind of turning the ship here and obviously getting a new guideline in place from ACOG I think is going to help. The existing policy from ACOG is helpful and that's why we have seen payers change guidelines. But if something more definitive came out, obviously that would kind of be the tipping point. There are some customers as well where we've kind of said, hey, look, certain payers may not cover this test, and then we kind of reeducate them on what might be covered. And in some cases they make a decision that they want to order a smaller panel."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, May 9, 2023. I would now like to turn the call -- conference call over to Mike Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our first quarter of 2023. On the line, I am joined by Steve Chapman, our CEO; Alex Aleshin, Chief Medical Officer, stepping in for Solomon Moshkevich, who wasn't able to join the call today due to company business; and John Fesko, Chief Business Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be close to our IR site as soon as it's available. Starting on Slide two. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance such as our operational and financial outlook and projections, our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various hiring future products, including product capabilities, we expect to release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our better it based on the factors currently not a and actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K or 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by forward-looking statements.

We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on form during the quarter, unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numerical growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteven Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. As you can see from the highlights, we are off to a very strong start as we continue to drive robust financial performance maintain our leadership position in cell-free DNA analysis and achieve important milestones across the business. We process roughly 626,000 tests in the quarter, up 28% from Q1 of last year and 12% sequentially versus Q4. We generated $242 million in revenues in the quarter, which was a major increase, both versus Q4 and year-on-year. We also saw strong volume growth. We performed 71,000 Signatera and Altera test in the quarter, which is more than 100% growth versus Q1 of last year. We saw a very strong step-up in clinical volumes over Q4 of last year and is generating continued momentum this spring. As a result, we are pleased to be raising our annual revenue guide that we just set two months ago. We are moving to a new range of $995 million to $1.015 billion for the year. The rest of the elements of the guide will remain the same for now. We are on pace to hit our margin target of 41% to 44% and hit our reduced cash burn target of $300 million to $325 million. You will see our quarterly cash burn in Q1 cut almost in half versus Q1 2022, and we feel we're on track for our 2024 cash flow breakeven goal that we previously announced. In addition, we've been conservative with the impact of guidelines for 22q and expanded carrier screening and MRD testing in our ASP forecast. Note that these guidelines are not necessary to achieve our financial goals. We continue to extend our leadership position in women's health with two significant NIPT publications in a third paper that has been accepted for publication. We now have more than 40 published peer-reviewed papers highlighting the performance of our Panorama NIPT including the landmark SMART study. We think this clinical differentiation continues to be an important volume driver as the NIPT market continues to grow. Of course, we've had a string of wins for Signatera this spring as well. We continued our data leadership with several presentations at AACR, and we are very excited to announce two oral and 12 poster presentations that are out of this June. In addition, a new study demonstrated Signatera's performance in Stages three and four melanoma and the expanded I-SPY 2 study demonstrated the value of Signatera for breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. We think the neoadjuvant breast setting is important, and we will dig into that later in the call. After securing Medicare coverage for breast cancer in March, we were pleased to receive the major commercial coverage decision for Signatera with a pan tumor coverage policy from Blue Shield of California. In Oregon Health, we secured Medicare reimbursement for Prospera in heart transplantation. We haven't included this in the guidance originally. So this is a nice win. In kidney, in line with our expectations, we are seeing some modest disruption of the updated Medicare policy. But as you can see from the results in the guide, this isn't making an impact in the context of our overall business. especially with the upside from heart reimbursement now coming in. I'll get into more details a bit later in the call. Okay, great. Let me get into some of the business trends. We've more than tripled the quarterly volume since the beginning of 2019 and our growth rates remain in the mid-20s despite the significant increase in the scale of a business. I think that gives a sense of the commercial execution track record and shows that we are offering critical services is in very large patient populations. You can also see that Q1 historically represents a big step up over the prior year and 2023 has proven to be no different. This is driven in part by the seasonal patterns of NIPT favor in Q1, but also shows our ongoing success in taking market share and represents a continuation of the broader shift from maternal serum screening to NIPT. As a reminder, we think NIPT is only about 50% penetrated today. This year, our Q1 volume growth was further amplified by three strategies we have been pursuing that increased volume for the long term but we expect it would impact gross margins this year. One was our decision to continue operating in California and to participate in the prenatal screening program and into effect last fall when most lab providers opted to not participate. California initially required patients to go through the state program. Despite the low margin of the state's limited NIPT offering, we thought it was important to provide access for this patient population. However, after a legal challenge, the courts have now allowed NIPT to be offered outside of the state program, enabling us to regain some of the lost margin while increasing our volumes. So we're optimistic that we made the right decision to stay. The second was our decision to serve many new carrier screening customers after competitors exited the space last fall. Many of these customers are high-volume accounts and they have a preference for the broader carrier screening panels that currently have a very low margin profile. We opted to take on many of these accounts because we feel the clinical utility and guideline support for broad screening is strong, and we hope to see reimbursement rates improve as we go into 2024. The third is our decision to continue driving Signatera volumes because of the growth ramp and the upfront expense, Signature's margin profile is lower than our overall company margin. However, we expect that delta to narrow as we continue to lower COGS and increase ASP through various initiatives. Obviously, growing Signatera is the right decision as we are still in the very early days in oncology. We have established a strong competitive advantage for Signatera, particularly with the extensive body of peer review data we generated, which is now leading to strong uptake and more coverage. With each of these strategies, there was a trade-off between short-term gross margins and the future upside potential. Despite these volume bets, we've significantly improved our cash burn trajectory by continuing to grow top line revenue on top of now much lower operating expenses. You see this happening with our net cash burn reduction in Q1. Our aggressive cash burn goal is remaining intact and our strong gross margin guidance of 41% to 44% for the year. And again, we've been conservative with the potential upside for future society guidelines, which could boost things further. The next slide demonstrates the strong volume trends are translating into revenue at roughly the same pace. And as we just mentioned, we think there is upside on 22q broad panel carrier screening and Signatera clinical volumes. As we described in detail in March, we were very pleased to see strong updates to the ACMG guidelines on 22q. On ACOG guidelines, we think the data published in SMART are compelling. We're hopeful for a positive update soon, but of course, we don't have direct insight into the guideline process. With carrier screening off the back of favorable existing ACMG ACOG guidelines, we're seeing payers start to change their policies, which we think is a good sign. In oncology, we are very pleased to see sequential progress in our Signatera clinical ASPs moving from the mid-700s in Q4 to the low 800s in Q1. This trend was driven largely by incremental progress in our Medicare and recurrence monitoring mix with a smaller benefit coming from breast coverage. So for Signatera, we are ahead of schedule on our reimbursement trajectory, and we remain optimistic that we can see continued improvement over the course of '23. For clarity, we're not dependent on NCCN guidelines to give the ASP to a much stronger place Also, the signatory gross margin benefit from improvements in ASP was offset by the fact that we haven't yet gotten the full COGS benefit on the tissue exome, which is a benefit we expect to realize this year progresses. The next slide gets into the compelling new publications on our Panorama NIPT. As a reminder, Panorama represents around 50% of the NIPT market in the United States with differentiated capabilities, they're supported by more than 40 peer-reviewed publications. This includes SMART, the largest prospective multicenter NIPT study, where we clinically validated Panorama's performance in over 18,000 pregnancies with genetic outcomes confirmed for all samples analyzed in the study. With recent publications, we are continuing to add to the body of evidence. The first published in obstetrics and gynecology evaluated patients who receive a rare Panorama result that could indicate suspected material malignancy. We show that when Panorama sees a very specific type of DNA pattern, more than two third of the time, these patients have maternal cancer. The PPV of 67% is quite high, so doctors seeing this result are advised to investigate further. It's an extremely rare finding but one that could provide important and potentially life-saving clinical information for these patients and their doctors. The second is a new publication from SMART published in [indiscernible]. This publication found that in a subcategory of about 1 in 200 patients, Panorama was able to determine a significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. These patients were 4x more likely to have preeclampsia and 4x to 10x more likely to have preterm birth. In these patients, panorama may provide important information about increased risk for adverse outcome which could ultimately help doctors to more closely manage these pregnancies at high risk. Finally, we learned that another publication was accepted from SMART by genetics in medicine. This is the largest prospective clinical validation of screening for sex chromosome and employees with NIPT across over 17,000 pregnancies in a real-world setting, Panorama's performance when screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies was excellent. As we are seeing, the SMART study continues to yield critical new insights about NIPT and the real-world performance of Panorama. As the market expands, we think our strong data leadership continue to differentiate Panorama from other NIPTs. Okay. Let me transition over to Oregon Health. As I mentioned, we were pleased to secure Medicare reimbursement for Prospera in heart transplant. We hadn't originally included this in our guidance because we can't always predict when coverage will come in. Many of you will recall that we launched Prospera in heart ahead of reimbursement. So now that we're covered, we're already off to a running start with a nice volume ramp. We also have additional data count from the NIH-sponsored prospective DTRT study, which we think will be published later this year. So we're feeling really good about our trajectory in parts. Also in heart, but extending to kidney as well, we were pleased to see medical society endorsements of donor-derived cell-free DNA testing from the ASTS and AST in addition to recent endorsements from ISHLT and ESOT. These guidelines and statements could serve as the basis for further volume growth where today, the markets are very underpenetrated. On kidney, we've seen modest disruption in the transplant volumes as physicians worked out how to implement new Medicare policy. Some of the disruption is based on confusion surrounding the policy, which we think will resolve itself over time and some represents a slight shift in ordering patterns. The magnitude of the addition is in line with our expectations and it's offset somewhat by the upside from our heart coverage. As you can see from our raised revenue guidance, this isn't making a material impact on our overall trajectory. Looking ahead, the recent society endorsements provide a potential path to expand access and increase penetration. Plus, we've got new data from the now fully enrolled proactive trial that we think could help further expand patient access. The first readout will be at ATC in June. We think it's impressive data that can benefit the entire industry in support of donor-derived cell-free DNA testing, so we look forward to sharing it with the community. Now let me turn it over to John Fesko, Chief Business Officer, to give a few additional updates on chronic kidney disease in oncology. John?\nJohn Fesko: Thanks, Steve. As a reminder, we also have a chronic kidney disease genetic testing product line, Renasight. Renasight looks at conditions like polycystic kidney disease, or Alport syndrome, in germline DNA of those patients who have already been diagnosed with CKD. In the future, we think every patient who is diagnosed with CKD could get genetic testing. The market opportunity is potentially very large because over one million patients in the U.S. are diagnosed each year, and there are about 37 million patients in the U.S. living with CKD. To help define the clinical utility of genetic testing in this context, Natera sponsored the definitive RenaCARE study. We started working on this in 2019 and collaborated with leading investigators from Colombia, Yale, Penn, UPMC, NYU, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic and others to design the study. We completed enrollment last year with more than 1,600 patients from over 30 centers. The RenaCARE study is designed to eases the incidence of genetic conditions in the CKD population and then importantly, how Renasight's genetic findings could impact clinical management. Some have asked us what success looks like in the RenaCARE state. While we're waiting to publish the results, the best proxy we found is hereditary cancer testing. We talked about this last quarter, but I think it's an instructive comparison. The previous large study of nearly 3,000 cancer patients published in general oncology, 13.3% of patients had a pathogenic germline variant indicating hereditary cancer. Of those patients with a high penetrance variants had resulting treatment modifications. At RenaCARE reached out, we will be looking at these same metrics, including the fraction of study participants who have a pathogenic variant associated with CKD as well as what fraction of patients who test positive had their treatment modified after the pathogenic variant is discovered with Renasight, stay tuned for more information over time. Okay. Let's dive into some of the oncology trends on the next slide. We covered the strong overall volume growth at the top of the call. The growth in our clinical oncology volumes in Q1 is actually masked somewhat by a lumpiness in our pharma volumes that favor Q4. Typically, pharma companies will order a larger number of tests in Q4 and as they need to utilize excess budget for the year. Our clinical volumes were actually up roughly 17% sequentially just since Q4 of 2022, and we've seen continued strong momentum so far in Q2. We are continuing to concentrate on the core indications where we have Medicare reimbursement. More than 80% of our volumes are now coming from covered indications. We were also really pleased to see ASPs make a meaningful step up in Q1 from the mid-700s to the low 800s, which we estimate was driven by the mix of time points ordered and some incremental benefit of breast reimbursement. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we think there are some opportunities to improve our collections within covered indications, expanded to new indications and drive more commercial coverage as well. On that note, our first commercial coverage policies in March. The recent decision from Blue Shield of California is a good case study for the kind of progress we are making with commercial plans for are increasingly appreciating the clinical and economic utility that Signatera offers. The fact that this was a pan-tumor coverage policy highlights the breadth of our data across a number of cancer types, which we think is a key differentiator. In addition to Blue Shield of California, we also secured coverage from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana for serial testing with Signatera for plan members diagnosed with colorectal cancer, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and pan cancer IO therapy monitoring. We think there's momentum on commercial coverage, and we look forward to seeing how things progress. Right before I turn it over to Alex, I want to briefly touch on our IP portfolio. As we've discussed in the past, we have a broad portfolio of MRD IP, only a small portion of which has been deployed in litigation. The remainder is not yet in play as we assess how things evolve. With that, I will now turn it over to Alex to review our oncology data in more detail. Alex?\nAlexey Aleshin: Thanks, John. First, let me provide some detail on the data road map in colorectal cancer. As we predicted, Signatera was not included in the updated NCCN guidelines that were published this spring. This is because the CIRCULATE Galaxy paper published in January and was unavailable for the NCCN systemic evidence review process that occurred prior to the August meeting and therefore, was not included in the committee vote. Nevertheless, we are pleased to see that the 18-month real-world prospective data merit an inclusion in the discussion section of the updated guidelines and that Signatera was acknowledged as having prognostic and predictive value. Now that the CIRCULATE GALAXY data has been published and highlighted on the cover of Nature Medicine, we plan to submit the peer reviewed data in time for the 2023 systemic evidence review. While it's possible that the GALAXY study may be sufficient to change NCCN guidelines, we know that the NCCN committee referenced the need for more data in both the adjuvant and surveillance study. The good news is that this data is already coming. There's a randomized biobank study in the adjuvant setting that is expected to read out later this year, followed by the prospective Altera data expected in 2024, which would address both the adjuvant and surveillance questions. Furthermore, the randomized de-escalation arms of the Japan and U.S. CIRCULATE continue to enroll out. with the readouts currently anticipated in 2026. There are also several nonrandomized trials that we expect will be at the field, including a large commercial experience study that will be submitted for publication later this year, extended follow-up from the GALAXY study, plus the BESPOKE trial where enrollment is now complete and which has relevant endpoints in both adjuvant and surveillance settings. With these many shots on goal, we believe we're in a good position. Additionally, it's worth noting that this list is far from expensive. As it does not include other independent clinical utility studies being conducted on Signatera by multiple institutions that are now beginning to read out. Given that we started working on these trials years ago, some dating back as far as six or seven years, we think this pipeline creates a significant competitive advantage going forward. While the CRC data pipeline has been advancing. We continue to make significant progress across multiple other indications. Here, you see six studies with large patient cohorts and more than 500 plasma time points each, either recently published or on the near-term road map. We think that the data from these studies could support clinical adoption and serve as the basis for additional submissions to Medicare. The gastroesophageal in anal cancer papers are highly relevant to GI oncologists who order Signatera and CRC. This is also true for pancreatic cancer, where we are planning to submit for publication a real-world study with more than 300 patients and 1,900 time points. Data that opens new avenues for risk stratifying and managing these patients. For example, the surgery for pancreatic cancer can be extremely more that -- and our data suggests that Signatera may allow for more personalized selection of patients for either surgical or medical management faired disease. We've also had a particular focus on developing data in breast cancer given the scale of the unmet need. So the recent coverage decision we achieved in this histology is a major win for us. Building on our landmark BLISS study published in 2019 and in CCR, we are now following up with an expanded cohort, examining 3x more patients and 5x more plasma time points with significantly longer follow-up. This expanded data was presented at ASCO in 2022 and has already been submitted for publication. And of course, we are very pleased to get the publication out or the ISPY-2 neoadjuvant breast cancer data. We think neoadjuvant breast cancer represents a strong use case for Signatera, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. First, let me tell you about the neoadjuvant setting and how patients are treated today. Up to 50% of all breast cancer patients now get neoadjuvant treatment, which is a growing trend, and it describes any systemic treatment that is rendered before definitive surgery. This can include any combination of the following: chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy or immune therapy. The purpose of neoadjuvant therapy is three. The first is to decrease the risk of distant recurrence; the second is to downstage the tumor to allow for more effective surgery; and the third is to assess treatment response in order to guide adjuvant therapy. However, there are several unmet clinical needs in the neoadjuvant setting. Namely, it's hard to know if the adjuvant therapy is working and if certain patients can avoid or shorten the duration of toxic chemotherapy. The NCCN guidelines themselves state explicitly that accurate assessment of response to new adjuvant therapy is difficult. So there is an opportunity for Signatera to fundamentally change management here. Now let's go over the data. In the study, 28 patients with over 1,000 plasma time points were analyzed. TTA status and trajectory during neoadjuvant therapy were found to be significant predictors of metastatic recurrence or death in HR-positive, HER2-negative as well as triple-negative patients. As you can see on the slide, patients who have a CTA negative after neoadjuvant therapy, has improved survival even when a residual disease was detected at the time of surgery. This is a big deal. Since these patients are being treated with aggressive adjuvant regimen, in the postoperative setting, which may not be necessary. Additionally, in triple-negative breast cancer, this effect could be observed even earlier. As soon as just a few weeks after neoadjuvant therapy was initiated, suggesting that if a patient was to clear their CKA after just one or two cycles, they may be eligible for deescalation of their neoadjuvant regimen and potentially avoid certain forms of additional adjuvant chemotherapy. The second significant finding was that patients were CTA negative at tZERO. This is a time point before new adjuvant therapy was initiated, had exceptionally favorable long-term outcome with significantly improved relative distant recurrence free survival compared to patients who are Signatera-positive at that time point. This is very powerful, indicating that CTA negativity and diagnosis may identify a favorable subgroup of patients that in the future may be managed much less aggressively in terms of the intensity of their chemotherapy, surgery or their radiation treatments. We believe this data can support reimbursement in the neoadjuvant setting and help accelerate the general adoption of neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer patients. It also enables an earlier entry point for patients into the Signatera ecosystem, right at diagnosis, which then allows for seamlessly monitoring these patients after surgery. The data you're seeing today is the result of an incredible amount of time and effort as we initiated our relationship with I-SPY Consortium way back in 2015. As a next step, we are now coordinating with the I-SPY team. to make Signatera a prospectively integrated biomarker in their future studies. Finally, we've kept a busy academic conference schedule this season with a number of key studies being presented at AACR last month, and more being planned to be presented at ASCO in June. Let me highlight a few significant data sets that may be of particular importance for our program going forward. At AACR, we have five poster presentations including new data in esophogastric as well as muscle-invasive bladder cancer, highlighting the utility of Signatera in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant leadings. At ASCO, there will be significant new data spanning across two oral and at least 12 poster presentations. I want to highlight just a few of these studies. The first being a poster discussion of the INTERCEPT program being conducted by MD Anderson. This poster reports on the clinical utility Signatera in the surveillance setting of CRC. Additionally, we look forward to the readout from the Empower 1 study being sponsored by Regeneron in non-small cell lung cancer, which we think will demonstrate the predictive nature of CTA dynamics in patients receiving immune therapy. We know that non-small cell lung cancer remains the largest market for immune therapy use with upwards of 60% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. receiving an IO containing regimen. Lastly, updated data from CIRCULATE Japan, including a focus on the role of CTA dynamics in predicting an adjuvant therapy benefit and risk of recurrence will also be present. Finally, I want to provide a brief update on our ECD program. We continue to make good progress in developing blood-only early cancer detection assay, first for colorectal cancer and later for multi-cancer. We are completing a case-control study that should read out by the end of the year with a presentation to follow thereafter. We remain committed to prudent investment into this program, as we've said before, we will provide updates if and when a significant inflection in spending is warranted. With that, let me hand the call over to Mike to review the financial results. Mike?\nMichael Brophy: Thanks, Alex. The next slide is just a summary of the quarterly financials versus last year. Steve covered the encouraging revenue and volume trends and the three market share initiatives that we've been taking to set up the business future growth at the cost of short-term gross margins. Even with those initiatives underway, I was pleased to see our revenue growth tracking in line with volume growth, which speaks to some of the progress we are making with average selling prices across the business, particularly in Signatera. Average cost of goods sold per unit picked up modestly in the quarter versus Q4 last year. This was expected given the continued significate volume ramp, and we expect to get some additional cost savings from those COGS in Signatera later this year as more of our exome volume continues to be brought in-house. I wanted to emphasize the point Steve made earlier on the call with respect to seasonality in health business. Q1 is usually our strongest quarter, and I think that trend was really amplified in Q1 this year with California NIPT and carrier screening volume gains taken off in November and December last year. When we have had these really big first quarters in the past, women's health volume has been flat to something down sequentially and then returned to sequential growth in the second half of the year. If that was the case this year, we would still be in a great position for an excellent 2023 overall. Of course, Signatera appears to be in a secular growth phase as we continue a significant ramp in volume growth, as we talked about earlier in the call. Last point I'd make here is the noticeable gap between revenue growth and expense growth. We've spent a lot of time on prior calls laying out this strategy, build best-in-class commercial channels that can win and then hold that expense base steady while the revenues and volumes continue to scale. We've done that once before when Natera was really just a women's health business, and we are really pleased to be showing that we are now achieving scale again after a few years of building the organ health and oncology channels. The next slide, I think, gives you a sense of the operating leverage we are starting to see in the business. We've burned a little more than $160 million in Q1 last year, and that is down to about $86 million in Q1 of this year. I will caution you that cash burn will have some swings in the working capital, CapEx and other factors. So we may not have just a linear progression downward on cash burn quarter after quarter. And just to keep things simple, this cash burn metric is just the change in cash and equivalents and short-term investments. So it includes some modest impact of unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio. The overall trajectory is quite clear in my view. The key from my perspective is driving strong revenue growth on flat or low growth operating expenses. I was also pleased to see DSOs trend down once again the second consecutive quarter despite very robust revenue growth. That's a function of us getting some return on our revenue cycle operations focus. We hope to shorten the cash collection cycle further as we continue to gain experience with the nuances of Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans for Signatera reimbursement. Another opportunity for upside is gross margin traction driven by broader reimbursement win. Steve talked about the fact that we could yet see some movement on 22q and carrier screening this year, which would be significant wins given the volume scale we are operating in now, and I think we are showing very encouraging progress on the Signatera ASP. Even without some significant benefit from improved clinical practice guidelines, we continue to think that we are on track to hit our previously stated cash flow breakeven target next year based on our Q1 performance and our outlook for the rest of the year. . Okay. So on the next slide, let's talk about that revised outlook. Steve mentioned we are moving up our expectations for revenues versus the guidance we provided two months ago. Those of you that have followed the company for a while know that we prefer to be cautious with these razors earlier in the year. I think the strong win has helped performance in Q1, driven by account wins, sets us up for a great year -- but as I mentioned, we're going to monitor the impact of seasonality in the summer months, especially. The guide assumes steady ASPs in NIPT, some continued erosion in the carrier screening ASPs and the ASPs for kidney transplant and modest improvements from here in Signatera clinical reimbursement. That leaves plenty of scope for these assumptions to be conservative over the course of the year, but we think that's the appropriate forecast for now. We are leading the rest of the guide element and change. On gross margins, we are comfortable that the ASP trajectory and cost savings expected this year will bring us into the guided range of 41% to 44% for the full year. The operating expense plan remains on track, and cash burn is really similar in concept to the revenue guidance. We think there is certainly scope to outperform, and we want to see a progress come in on a couple of our initiatives this year before getting more aggressive on for. So in summary, we think we are off to a strong start this year and look forward to taking your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tejas Savant.\nTejas Savant: Maybe I'll start with 1 on the Signatera guideline decision commentary here, Steve. You talked about sort of the committee not sort of fully considering the CIRCULATE data. Can you just share some color on what sort of drives your confidence around that? And more importantly, the degree to which you're viewing the time lines for that guideline inclusion as a swing factor in your medium-term Signatera CRC estimates?\nSteven Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Tejas. So first, nothing in our guidance. We're really in our path to cash flow breakeven includes that we're going to get an NCCN deadline for CRC. So I mean, we're trucking ahead. We've got a lot of momentum both on volume and on ASP without having that upside in. Now with that said, of course, we set ourselves up here in really, I think, a very nice position with all of the data that Alex outlined. I think a lot of people probably didn't realize that we have randomized trials that are going to be reading out sort of towards the end of this year. And then the Altera trial, which we think is going to be reading out in 2024. I mean, certainly, that will put us in a very, very strong position. As far as the 2022 vote is concerned, we've confirmed that at the time of the CIRCULATE study, the GALAXY study was not considered but it was included in the discussion section, which was written several months after the vote occurred. So I think that's sort of in line with what we expected as we realized that the GALAXY study wasn't going to be published before the August 2022 meeting, that's what we've been saying, I think, now in the last 3 earnings calls with respect to timing. . Now what happens going forward from here? We do know there's another meeting in August. We can't say exactly what's going to happen out there, meaning it's good that GALAXY is now published and can be formally considered. But certainly, we've backstopped future decisions with all of the new data that's coming out and the suite of randomized trials.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda.\nPuneet Souda: So first one is on ASP and maybe Mike can address some of this. Mike, could you talk a little bit about ASP both on the women's health side of the business as well as Signatera. Sort of what are sort of the trend lines here in terms of improvements? We were seeing some impact on carrier testing. So maybe just talk about that. And how should we think about the ASP overall?\nMichael Brophy: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first on Signatera, we're ahead of schedule put simply on the ASPs. We've talked a lot in the past about what are the components for drivers of the Signatera clinical ASP and it's always a function of that product being -- so pretty early days in launch and that ASP being quite immature relative to the price points that we for the product. So I think previously, we had set the expectation that we would kind of exit this year with an ASP for clinical Signatera in the 800s or will be in front of us. We actually got there in Q1, as I think Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So from here, not it's not really a reason in our mind why we would see that retrench. I think the guide contemplates kind of modest improvement from here. And we hope that we can keep that traction billing for all the reasons that we've talked about on this call and previously. And it's principally volume mix between initial and recurring time point. increasing concentration of our volumes in these tumor types but we have a Medicare reimbursed speechead, increased traction of the business coming from Medicare reimbursed patients, particularly in colorectal cancer. Just to name a few, in addition to the kind of new reimbursed tumor types and now getting some commercial coverage. So lots of good drivers there. On the women health side, ex California, and I think ASPs were strong. They were -- we sequentially grew them in the quarter. So I was encouraged by that. We knew and Steve talked about this prepared remarks that in order to stay in California, we would take -- we would take a penalty on blended ASP there, but we wanted to stay in the state because we feel like the long-term rationale for being there, both clinically and for the business. And as Steve mentioned, that we're cautiously have to be taken off the way that has trended so far. The guide contemplates a little bit more erosion on the care screen front. And that just goes back to the fact that we've actually kind of leaned into this previously talked about headwind that we're seeing on the care reimbursement. As a few competitors have exited the market, we've actually opted to take share there because we think the clinical utility and the guidelines are actually quite strong and it's table for us to improve the reimbursement profile in that business. And that's something that we'd like to see progress on here in the calendar year. So I know that's a lot, but those are kind of the main drivers of [indiscernible] in Natera. Overall, I'm encouraged about the ASP trajectory in this business as you look out '23 into '24.\nSteven Chapman: I'll just add too, even with the best that we've taken in sort of some of the temporary initiatives where we traded off volume for margin, we're still keeping our guidance intact for margins for the year of 41% to 44%, which we think is very strong. So things are actually looking very positive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte.\nThomas Peterson: This is actually Tom Peterson on for Catherine. Good to hear about progress with commercial payers on the Signatera front. I guess what additional progress are you contemplating for the remainder of the year? And have you made any additional progress in States where we've seen genetic testing legislation in past?\nSteven Chapman: Yes. So I think one of -- there's definitely a big opportunity in commercial coverage for Signatera that we think is going to come in over time. It all starts with having very strong peer-reviewed data. And that's where we really have an extensive leadership position, I think, now with more than 40 peer-reviewed papers. And you can see from some of the slides that Alex showed -- it's not just expansion into commercial payers for colorectal, but we still have a long way to go with the MolDX program and with Medicare. I think we've said we might be able to do seven or eight new MolDX submissions this year based on the strength of the data that we're putting out. So certainly, that's an expansion opportunity as well as what we're seeing on the commercial side. On the commercial side, I think it's great that we are seeing this traction and we're seeing some of the bipartisan legislation supporting expanded access for everyone. We've seen several more states now sort of put this legislation in place. I think the kind of back end of us filing the appeals and getting paid is still at the very early stages. So it's hard to really comment at this point on what the impact is going to be overall in the commercial plans. But the good news, the legislation continues. I think we're seeing progress. We're seeing an increased number of states adopting the positive led solution. And then again, we see plans like Blue Shield that have done their own economic analysis and determined that it makes sense to add coverage for Signatera, which is great, and I think there'll be a little bit more of that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julia Qin.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Marta on for Julia. I just wanted to ask, you recently got the CMS coverage for Signatera in breast, have you seen any meaningful impact in terms of uptick testing volume from that extension? And if not, when do you expect to be in? And how should we think about it for the rest of the year?\nSteven Chapman: Yes, that's a great question. So we've actually been seeing an increase in breast at the kind of proportion of the business for a while because there's first breast is a very big opportunity. When you just look at the number of patients that are available. Second, we think there's very high clinical utility. And third is we have incredible performance data, very, very strong performance data in breast in both adjuvant and recurrence monitoring setting and now in the neoadjuvant setting in both of those settings or all of those settings, we have initially published a smaller data set, and we've now followed those initial publications up with extensive data sets that include roughly 300 patients and well more than 1,000 time points. So this very strong data, combined with the coverage, combined with the operational execution is leading to an increase in the number of tests that are coming in. I think that's a very good sign.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan.\nDaniel Brennan: Great. Maybe two parter. Just on the neoadjuvant opportunity, it sounded like the I-SPY data, you kind of commented could generate reimbursement, but I know you also cited your coordinating with the team there to make Signatera prospective biomarker in future studies. So can you just kind of give us a sense of what the plans are for finally for coverage in neoadjuvant in terms of timing and data and kind of what the impact could be? And then just secondly, on the women's side, just on 22q in carrier screening, can you just remind us like -- I know they're not in guidance, but assuming if they were to come through, how do we think about the potential impact when that happens?\nSteven Chapman: Yes. So on the I-SPY study in the neoadjuvant setting, I think it is definitely one of the settings that we think has a very high clinical utility where we have very strong data now with new publication with 283 patients and 1,024 plasmic time points. So this is one of the biggest breast studies that's ever read out for donor-derived cell-free DNA, and we do plan on submitting this to MolDx for coverage in the very near future. When it comes to the opportunities in women's health, look, I think we sort of look at this as an opportunity to expand access to more patients. And any time you generate the type of data that we've generated that shows exceptionally high clinical utility for tests. Like, for example, in the SMART study for 22q, we showed that we could with very high sensitivity, very high specificity and a positive predicted value, which was really incredible to sort of 50% range, we could test for this disorder that affects roughly one in 1,500 pregnancies. So any time you're generating that type of data it is the type of thing that guideline committees are going to look at. And we think that's great because it expands access for patients and I think helps bring the test to those patients that may not otherwise have access. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Nowak.\nAlexander Nowak: All right. Great. I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the kidney headwinds you're facing the MolDx coverage change. You said physicians are working through it. The headwind is tracking to your expectations. So I guess just to expand on how is the reimbursement change just impacting testing in the field? What would the guidance have been without that headwind? And then, just how does this long term change your outlook on the viability of the transplant testing market?\nSteven Chapman: So I think anytime there's a change or clarification coming from Medicare? It just causes some sort of confusion with respect to what it actually means, what physicians should do? Do they need to make any change at all. And I think there's a sort of swirl of misinformation out there. Of course, that just causes some volume disruption. And I think as we're kind of working through that we're seeing that maybe things have been misinterpreted in various places. And I think the good thing for us is, I guess, one of the biggest changes that was announced was that you can't get reimbursed for RNA and cell-free DNA testing at the same time on the same patient. And that was never part of Natera's strategy. And I think that's probably the biggest change that has occurred. And so we weren't impacted by that at all. So we're really just impacted by this sort of slight volume disruption, I don't know I'd say maybe in the kind of 15% to 20% range of where accounts have sort of just kind of stopped ordering or temporarily push pause while they sort of work through things. Now for us, the revenue from donor-derived cell-free DNA testing, kidney business, I think is sort of mid-single digits when it comes to kind of the overall book of business. So it's a very tiny fraction of our overall revenue. And I think that disruption is offset now by the new revenue that we're seeing coming in from Prospera heart in many ways, not completely offset, but we do have a nice ramp in heart now that that's reimbursed that is helping to offset things. But of course, you're seeing that we raised our guidance. So overall, the broader company is growing nicely even though we did see the sort of 15% to 20% pullback in the kidney claims.\nAlexander Nowak: Great.\nSteven Chapman: Sorry, there's a second part there. I think what do we think overall about the business. Look, we have a lot of different opportunities organ health that we think are very positive. I think the proactive trial is reading out in June. I think that's going to be good for the entire industry. There's going to be some great information there. that support donor-derived cell-free DNA, overall. I think all these new guidelines that have come out like really in the last six months, we've now seen four strong society guidelines that didn't exist before. And I think that creates an opportunity to expand volume, I think, potentially of coverage reassessed and maybe get into sort of commercial coverage in the future. And then, of course, in the last couple of calls, we've been talking more about Renasight. We think that's a great opportunity to really change how chronic kidney disease patients are treated, and we think that potentially could have very high clinical utility, and we're looking forward to the readout of the RenaCARE study later this summer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Westenberg.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi this is Johan[ph] on for Dave. Can you give any comment on what the gross margin might have been if accounting for the California NIPT and the expanded carrier screening headwinds?\nSteven Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Brophy: Yes sure. So -- yes, I think gross margins would have been at least higher without those, but I think it's a little bit hard to just separate out those two things because those two events have also caused some disruption in the marketplace I think is temporary, and we are kind of leaning into that as one of the market leaders is going to take a share. So it's hard to take credit for some of the account wins and then turn around and say, well, yes, you would have gotten the gross margin? I mean there's a penalty to be there. And so we're going to now in return for to have a longer-term benefit that we think that you can see as early as they were this year and going into next year. So we feel really good about that play. I mean I think without those and maybe I'll just include kind of the third kind of the press onwards with continues to impair growth. I think gross margins would have been kind of in the range that you've seen in the last year so from us. So it's very intentional move on our part, and we think it's quite constructive for the long term of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liza Garcia.\nUnidentified Analyst: So congratulations for another great volume print on Signatera. So another Signatera question for you. But you guys have been doing really, really well. It obviously plans to kind of ad indications, which kind of drive new volumes with that, I think, more exome testing. And so if you can just kind of see qualitatively to kind of how to think about that on the margin side? And obviously, you alluded to how still you're not really getting that exon benefit, right, from the shift in kind of how you're doing your exome testing and really kind of how to think about the 2023 margins and kind of heading into 2024 on the oncology side, that would be great, kind of in there a little bit.\nSteven Chapman: Yes. So I'll comment first and then maybe, Mike, you can jump in. Yes. So on the exome side, any time we get a new patient for Signatera, we've run an exome and that's one of the more expensive parts of the protocol that does lead to increased COGS. And we've had various projects underway to reduce the COGS but still deliver the same very high-quality information for physicians. And we're kind of midstream on that. I think most of the work there is going to be executed in sort of the '23 time frame, but there's still going to be some opportunity there as we expand beyond that. But look, I mean, the volume is growing very quickly. And you also have to focus on scaling up, while at the same time, you're focusing on COGS reduction. Across the company as a whole, we have an extensive amount COGS reduction projects that are underway. And I'll just give you sort of some basic insight on some of these. I mean, one is as simple as moving the Panorama tabs from the NextSeq to the NovaSeq, right? So that obviously saves a decent amount on a per sample basis. That's a project that now is going to be applied across more than 1 million Panorama tests that are being run. So obviously, as we get sort of per sample savings because we do sequencing costs that's applied across the very large base of NIPT samples. So there's all types of projects like that. We have 4 or 5 pretty big COGS projects that each are in the range of sort of $5 million to $20 million in savings on an annualized basis. And executing those, none of which really require like an extreme amount of sort of new research, they really just require kind of the development work of integrating things within the LIMS system, doing the standard kind of verification validation studies and then launching, those are all part of our road to getting the business to cash flow breakeven. Again, on the margin side, it's sort of both COGS and ASP. And you can see some of the card projects are hitting this year some of the ASP projects are hitting this year, and that's how we're getting into that range of the kind of 41% to 44% by the end of the year. And then just as a reminder, in order for us to hit that we really don't need any of these big milestones that are out there like getting 22q guidance from ACOG or getting NCCN guidelines for colorectal or really seeing a sort of drastic improvements on expanded carrier shrink.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. We would like to thank everyone for their time today and have a pleasant rest of your day.",

            "name": "John Fesko",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. As a reminder, we also have a chronic kidney disease genetic testing product line, Renasight. Renasight looks at conditions like polycystic kidney disease, or Alport syndrome, in germline DNA of those patients who have already been diagnosed with CKD. In the future, we think every patient who is diagnosed with CKD could get genetic testing. The market opportunity is potentially very large because over one million patients in the U.S. are diagnosed each year, and there are about 37 million patients in the U.S. living with CKD. To help define the clinical utility of genetic testing in this context, Natera sponsored the definitive RenaCARE study. We started working on this in 2019 and collaborated with leading investigators from Colombia, Yale, Penn, UPMC, NYU, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic and others to design the study. We completed enrollment last year with more than 1,600 patients from over 30 centers. The RenaCARE study is designed to eases the incidence of genetic conditions in the CKD population and then importantly, how Renasight's genetic findings could impact clinical management. Some have asked us what success looks like in the RenaCARE state. While we're waiting to publish the results, the best proxy we found is hereditary cancer testing. We talked about this last quarter, but I think it's an instructive comparison. The previous large study of nearly 3,000 cancer patients published in general oncology, 13.3% of patients had a pathogenic germline variant indicating hereditary cancer. Of those patients with a high penetrance variants had resulting treatment modifications. At RenaCARE reached out, we will be looking at these same metrics, including the fraction of study participants who have a pathogenic variant associated with CKD as well as what fraction of patients who test positive had their treatment modified after the pathogenic variant is discovered with Renasight, stay tuned for more information over time. Okay. Let's dive into some of the oncology trends on the next slide. We covered the strong overall volume growth at the top of the call. The growth in our clinical oncology volumes in Q1 is actually masked somewhat by a lumpiness in our pharma volumes that favor Q4. Typically, pharma companies will order a larger number of tests in Q4 and as they need to utilize excess budget for the year. Our clinical volumes were actually up roughly 17% sequentially just since Q4 of 2022, and we've seen continued strong momentum so far in Q2. We are continuing to concentrate on the core indications where we have Medicare reimbursement. More than 80% of our volumes are now coming from covered indications. We were also really pleased to see ASPs make a meaningful step up in Q1 from the mid-700s to the low 800s, which we estimate was driven by the mix of time points ordered and some incremental benefit of breast reimbursement. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we think there are some opportunities to improve our collections within covered indications, expanded to new indications and drive more commercial coverage as well. On that note, our first commercial coverage policies in March. The recent decision from Blue Shield of California is a good case study for the kind of progress we are making with commercial plans for are increasingly appreciating the clinical and economic utility that Signatera offers. The fact that this was a pan-tumor coverage policy highlights the breadth of our data across a number of cancer types, which we think is a key differentiator. In addition to Blue Shield of California, we also secured coverage from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana for serial testing with Signatera for plan members diagnosed with colorectal cancer, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and pan cancer IO therapy monitoring. We think there's momentum on commercial coverage, and we look forward to seeing how things progress. Right before I turn it over to Alex, I want to briefly touch on our IP portfolio. As we've discussed in the past, we have a broad portfolio of MRD IP, only a small portion of which has been deployed in litigation. The remainder is not yet in play as we assess how things evolve. With that, I will now turn it over to Alex to review our oncology data in more detail. Alex?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Alexey Aleshin",
            "content": "Thanks, John. First, let me provide some detail on the data road map in colorectal cancer. As we predicted, Signatera was not included in the updated NCCN guidelines that were published this spring. This is because the CIRCULATE Galaxy paper published in January and was unavailable for the NCCN systemic evidence review process that occurred prior to the August meeting and therefore, was not included in the committee vote. Nevertheless, we are pleased to see that the 18-month real-world prospective data merit an inclusion in the discussion section of the updated guidelines and that Signatera was acknowledged as having prognostic and predictive value. Now that the CIRCULATE GALAXY data has been published and highlighted on the cover of Nature Medicine, we plan to submit the peer reviewed data in time for the 2023 systemic evidence review. While it's possible that the GALAXY study may be sufficient to change NCCN guidelines, we know that the NCCN committee referenced the need for more data in both the adjuvant and surveillance study. The good news is that this data is already coming. There's a randomized biobank study in the adjuvant setting that is expected to read out later this year, followed by the prospective Altera data expected in 2024, which would address both the adjuvant and surveillance questions. Furthermore, the randomized de-escalation arms of the Japan and U.S. CIRCULATE continue to enroll out. with the readouts currently anticipated in 2026. There are also several nonrandomized trials that we expect will be at the field, including a large commercial experience study that will be submitted for publication later this year, extended follow-up from the GALAXY study, plus the BESPOKE trial where enrollment is now complete and which has relevant endpoints in both adjuvant and surveillance settings. With these many shots on goal, we believe we're in a good position. Additionally, it's worth noting that this list is far from expensive. As it does not include other independent clinical utility studies being conducted on Signatera by multiple institutions that are now beginning to read out. Given that we started working on these trials years ago, some dating back as far as six or seven years, we think this pipeline creates a significant competitive advantage going forward. While the CRC data pipeline has been advancing. We continue to make significant progress across multiple other indications. Here, you see six studies with large patient cohorts and more than 500 plasma time points each, either recently published or on the near-term road map. We think that the data from these studies could support clinical adoption and serve as the basis for additional submissions to Medicare. The gastroesophageal in anal cancer papers are highly relevant to GI oncologists who order Signatera and CRC. This is also true for pancreatic cancer, where we are planning to submit for publication a real-world study with more than 300 patients and 1,900 time points. Data that opens new avenues for risk stratifying and managing these patients. For example, the surgery for pancreatic cancer can be extremely more that -- and our data suggests that Signatera may allow for more personalized selection of patients for either surgical or medical management faired disease. We've also had a particular focus on developing data in breast cancer given the scale of the unmet need. So the recent coverage decision we achieved in this histology is a major win for us. Building on our landmark BLISS study published in 2019 and in CCR, we are now following up with an expanded cohort, examining 3x more patients and 5x more plasma time points with significantly longer follow-up. This expanded data was presented at ASCO in 2022 and has already been submitted for publication. And of course, we are very pleased to get the publication out or the ISPY-2 neoadjuvant breast cancer data. We think neoadjuvant breast cancer represents a strong use case for Signatera, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. First, let me tell you about the neoadjuvant setting and how patients are treated today. Up to 50% of all breast cancer patients now get neoadjuvant treatment, which is a growing trend, and it describes any systemic treatment that is rendered before definitive surgery. This can include any combination of the following: chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy or immune therapy. The purpose of neoadjuvant therapy is three. The first is to decrease the risk of distant recurrence; the second is to downstage the tumor to allow for more effective surgery; and the third is to assess treatment response in order to guide adjuvant therapy. However, there are several unmet clinical needs in the neoadjuvant setting. Namely, it's hard to know if the adjuvant therapy is working and if certain patients can avoid or shorten the duration of toxic chemotherapy. The NCCN guidelines themselves state explicitly that accurate assessment of response to new adjuvant therapy is difficult. So there is an opportunity for Signatera to fundamentally change management here. Now let's go over the data. In the study, 28 patients with over 1,000 plasma time points were analyzed. TTA status and trajectory during neoadjuvant therapy were found to be significant predictors of metastatic recurrence or death in HR-positive, HER2-negative as well as triple-negative patients. As you can see on the slide, patients who have a CTA negative after neoadjuvant therapy, has improved survival even when a residual disease was detected at the time of surgery. This is a big deal. Since these patients are being treated with aggressive adjuvant regimen, in the postoperative setting, which may not be necessary. Additionally, in triple-negative breast cancer, this effect could be observed even earlier. As soon as just a few weeks after neoadjuvant therapy was initiated, suggesting that if a patient was to clear their CKA after just one or two cycles, they may be eligible for deescalation of their neoadjuvant regimen and potentially avoid certain forms of additional adjuvant chemotherapy. The second significant finding was that patients were CTA negative at tZERO. This is a time point before new adjuvant therapy was initiated, had exceptionally favorable long-term outcome with significantly improved relative distant recurrence free survival compared to patients who are Signatera-positive at that time point. This is very powerful, indicating that CTA negativity and diagnosis may identify a favorable subgroup of patients that in the future may be managed much less aggressively in terms of the intensity of their chemotherapy, surgery or their radiation treatments. We believe this data can support reimbursement in the neoadjuvant setting and help accelerate the general adoption of neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer patients. It also enables an earlier entry point for patients into the Signatera ecosystem, right at diagnosis, which then allows for seamlessly monitoring these patients after surgery. The data you're seeing today is the result of an incredible amount of time and effort as we initiated our relationship with I-SPY Consortium way back in 2015. As a next step, we are now coordinating with the I-SPY team. to make Signatera a prospectively integrated biomarker in their future studies. Finally, we've kept a busy academic conference schedule this season with a number of key studies being presented at AACR last month, and more being planned to be presented at ASCO in June. Let me highlight a few significant data sets that may be of particular importance for our program going forward. At AACR, we have five poster presentations including new data in esophogastric as well as muscle-invasive bladder cancer, highlighting the utility of Signatera in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant leadings. At ASCO, there will be significant new data spanning across two oral and at least 12 poster presentations. I want to highlight just a few of these studies. The first being a poster discussion of the INTERCEPT program being conducted by MD Anderson. This poster reports on the clinical utility Signatera in the surveillance setting of CRC. Additionally, we look forward to the readout from the Empower 1 study being sponsored by Regeneron in non-small cell lung cancer, which we think will demonstrate the predictive nature of CTA dynamics in patients receiving immune therapy. We know that non-small cell lung cancer remains the largest market for immune therapy use with upwards of 60% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. receiving an IO containing regimen. Lastly, updated data from CIRCULATE Japan, including a focus on the role of CTA dynamics in predicting an adjuvant therapy benefit and risk of recurrence will also be present. Finally, I want to provide a brief update on our ECD program. We continue to make good progress in developing blood-only early cancer detection assay, first for colorectal cancer and later for multi-cancer. We are completing a case-control study that should read out by the end of the year with a presentation to follow thereafter. We remain committed to prudent investment into this program, as we've said before, we will provide updates if and when a significant inflection in spending is warranted. With that, let me hand the call over to Mike to review the financial results. Mike?"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Steven Chapman",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. As you can see from the highlights, we are off to a very strong start as we continue to drive robust financial performance maintain our leadership position in cell-free DNA analysis and achieve important milestones across the business. We process roughly 626,000 tests in the quarter, up 28% from Q1 of last year and 12% sequentially versus Q4. We generated $242 million in revenues in the quarter, which was a major increase, both versus Q4 and year-on-year. We also saw strong volume growth. We performed 71,000 Signatera and Altera test in the quarter, which is more than 100% growth versus Q1 of last year. We saw a very strong step-up in clinical volumes over Q4 of last year and is generating continued momentum this spring. As a result, we are pleased to be raising our annual revenue guide that we just set two months ago. We are moving to a new range of $995 million to $1.015 billion for the year. The rest of the elements of the guide will remain the same for now. We are on pace to hit our margin target of 41% to 44% and hit our reduced cash burn target of $300 million to $325 million. You will see our quarterly cash burn in Q1 cut almost in half versus Q1 2022, and we feel we're on track for our 2024 cash flow breakeven goal that we previously announced. In addition, we've been conservative with the impact of guidelines for 22q and expanded carrier screening and MRD testing in our ASP forecast. Note that these guidelines are not necessary to achieve our financial goals. We continue to extend our leadership position in women's health with two significant NIPT publications in a third paper that has been accepted for publication. We now have more than 40 published peer-reviewed papers highlighting the performance of our Panorama NIPT including the landmark SMART study. We think this clinical differentiation continues to be an important volume driver as the NIPT market continues to grow. Of course, we've had a string of wins for Signatera this spring as well. We continued our data leadership with several presentations at AACR, and we are very excited to announce two oral and 12 poster presentations that are out of this June. In addition, a new study demonstrated Signatera's performance in Stages three and four melanoma and the expanded I-SPY 2 study demonstrated the value of Signatera for breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. We think the neoadjuvant breast setting is important, and we will dig into that later in the call. After securing Medicare coverage for breast cancer in March, we were pleased to receive the major commercial coverage decision for Signatera with a pan tumor coverage policy from Blue Shield of California. In Oregon Health, we secured Medicare reimbursement for Prospera in heart transplantation. We haven't included this in the guidance originally. So this is a nice win. In kidney, in line with our expectations, we are seeing some modest disruption of the updated Medicare policy. But as you can see from the results in the guide, this isn't making an impact in the context of our overall business. especially with the upside from heart reimbursement now coming in. I'll get into more details a bit later in the call. Okay, great. Let me get into some of the business trends. We've more than tripled the quarterly volume since the beginning of 2019 and our growth rates remain in the mid-20s despite the significant increase in the scale of a business. I think that gives a sense of the commercial execution track record and shows that we are offering critical services is in very large patient populations. You can also see that Q1 historically represents a big step up over the prior year and 2023 has proven to be no different. This is driven in part by the seasonal patterns of NIPT favor in Q1, but also shows our ongoing success in taking market share and represents a continuation of the broader shift from maternal serum screening to NIPT. As a reminder, we think NIPT is only about 50% penetrated today. This year, our Q1 volume growth was further amplified by three strategies we have been pursuing that increased volume for the long term but we expect it would impact gross margins this year. One was our decision to continue operating in California and to participate in the prenatal screening program and into effect last fall when most lab providers opted to not participate. California initially required patients to go through the state program. Despite the low margin of the state's limited NIPT offering, we thought it was important to provide access for this patient population. However, after a legal challenge, the courts have now allowed NIPT to be offered outside of the state program, enabling us to regain some of the lost margin while increasing our volumes. So we're optimistic that we made the right decision to stay. The second was our decision to serve many new carrier screening customers after competitors exited the space last fall. Many of these customers are high-volume accounts and they have a preference for the broader carrier screening panels that currently have a very low margin profile. We opted to take on many of these accounts because we feel the clinical utility and guideline support for broad screening is strong, and we hope to see reimbursement rates improve as we go into 2024. The third is our decision to continue driving Signatera volumes because of the growth ramp and the upfront expense, Signature's margin profile is lower than our overall company margin. However, we expect that delta to narrow as we continue to lower COGS and increase ASP through various initiatives. Obviously, growing Signatera is the right decision as we are still in the very early days in oncology. We have established a strong competitive advantage for Signatera, particularly with the extensive body of peer review data we generated, which is now leading to strong uptake and more coverage. With each of these strategies, there was a trade-off between short-term gross margins and the future upside potential. Despite these volume bets, we've significantly improved our cash burn trajectory by continuing to grow top line revenue on top of now much lower operating expenses. You see this happening with our net cash burn reduction in Q1. Our aggressive cash burn goal is remaining intact and our strong gross margin guidance of 41% to 44% for the year. And again, we've been conservative with the potential upside for future society guidelines, which could boost things further. The next slide demonstrates the strong volume trends are translating into revenue at roughly the same pace. And as we just mentioned, we think there is upside on 22q broad panel carrier screening and Signatera clinical volumes. As we described in detail in March, we were very pleased to see strong updates to the ACMG guidelines on 22q. On ACOG guidelines, we think the data published in SMART are compelling. We're hopeful for a positive update soon, but of course, we don't have direct insight into the guideline process. With carrier screening off the back of favorable existing ACMG ACOG guidelines, we're seeing payers start to change their policies, which we think is a good sign. In oncology, we are very pleased to see sequential progress in our Signatera clinical ASPs moving from the mid-700s in Q4 to the low 800s in Q1. This trend was driven largely by incremental progress in our Medicare and recurrence monitoring mix with a smaller benefit coming from breast coverage. So for Signatera, we are ahead of schedule on our reimbursement trajectory, and we remain optimistic that we can see continued improvement over the course of '23. For clarity, we're not dependent on NCCN guidelines to give the ASP to a much stronger place Also, the signatory gross margin benefit from improvements in ASP was offset by the fact that we haven't yet gotten the full COGS benefit on the tissue exome, which is a benefit we expect to realize this year progresses. The next slide gets into the compelling new publications on our Panorama NIPT. As a reminder, Panorama represents around 50% of the NIPT market in the United States with differentiated capabilities, they're supported by more than 40 peer-reviewed publications. This includes SMART, the largest prospective multicenter NIPT study, where we clinically validated Panorama's performance in over 18,000 pregnancies with genetic outcomes confirmed for all samples analyzed in the study. With recent publications, we are continuing to add to the body of evidence. The first published in obstetrics and gynecology evaluated patients who receive a rare Panorama result that could indicate suspected material malignancy. We show that when Panorama sees a very specific type of DNA pattern, more than two third of the time, these patients have maternal cancer. The PPV of 67% is quite high, so doctors seeing this result are advised to investigate further. It's an extremely rare finding but one that could provide important and potentially life-saving clinical information for these patients and their doctors. The second is a new publication from SMART published in [indiscernible]. This publication found that in a subcategory of about 1 in 200 patients, Panorama was able to determine a significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. These patients were 4x more likely to have preeclampsia and 4x to 10x more likely to have preterm birth. In these patients, panorama may provide important information about increased risk for adverse outcome which could ultimately help doctors to more closely manage these pregnancies at high risk. Finally, we learned that another publication was accepted from SMART by genetics in medicine. This is the largest prospective clinical validation of screening for sex chromosome and employees with NIPT across over 17,000 pregnancies in a real-world setting, Panorama's performance when screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies was excellent. As we are seeing, the SMART study continues to yield critical new insights about NIPT and the real-world performance of Panorama. As the market expands, we think our strong data leadership continue to differentiate Panorama from other NIPTs. Okay. Let me transition over to Oregon Health. As I mentioned, we were pleased to secure Medicare reimbursement for Prospera in heart transplant. We hadn't originally included this in our guidance because we can't always predict when coverage will come in. Many of you will recall that we launched Prospera in heart ahead of reimbursement. So now that we're covered, we're already off to a running start with a nice volume ramp. We also have additional data count from the NIH-sponsored prospective DTRT study, which we think will be published later this year. So we're feeling really good about our trajectory in parts. Also in heart, but extending to kidney as well, we were pleased to see medical society endorsements of donor-derived cell-free DNA testing from the ASTS and AST in addition to recent endorsements from ISHLT and ESOT. These guidelines and statements could serve as the basis for further volume growth where today, the markets are very underpenetrated. On kidney, we've seen modest disruption in the transplant volumes as physicians worked out how to implement new Medicare policy. Some of the disruption is based on confusion surrounding the policy, which we think will resolve itself over time and some represents a slight shift in ordering patterns. The magnitude of the addition is in line with our expectations and it's offset somewhat by the upside from our heart coverage. As you can see from our raised revenue guidance, this isn't making a material impact on our overall trajectory. Looking ahead, the recent society endorsements provide a potential path to expand access and increase penetration. Plus, we've got new data from the now fully enrolled proactive trial that we think could help further expand patient access. The first readout will be at ATC in June. We think it's impressive data that can benefit the entire industry in support of donor-derived cell-free DNA testing, so we look forward to sharing it with the community. Now let me turn it over to John Fesko, Chief Business Officer, to give a few additional updates on chronic kidney disease in oncology. John? Yes. Thanks, Tejas. So first, nothing in our guidance. We're really in our path to cash flow breakeven includes that we're going to get an NCCN deadline for CRC. So I mean, we're trucking ahead. We've got a lot of momentum both on volume and on ASP without having that upside in. Now with that said, of course, we set ourselves up here in really, I think, a very nice position with all of the data that Alex outlined. I think a lot of people probably didn't realize that we have randomized trials that are going to be reading out sort of towards the end of this year. And then the Altera trial, which we think is going to be reading out in 2024. I mean, certainly, that will put us in a very, very strong position. As far as the 2022 vote is concerned, we've confirmed that at the time of the CIRCULATE study, the GALAXY study was not considered but it was included in the discussion section, which was written several months after the vote occurred. So I think that's sort of in line with what we expected as we realized that the GALAXY study wasn't going to be published before the August 2022 meeting, that's what we've been saying, I think, now in the last 3 earnings calls with respect to timing. . Now what happens going forward from here? We do know there's another meeting in August. We can't say exactly what's going to happen out there, meaning it's good that GALAXY is now published and can be formally considered. But certainly, we've backstopped future decisions with all of the new data that's coming out and the suite of randomized trials. I'll just add too, even with the best that we've taken in sort of some of the temporary initiatives where we traded off volume for margin, we're still keeping our guidance intact for margins for the year of 41% to 44%, which we think is very strong. So things are actually looking very positive. Yes. So I think one of -- there's definitely a big opportunity in commercial coverage for Signatera that we think is going to come in over time. It all starts with having very strong peer-reviewed data. And that's where we really have an extensive leadership position, I think, now with more than 40 peer-reviewed papers. And you can see from some of the slides that Alex showed -- it's not just expansion into commercial payers for colorectal, but we still have a long way to go with the MolDX program and with Medicare. I think we've said we might be able to do seven or eight new MolDX submissions this year based on the strength of the data that we're putting out. So certainly, that's an expansion opportunity as well as what we're seeing on the commercial side. On the commercial side, I think it's great that we are seeing this traction and we're seeing some of the bipartisan legislation supporting expanded access for everyone. We've seen several more states now sort of put this legislation in place. I think the kind of back end of us filing the appeals and getting paid is still at the very early stages. So it's hard to really comment at this point on what the impact is going to be overall in the commercial plans. But the good news, the legislation continues. I think we're seeing progress. We're seeing an increased number of states adopting the positive led solution. And then again, we see plans like Blue Shield that have done their own economic analysis and determined that it makes sense to add coverage for Signatera, which is great, and I think there'll be a little bit more of that as well. Yes, that's a great question. So we've actually been seeing an increase in breast at the kind of proportion of the business for a while because there's first breast is a very big opportunity. When you just look at the number of patients that are available. Second, we think there's very high clinical utility. And third is we have incredible performance data, very, very strong performance data in breast in both adjuvant and recurrence monitoring setting and now in the neoadjuvant setting in both of those settings or all of those settings, we have initially published a smaller data set, and we've now followed those initial publications up with extensive data sets that include roughly 300 patients and well more than 1,000 time points. So this very strong data, combined with the coverage, combined with the operational execution is leading to an increase in the number of tests that are coming in. I think that's a very good sign. Yes. So on the I-SPY study in the neoadjuvant setting, I think it is definitely one of the settings that we think has a very high clinical utility where we have very strong data now with new publication with 283 patients and 1,024 plasmic time points. So this is one of the biggest breast studies that's ever read out for donor-derived cell-free DNA, and we do plan on submitting this to MolDx for coverage in the very near future. When it comes to the opportunities in women's health, look, I think we sort of look at this as an opportunity to expand access to more patients. And any time you generate the type of data that we've generated that shows exceptionally high clinical utility for tests. Like, for example, in the SMART study for 22q, we showed that we could with very high sensitivity, very high specificity and a positive predicted value, which was really incredible to sort of 50% range, we could test for this disorder that affects roughly one in 1,500 pregnancies. So any time you're generating that type of data it is the type of thing that guideline committees are going to look at. And we think that's great because it expands access for patients and I think helps bring the test to those patients that may not otherwise have access. . So I think anytime there's a change or clarification coming from Medicare? It just causes some sort of confusion with respect to what it actually means, what physicians should do? Do they need to make any change at all. And I think there's a sort of swirl of misinformation out there. Of course, that just causes some volume disruption. And I think as we're kind of working through that we're seeing that maybe things have been misinterpreted in various places. And I think the good thing for us is, I guess, one of the biggest changes that was announced was that you can't get reimbursed for RNA and cell-free DNA testing at the same time on the same patient. And that was never part of Natera's strategy. And I think that's probably the biggest change that has occurred. And so we weren't impacted by that at all. So we're really just impacted by this sort of slight volume disruption, I don't know I'd say maybe in the kind of 15% to 20% range of where accounts have sort of just kind of stopped ordering or temporarily push pause while they sort of work through things. Now for us, the revenue from donor-derived cell-free DNA testing, kidney business, I think is sort of mid-single digits when it comes to kind of the overall book of business. So it's a very tiny fraction of our overall revenue. And I think that disruption is offset now by the new revenue that we're seeing coming in from Prospera heart in many ways, not completely offset, but we do have a nice ramp in heart now that that's reimbursed that is helping to offset things. But of course, you're seeing that we raised our guidance. So overall, the broader company is growing nicely even though we did see the sort of 15% to 20% pullback in the kidney claims. Sorry, there's a second part there. I think what do we think overall about the business. Look, we have a lot of different opportunities organ health that we think are very positive. I think the proactive trial is reading out in June. I think that's going to be good for the entire industry. There's going to be some great information there. that support donor-derived cell-free DNA, overall. I think all these new guidelines that have come out like really in the last six months, we've now seen four strong society guidelines that didn't exist before. And I think that creates an opportunity to expand volume, I think, potentially of coverage reassessed and maybe get into sort of commercial coverage in the future. And then, of course, in the last couple of calls, we've been talking more about Renasight. We think that's a great opportunity to really change how chronic kidney disease patients are treated, and we think that potentially could have very high clinical utility, and we're looking forward to the readout of the RenaCARE study later this summer. Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. So I'll comment first and then maybe, Mike, you can jump in. Yes. So on the exome side, any time we get a new patient for Signatera, we've run an exome and that's one of the more expensive parts of the protocol that does lead to increased COGS. And we've had various projects underway to reduce the COGS but still deliver the same very high-quality information for physicians. And we're kind of midstream on that. I think most of the work there is going to be executed in sort of the '23 time frame, but there's still going to be some opportunity there as we expand beyond that. But look, I mean, the volume is growing very quickly. And you also have to focus on scaling up, while at the same time, you're focusing on COGS reduction. Across the company as a whole, we have an extensive amount COGS reduction projects that are underway. And I'll just give you sort of some basic insight on some of these. I mean, one is as simple as moving the Panorama tabs from the NextSeq to the NovaSeq, right? So that obviously saves a decent amount on a per sample basis. That's a project that now is going to be applied across more than 1 million Panorama tests that are being run. So obviously, as we get sort of per sample savings because we do sequencing costs that's applied across the very large base of NIPT samples. So there's all types of projects like that. We have 4 or 5 pretty big COGS projects that each are in the range of sort of $5 million to $20 million in savings on an annualized basis. And executing those, none of which really require like an extreme amount of sort of new research, they really just require kind of the development work of integrating things within the LIMS system, doing the standard kind of verification validation studies and then launching, those are all part of our road to getting the business to cash flow breakeven. Again, on the margin side, it's sort of both COGS and ASP. And you can see some of the card projects are hitting this year some of the ASP projects are hitting this year, and that's how we're getting into that range of the kind of 41% to 44% by the end of the year. And then just as a reminder, in order for us to hit that we really don't need any of these big milestones that are out there like getting 22q guidance from ACOG or getting NCCN guidelines for colorectal or really seeing a sort of drastic improvements on expanded carrier shrink."

Following management's prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, November 12, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Michael Brophy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMike Brophy: Thanks Operator Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of 2024. On the line I am joined by Steve Chapman, our CEO, and Alexey Aleshin, General Manager of Oncology and Chief Medical Officer. Solomon Moshkevich, President, Clinical Diagnostics, couldn't be here today, but will be joining us again next quarter. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. We will be referring to a slide presentation that has been posted to investor.natera.com. A replay of the call will also be posted to our IR site as soon as it's available. Starting on slide two, during the course of this conference call we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our operational and financial outlook and projections, our assumptions for that outlook, market size, partnerships, clinical studies and expected results, opportunities and strategies and expectations for various current and future products including product capabilities, expected release dates, reimbursement coverage and related effects on our financial and operating results. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Form-10K or 10-Q and the Form-8K filed with today's press release. Those documents identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or suggested by forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, November 12, 2024. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Natera disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Thanks Mike. Let\u2019s get into the highlights on the next slide. 2024 has already been a transformational year for Natera and I think Q3 represents our best quarter yet. We generated $439.8 million in revenue, up 64% from the third quarter of last year, which represents a record quarter for revenue growth. Volumes continue to grow rapidly, up 24% year-over-year. We performed about 137,000 oncology tests in the quarter, which is up 54% from last year. Signatera Clinical Units posted another strong quarter, up 11.4 thousand units sequentially versus Q2. This is the third fastest quarter over quarter growth we've had since launch. We also grew record 48.4 thousand units year-on-year, which is the best quarter we've ever had in terms of growth units. Our gross margins were 62% in the quarter, again a record for us. And after breaking even on cash for a couple of quarters in a row, we generated $34.5 million in cash this quarter, which is of course another important milestone in our evolution. All of this puts us in a position to raise our guidance for the year. With revenue expectations now at $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, that implies about 50% revenue growth for the full year, which would be the fastest full year growth we've had as a public company and is significantly above our own internal expectations from the beginning of the year. Many of you saw the groundbreaking GALAXY data published in Nature Medicine and concurrently presented at ESMO in September, which delivered outstanding prospective overall survival data in MRD for the first time. We think this data is important because it strongly supports the core indication for MRD testing, adjuvant decision making and recurrence monitoring. In colorectal cancer physicians have moved beyond analytical metrics and clinical validation studies and now expect to see prospective outcomes data like this. As a reminder, this took us over four years to generate and we have a median of 24 months clinical follow up, with a good portion of patients having three years of follow up. I'm also pleased to announce the completion of a study using Signatera from the CALGB/SWOG 80702 trial, which is a randomized phase three study in CRC. These results have been accepted as a late breaking abstract for the ASCO GI Conference in January. As you saw from our press release, we see this trial as one of the most important in the space given its size, randomized design and indication. As a reminder, the trial is looking at whether Signatera can predict which patients will benefit from escalation of adjuvant therapy and will report on disease free survival and overall survival respectively. Similar to Altair, this will be another trial that is drug dependent and we look forward to sharing results in early 2025. We also expect results from the GSK ZEST trial in breast cancer will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Symposium next month. As a reminder, this trial was terminated in April of 2023 due to low trial enrollment, so it's underpowered. But we're still looking to see a trend towards improved disease free survival in MRD positive patients treated with niraparib versus placebo. Okay, let's get on to some of the business trends. The first slide shows Q3 volumes over time and despite the scale of the business, our growth continues to be very strong. In women's health over the past year, we saw significant growth from our direct channel augmented by the Invitae volume we added earlier this year. In addition, we launched our Fetal RhD test at a time of critical need in the prenatal community. We are really seeing strong demand for this test which can help physicians assess the need for medication traditionally given to RhD negative women to prevent potential complications in future pregnancies. As we've spoken about previously, having an RhD test and the timeliness of our launch was important given that OB-GYNs were facing limited supplies of this medication. The launch is also a great example of the passion and commitment of the Natera team rallying to help patients in need. We're excited about the future of the women's health business and we are working hard to help as many patients as possible get access to our differentiated suite of testing. We also had another excellent quarter in Oregon Health with strong volume growth year-on-year. The strength of our peer reviewed evidence and differentiated product pipeline is being received very well by physicians. We now have more than 45 peer reviewed papers in Oregon Health, including the largest prospective study published in the field to date. We look forward to continuing to serve physicians and patients as we move forward. On the next slide, we're double clicking on the Signatera clinical volumes. We processed 137,000 units in Q3, which includes 130,000 Signatera clinical volumes. This represents growth of about 11,400 units in the quarter, well above our average of between eight and 10,000 units. The volume was one of our best quarters of growth ever. Given sequential quarters tend to have some variability in terms of holidays and number of receiving days. It's also useful to look at the trend year-on-year. Q3 clinical units were 48.4 thousand higher this year compared to Q3 of last year, a record for the company. We're off to a great start in Q4 despite the impact of the hurricane and the trends are continuing to be very positive. Okay, the next slide shows total revenues year-on-year and a sequential quarter trend. We are very pleased to post 64% revenue growth year-on-year. We have $34.5 million in revenue true ups, which is lower than last quarter as expected, and Mike will talk more about that later in the call. Even stripping out those trips would have yielded a growth rate of 50%, which compares very favorably with our fastest growing quarters despite the fact that the revenue base has gotten much larger in the past few years. While the volumes are clearly providing a strong base for growth, ASP improvement continues to contribute to our revenue growth. We've seen progress across the board as we've worked hard to improve reimbursement for covered services in women's health and the Signatera ASP continues to improve. It's important to recall that we reached this level without getting any tailwinds for the Women's health guidelines. While we remain optimistic on guidelines for both carrier screening and 22Q, we plan to be successful with or without guidelines, and we're pleased to see that happening. Our growth in total company ASPs is also a function of our product mix evolving towards Signatera. That shift in product mix is fueling the evolution of our gross margins as shown here on the next slide. 62% gross margin is a record for us and well above our expectations at the beginning of the year. ASPs were once again very strong across all of our major products and we're pleased to see Signatera ASP step up modestly once again in the quarter compared to Q2. The COGS wins from the first half held steady in Q3 and we delivered a significant gross margin expansion over Q2. The true ups moderated slightly, down to just under $35 million this quarter. This represents excellent execution as the cash receipts exceeded our past expectations. Excluding true ups, underlying gross margins expanded considerably from roughly 55% gross margins in Q2 to over 58% gross margins in Q3. Again, that is driven by strong ASPs execution on COGS projects and the continuing mix shift in the business towards Signatera. While reimbursement can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we feel like we are very well positioned to continue to drive margins higher led by Signatera volumes and ASPs continuing to ramp. So accelerating revenues and gross margins coupled with cash collections well in excess of prior expectations are leading us to our first quarter of meaningful cash flow generation. The chart demonstrates quite a journey from Q1 of 2022 where we burned $162 million in a single quarter. The reality is that our strategy has remained the same throughout this timeframe depicted on the chart. We made the big investments required to deliver excellent care for patients and the volumes and reimbursement followed. While we've been very efficient with resources, we've gotten here without big cost cuts that jeopardize the future of our business. In fact, as Mike will cover in the guide, we've continued to invest in future growth by adding meaningful investments to our R&D and commercial teams. As we look into 2025, we will continue to prioritize innovation and customer service while managing to cash flow break even. We think that's the best approach for patients, for doctors and for the business given the size of the markets that we're in. With that, let me hand it over to Alex to provide an update on Oncology. Alex?\nAlexey Aleshin: Thanks Steve. I'm pleased to share some of the recent results from the GALAXY study in colorectal cancer, which we believe were universally excellent across the board, particularly on Signatera's ability to predict overall survival as well as adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in patients with CRC. As many of you know, GALAXY is part of the Circulate Platform study. We have presented a few datasets thus far which have focused on disease free survival since overall survival takes longer to mature. At the ESMO conference in September and published concurrently in Nature Medicine, we show for the first time an overall survival signal associated with Signatera in a prospective study. Given that overall survival is such an important metric for oncologists and the gold standard for clinical trials, we view this as a major milestone for the field. There are a few main points I want to highlight for you today. The first is that Signatera was predictive of overall survival. Patients who tested Signatera positive had a much worse prognosis than Signatera negative patients, around 10 times worse at 36 months. Furthermore, Signatera was the most significant predictor of recurrence as well as overall survival when compared to all known clinical pathological risk factors. The second point is that Signatera predicted an overall survival benefit from chemotherapy. The GALAXY results show that if a patient tested Signatera positive and received chemotherapy, they had a superior overall survival with a 50% lower risk of death versus patients who did not receive treatment. The study also demonstrated that patients who tested negative had no significant benefit from chemo in terms of OS, highlighting the potential for de-escalation of adjuvant therapy for a large portion of patients. And finally, we looked at Signatera clearance after adjuvant therapy. We showed that patients who cleared ctDNA and remained Signatera negative had superior outcomes with 24-month overall survival being 100%. In comparison, patients who did not achieve CTA clearance at 24 months had an OS of just 61%. These findings may allow for personalization of treatment and recurrence monitoring that we hope can fundamentally change how colorectal cancer is managed. So, in summary, we believe these results are incredibly significant and further expand the body of evidence supporting Signatera in CRC. Moving to the next slide, I'm also happy to provide an update on a key study in colorectal cancer. As per our press release earlier this morning, I'll first summarize the main points and why we believe this is such an important trial. To start, the study is drawn from the CALGB/SWOG 80702 study that we'll refer going forward as the 702 study, a randomized Phase III clinical trial in CRC, which evaluated the benefit of adding celecoxib to adjuvant chemotherapy in the postoperative management of patients with stage III colorectal cancer. Individuals in the study were randomized to either receive adjuvant chemotherapy plus placebo or adjuvant chemotherapy plus celecoxib. The original study results published in 2021 showed that the addition of celecoxib did not significantly improve disease free survival in patients with stage III colon cancer. However, that study was initially run without Signatera. The new analyses used samples from the 702 study to investigate whether Signatera can be utilized to identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from escalation of adjuvant therapy with the addition of celecoxib. This pre specified analysis included more than 1,000 patients with Signatera CTA status post-surgery, so it will be a sizable readout. We will report on Signatera's ability to predict DFS and OS benefit from the addition of celecoxib. The results have been accepted as a late breaking abstract for ASCO GI along with the results of the Altair study, but we look forward to sharing more details on both in late January. On this next slide we provide a bit more context on Celecoxib, also known as Celebrex which as I mentioned is a drug being investigated in this trial. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID, and as many of you are likely aware, NSAIDs are class of drugs like aspirin that can be used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation and bring down fevers. These medicines are widely available, relatively non-toxic and generally low cost. NSAIDs have also shown promise in benefiting certain subpopulations in CRC. For example, several studies suggest that NSAIDs reduce the risk of developing precancerous colon polyps. There's a clear need for additional adjuvant treatment options for patients with colorectal cancer as there has not been a new drug approval in this space for over 20 years. Our analysis will be the first randomized study to help address this unmet need and we are hopeful that Signatera can help open the door to effective treatment options in colorectal cancer personalized to patients who are most likely to benefit. And with that I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Brophy: Great. Thanks, Alex. The next slide is just a summary of the P&L in Q3 and the year-over-year progress. Steve covered the trends on revenues and gross margins, which, I think, is set in stark relief on this slide. We really are in a completely different place in terms of revenue scale and gross margins compared to where we were even just a year ago, which at the time was actually a very good result. R&D, we've grown as we've staffed up to accelerate the tempo of new product launches and additional clinical trials. SG&A has also stepped up meaningfully, although a significant chunk of the step-up is related to litigation expenses and noncash charges related to stock-based comp. We, of course, added the Invitae women's health sales team this year, and we've made steady investments in Signatera commercial operations through the course of the year. Despite all those investments, you'll note that the loss per share narrowed significantly as our strategy continues to play out. That's consistent with the positive cash flow generation we posted in the quarter that you see at the bottom of the slide. Related to the cash flow generation, I was very pleased to see the days sales outstanding dropped again dramatically to approximately 73 days in Q3 after hovering in the mid-90s range for several quarters previously. And after we had spiked to above 100 days during the first few quarters of Signatera growth. I wouldn't be surprised to see DSOs and quarterly cash bounce around a lot based on a typical working capital dynamic for our business but we are seeing clearly much more efficient conversion of our coverage services to cash after years of hard work with payers to make this happen. One other key subsequent event to mention is we are very pleased to retire the convertible notes that you actually see here on the slide. At the beginning of the pandemic when the shares were roughly $25, we issued the convertible notes as an insurance policy to make sure that we had cash available to survive whatever might happen as the world was shutting down. The notes don't mature until 2027, but we were able to retire the note early via a soft call feature given the tremendous share price performance we've delivered since then. This was a purely opportunistic move that cleans up our balance sheet at a time when many other players in our space have convert maturities over the next few years that are massive relative to their market caps. We are now effectively debt free as the UBS line of credit is secured by our own cash and earnings is roughly the same as the cost of the capital. We closed this transaction in October, so the convert will be wiped off the books when we print the 10-K this year. Okay. Good. Let's get to the guide on the next page. As Steve covered, we now expect revenues between $1.61 billion and $1.64 billion, which is up roughly $300 million compared to our initial guide this year and implies continued growth in Q4. We've had very strong volume growth this year, but the revenue growth has really accelerated this year as we've seen strong realized pricing performance in all of the major products. Signatera especially has seen its ASP mature this year. moving from the 800s in the past to now roughly $1,050 as of Q3. Note that $1,050 number is before the true-ups. That's the kind of organic repeatable number that we anchor on internally. These same drivers are also transforming gross margins, and we now expect full year gross margins in the range of 58% to 61%. We are bumping OpEx to account for elevated litigation and stock-based comp expenses for the year in addition to the fact that we continue to keep our foot on the gas for future growth. Finally, I'm very pleased to update the guide to cash generation of $50 million to $75 million this year where we started the year expecting to burn about $50 million. So a meaningful swing there. As you think about how this continues into 2025, do keep in mind that there's about $108 million in true-ups baked into Q1 through Q3 revenue actuals now that we would not include in our guide for next year, so the organic underlying range for this year's revenue translates to $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion and gross margins of 56% to 58%. Those results are still well above our initial expectations and form a solid baseline for growth into next year. As in the past, baseline 2025 goal should be to grow the same number of units next year as we have in 2024. From there, I think we'll need to take into consideration the fact that we got a bolus of women's health units from Invitae in Q2, and that same influx of new units won't repeat next year. And then on the plus side, of course, our base Signatera users continue to grow, and we expect to continue to receive recurrence monitoring orders as we continue with those patients on their cancer journey. We would typically presume some erosion in women's health ASP pricing. But given the progress we've made this year, I think it's plausible to hold ASPs steady into 2025. We are cautiously optimistic that Signatera ASPs still have room for modest improvement as we continue to see better coverage from Medicare advantage plans and possibly in the second half of the year, we could start to see some additional contributions from commercial volumes where state biomarker laws are in place. On OpEx and cash generation, Steve clearly laid out that our priority is to do everything we need to do to serve Signature patients. More commercial operations, more clinical trials and enhancing our menu of offerings. We recognize it's important to remain cash flow positive. But within the best use of that cash for the immediate term is to turn around and reinvest it in the business, particularly in support of Signatera growth. Okay. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: Really strong congrats -- I mean, a strong quarter here, congrats on this. It's great to see the cash generation. Maybe, Mike, first for you or Steve, can you outline the ASP pickup that you're seeing across the product? I know you highlighted Signatera. Can you elaborate how that Signatera ASP can continue to grow? And the stability of ASP across the other products, because I think that has come in scrutiny a bit with some of the commercial payers paying closer attention to coverage and ASPs. So wondering if you can elaborate a bit on that? Then I have questions on oncology.\nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMike Brophy: Yes, sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. So on Signatera ASPs, it's really the same kind of talk track that we've discussed previously. I mean you got really rapid movement upward in the Signatera ASPs from the 800s to now, we're at about $1,050 on an organic basis. The path from here, I think there's always puts and takes, and there's always potential for kind of quarter-to-quarter volatility with ASPs. But from here, we feel like there's more room to run in terms of just execution with Medicare advantage payers continue to increase person allowed for covered services with Medicare advantage payers. And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's going to be a grind, but I think we're cautiously optimistic, maybe second half of next year, you could start to see some additional tailwind in the Signatera ASP as these state biomarker laws have had a chance to kind of go into effect and mature and we've had a chance to interact with payers in terms of getting them online with covering those coverage services as well. So it looks like a good 18 months or so trajectory for Signatera ASPs. On the rest of the product portfolio, we've actually seen really strong kind of improvement, particularly in the major women's health products, both Horizon in Panorama. And I hear you. I mean I think there's always having just been in the diagnostics business for long enough, you're always kind of thinking about, well, is there some chance for erosion in these more mature products? And usually, I'd say, yes. I think just the actuals that we're seeing and just the -- maybe the time on task and the fact that these offerings are more and more enshrined as just kind of without kind of in the standard of care for prenatal health has kind of given us more confidence and a bit more visibility on our ASPs there. So let me pause there, Steve, I don't know if you have anything else to add.\nSteve Chapman: No, that's good. I mean I'll just add, over the last couple of years, we've invested a lot into improving things like medical appeals, getting the medical records when requested. And I think you're seeing some of the benefit of just executing on those things. And then of course, there's still upside opportunity when we look at some of the tests that we're performing today where we're not really getting paid, for example, like 22q or RH testing in the women's health sector or expanding to additional indications in oncology. So I think it's positive upside opportunity ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That's great. And then on the Signatera, can you elaborate how much of the lift are you seeing from volume growth in the community setting or maybe the tier 2 setting vs when you present data at these conferences, including ESMO, ASCO and others, the lift you get from that is, I assume, is mostly in the community -- in the academic setting, but just trying to parse out where you're seeing the growth and the sustainability of this growth, obviously very strong in the quarter.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, good question. So it's really a mix. I mean we see uplift here in both academic and in the community setting. As we've said, we think about 40% of oncologists are using Signatera today. And so there's still a long way to go. The market is very underpenetrated in sort of the kind of low single-digit penetration. Every time we generate data, I think that just helps bring more and more physicians into the fray. And especially when you're talking about the type of data that we generated with GALAXY, that's exactly what people want to see is this longer-term overall survival data that now kind of we're getting to that level of follow-up where you're hitting that mark where you're kind of meeting the threshold that some of the doctors that have been holding out have been waiting for. And then, of course, we're really excited about data that we're going to have upcoming in the future randomized readouts. So I think there's a long way to go, but we're seeing it from both academic and community.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And last one, just Alex, maybe, Alex, the Nature Medicine paper, where is that most helpful? Is that most helpful for NCCN or is it driving deeper into the clinical practices? And maybe just elaborate what you expect out of the 702 study at ESMO? And then would that study actually give you any further insights into the IMvigor011 study?\nAlexey Aleshin: Sure. Thanks for the question, Puneet. I would say for the Nature Medicine study, it's helpful, I would say, pretty much across the board. I would say, first of all, a lot of doctors have been waiting for OS data. I think DFS is one thing, but actually seeing the assays predicted of patients living longer, I think the whole field has been kind of waiting for a well-powered study to read that out. I think the second part for that study is the pharmaceutical market. I think we've really been able to show that DFS dynamics is predictive of overall survival. And that's really the first step to kind of validate a new certain end point. So I think we're seeing a lot of interest in those results. And I think that makes us very confident, right, about some additional readouts that we've been awaiting. I think the 702 study, I think, will kind of defer commenting on the outcome of that until the embargo is listed for ASCO GI. But again, it's over 1,000 patients. It was a well design perspective randomized study. So we're excited to share those results when we're able to. And then for IMvigor011, I think that's on track. We'd expect our partner Genentech to probably read out those results in probably the first half of 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDaniel Brennan: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe first one just on Signatera price, Mike, the $1,050 nice improvement but a little bit more modest than what we've seen in prior quarters. Can you just speak to -- I know you gave some color in the prepared remarks, just speak to kind of some of the drivers of price from here in particular, like on the biomarker, I know you guys have been -- I felt fairly constructive on what this opportunity could be. You've had, I think, five states live for over a year. You had three of the biggest states in the country go live in the last month or so. So I'm just wondering what your experience has been and whether or not that could be more of an upside driver and maybe you're kind of making some good services in there?\nMike Brophy: Yes. No, thanks for the question. No, it's been really constructive so far. I mean the interactions we've had from payers has been quite positive, actually. It's just our experience has been any time you have coverage like this that comes online. It just takes about a year between the time that the coverage comes online to you get some denials back in the door, you appeal those denials, then you kind of get a critical mass of thousands of cases where you've submitted the claim correctly and appeals have been denied. And then you got to interact with natural human, more senior person at that payer and just work with them on the workflow. And it's been really collaborative so far. So as I said for that, I feel really optimistic about it. But the timeline I gave that's just reflective of the way things work and how long it takes just to get the logistics right. Hopefully, you can come faster but we'll have to see. In terms of like the pace of the increase, I mean, I think that's an important point. I mean there's kind of no way for us to just increase the Signatera ASP $200 a year forever. I mean, there's a maturity that we tried to get to here as we've kind of gotten into the launch. So that's just a realistic consideration. Having said that, I mean, the gross margins in the products are quite strong. I think they can continue to get stronger. So that, coupled with the data that Alex highlighted on the call today, we're feeling really strong about the Signatera franchise.\nDaniel Brennan: Got it. And maybe just one follow-up. Maybe I'll say on the financial side, just on the gross margins, really nice gross margin expansion 400 basis points ex the true-ups. I know you talked about -- Steve talked about in the prepared remarks, some of the only cost initiatives. Can you just give some more color on the driver there? Are we starting to see the benefit of the adjuvant surveillance mix shift starting to come through, which is a nice gross margin leverage and I know you kind of updated the full year guide, but as we -- I think you talked a little bit about '25, Mike, in the prepared remarks, but how do we think about the trajectory of gross margins as we kind of turn the calendar into '25?\nMike Brophy: Yes. I mean I think on the mix shift, that has remained relatively steady. I mean we've seen some move in favor of the recurrence monitoring within the mix. I think what's more important if you're thinking about mix for our corporate gross margins, is the mix between kind of franchises. So for a long time, Panorama was far and away, our biggest product. And now -- first last quarter, but now really this quarter is really the first quarter where Signatera revenues are meaningfully higher than Panorama and it's now our biggest revenue product. So given the margins that we're seeing on Signatera now accreted the corporate gross margins, that itself is kind of driving this kind of corporate gross margin improvement. So I think that trend can continue to move in our favor as far as corporate gross margins go for next year. Having said that, I mean, I think it's worth just understanding kind of the prior -- the Steve's first question, which is like what's the kind of rate of increase in ASPs and they have to -- they have to moderate, right? I mean they have to be kind of more kind of steady improvements, and I would expect that to be reflected in the corporate gross margin trajectory as you go into next year as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Just a couple of cleanups to start on, perhaps the guidance framework or even just what you're seeing in terms of recent trends in the business, Steve. So First of all, in light of some of the pain the private payers are going through in the Medicare book of business, have you seen any uptick in prior auth or just more documentation required in the last few months across the oncology portfolio I know you mentioned the biomarker middle rollout starting to help a little bit in the back half of next year. But is there any risk here that some of these private payers might grab their feet on the implementation at all? And then, Mike, just to clean up on the guide really, can you quantify the weather impacts and to what extent that was a little bit of an offsetting factor in the revised guide?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I think a good question on the insurance payers. I mean the good news for us is we've sort of been dealing with all sorts of obstacles for years with respect to payers, whether that's prior authorization, medical records requests just sort of outright denials and then having to appeal and this is something that, like we've developed systems, protocols and processes in order to make sure that we can follow through and just not get kind of bogged down by these various bureaucratic procedures. So we've invested heavily there. Over the last couple of years, we've had tons of improvements. And I don't think we've noticed anything really different recently than what we've seen historically. But what we are seeing is that Natera is getting better just responding to those types of things. And so I think that was definitely a good investment with regards to the biomarker bills and commercial opportunities, as Mike said, these things take time. And it's good that we have that ahead of us. We've done really well historically and that we still have this upside opportunity from biomarker bill implementation and commercial payer coverage in Signatera. The other area that Mike didn't highlight earlier, there could be upside opportunity is just getting Medicare coverage in some additional indications. And there's lots of areas where we published that we were in the process of submitting or interacting with Medicare to get additional coverages for Signatera. So we think that's an opportunity. And then, of course, when you look back at both in organ health and then women's health, there's opportunities for ASP improvement, particularly around getting coverage for indications where -- or test today where we currently don't have coverage.\nMike Brophy: And then, Tejas on the weather -- just on the weather question. We think it's always hard to measure these things with precision. We think we saw a really modest impact to the weather with the hurricanes hitting like that last week in Q3. So that probably had a modest impact on the Q3 results. And I think there was an impact that we saw in October and it remains to be seen what that impact would be for the full quarter. But that -- we've kind of taken that into account. We try to take a kind of a cautious approach to the guide to try and work around that as people kind of not only just weather itself, as people kind of get their homes rebuild and kind of get themselves back into seeing their positions and such?\nTejas Savant: Got it. Okay. And then one on Signatera and the 702 study guys. How should we be thinking about framing those DFS and OS results in terms of what's clinically meaningful for physicians. And also, given that the results will be dependent on the drug evaluated, obviously, can you provide a little bit of color or context around prior studies that showed CELEBREX on top of standard adjuvant chemo and is a promising approach in certain populations?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Alex, do you want to take that?\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes, absolutely. Well, I think there's two parts to the question. The first is how well is the drug tolerated, the class of drugs tolerated. And then kind of what could be clinically meaningful in terms of an outcome from the study. I think the good news is that unlike traditional adjuvant chemotherapy, which has significant toxicities, sometimes a risk of death. I think the NSAID class of drugs, of which CELEBREX is one of them, are pretty well tolerated. It's obviously not without side effects completely, but relatively, this is a class of drugs, thousands and millions of folks are taken for other indications. I think what good looks like, I think, obviously, that's going to depend on a few things. How does the readout look in terms of DFS, in terms of OS, and how does it compare to prior studies. I think we've said in the past kind of the last study that led to an approval with a new agent was the MOSAIC study, and had a hazard ratio and kind of 0.75%, 0.77% range for DFS and a very small benefit for OS. So we do think that's kind of a good number to think about. I think CELEBREX itself in the initial 702 study without any selection, I think showed a hazard ratio of, I think, around kind of 0.8%, 0.9% range, depending if it was for DFS or OS, and it was obviously not statistically significant. So maybe kind of long answer, but I think the short of it is, we do think anything that's significant below 0.8% hazard ratio for DFS and/or OS and be significant, especially with the class of drugs that's pretty well tolerated.\nTejas Savant: Okay. That's actually really helpful. And Steve, last one for me on screening. We've been getting the question a little bit. Back in September, you talked about being relatively close to sharing that data. And I think you'd also called out that you expect initial proof of concept to be a little bit more sophisticated and fulsome than your initial expectations, which was going to help you sort of inform that go/no-go decision. So just curious as to where we are in terms of that process? Is year-end still the right benchmark on time lines there? And have the post evolved a little bit in your mind in light of the ESMO data on advanced adenoma from one of your peers?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, it's a good question. So yes, we plan on actually reading that out as we said, I would say, very early in 2025, there's a couple of big investor conferences and medical conferences where we're going to be reading out the initial early cancer detection screening data in CRC and just stay tuned. We're very close now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So first I have just on Signatera volume. Can you walk us through what you guys are assuming within 4Q for quarter-over-quarter Signatera volume growth? You've historically talked about this 8,000 to 10,000 rate for the past few quarters. You've obviously been beating that as well. So should we expect that trend of beating that volume level into 4Q to continue? And then what kind of a sequential assumption when we head into 2025?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I think as we -- well, first on Q3, I mean, obviously, this was like a really strong quarter. I think we did 11,400 sequentially. That was, I think, the third fastest we've ever had well above this average of 8,000 to 10,000. We said all along that you just really can't kind of get into the kind of quarter-over-quarter sequential comparisons just because there's differences in sort of the number of holidays, the differences in the number of receiving days, and you can just -- I mean 1 day could be 2,000 additional samples, right, that you weren't able to access because maybe it was a Sunday or maybe it was a holiday or something like that. So we're just sort of sticking with that conservative estimate of saying, look, 8,000 to 10,000 is sort of the average, that's kind of roughly what we've plugged in. But of course, we're always trying to beat that and either for outperformance or for just kind of the way the days fell and so forth. We've been able to come above that in the last several quarters.\nMike Brophy: I think on the Q4 number in particular, we don't really have enough Q4s in our in our bag to tell you exactly like what the seasonality is with this product just yet? And to Steve's point, I mean, like obviously, in Q4, you're going have more holidays. Last Q4, we ended up having a strong number, but like Christmas and New Year's landed on opposing weekends that made it very -- we take that whole week off. So we ended up, I think, in retrospect, got a lot of units kind of the first two weeks in January that would have normally landed in December. So hence, the caution around trying to land a specific number for a quarter here. But taking a little bit more caution around Q4 just because there are a lot of holidays.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. But I think also as we said in the prepared remarks, I mean we -- despite, I think, this hurricane hit in the beginning of October, we were off to a fast start Q4.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Got it. And then by just on SG&A. You raised the guide for SG&A for the year. And you've talked about accelerating some of your growth investments. So obviously, it makes sense to invest into the business. But just can you break down for us where is that driving increased spend going towards? And then on 2025, you've historically talked about this like annual OpEx growth of mid-single digits to high single digits over time. So is that the right way for us to think about 2025? Or what other factors should we be considering that would move the number higher or lower relative to that range?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Let me comment on just kind of where we're investing. And then maybe, Mike, you can comment on sort of what it looks like in '25. Look, we've -- there's obviously a lot areas of investment and expanding clinical trials, investing heavily into innovation, user experience, customer service, new patient portals, EMR connectivity, expanding, I think, certain areas of marketing, certain areas where it makes sense to add a handful of salespeople here or there, maybe more significant expansions. So we're doing all those things. And like we said, we're in the very early stages of this opportunity. And we plan on investing in order to be able to serve as many patients as possible with our tests, and we're making those investments. Mike, do you want to talk about '25?\nMike Brophy: No, I think that's still the right kind of framework going to '25. We mentioned in the prepared remarks. I mean we're going to -- we don't really have an appetite to come back to you guys and say, we're going to burn some good amount of cash next year, and we understand that we need to be on the plus side of the ledger in terms of cash. But beyond that, our focus are -- really our primary focus really does remain on serving our patients and continuing to grow the opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. First, on volume growth. You're tracking the year-on-year volume growth of, I think, about $550,000, maybe $600,000. Mike, if I heard you right, I think you said at some point on the call, we should expect similar volume growth next year. Did I get that right? And if so, does that mean a similar number of incremental tests across the portfolio next year?\nMike Brophy: Yes. I mean, I think that's always kind of our baseline to try and do that as a growth goal, is to focus on this, quantify this as absolute units rather than growth rates. I think the growth rates become challenging because the base business becomes so much bigger. So that's going to be the goal. Similar comments as what Steve gave previously though, as it relates to the different drivers and the puts and takes.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. Year-to-date, you have about $110 million in true-ups. Hopefully, I did that math right. Obviously, we don't know what Q4 true-ups are going to be. That said, as we model out of next year, should we be kind of taken true-ups out of the base as we think about normalizing the business space? Or is there an argument that these true-ups are actually indicative of better collections and sustainable ASP improvements?\nMike Brophy: Well, I think it's both. I mean the reality is that the collections have come in ahead of our expectations as defined by our accruals from last year. And so that's what's kind of driving true-ups, which should happen when the ASPs are going up this much. But the ASP is going up a lot is an attempt to kind of respond to that and just kind of match the revenue as best we can based on the information we have available to us at the time when we put to queue. So it's our kind of expectation that we're going to continue to see true-ups moderate. And as we kind of go into next year with the guide, I still think it's appropriate to guide about the true ups because it's just impossible to kind of model the timing of when you get cash for a bunch of units that you're on the second appeal for and that you finally get the cash in, that's no way to guide kind of an operational business.\nDouglas Schenkel: Yes. And Mike, I'm with you. And again, for whatever my opinion is worth like everything you just said makes sense. What I'm getting at is you've had these consistent true-ups, presumably from periods that aren't years ago, they're presumably closer and closer to the quarter we're in. So it's almost as if like these true-ups are actually indicative of, obviously, their collections from past periods, but you're actually getting paid more frequently on these tests. So I wouldn't expect you to model -- our guide true-ups into the model. But I could see this being a sign that like, yes, the ASPs are actually going higher, and this is sustainable. Is that logical?\nMike Brophy: Yes, definitely. I mean, I think that the fact that for those of you who've followed the -- follows for a long time know that we typically have some pretty comes commentary about which way ASPs are going when we guide, we guide to some erosion. And that's what we're seeing, I think, gives us some confidence that we can -- women's health that we can we can be in the zone where we are now. And then there are some specific drivers to the Signatera ASP that we think are ahead of us, right? So Medicare advantage and potentially state biomarker bills. So I do think your -- the improvement in the kind of the collections and the reduction of the DSOs, I mean, I think that where that gets reflected is, one, in the ASPs actually are getting higher in terms of like what we're reporting every quarter. And also that's getting reflected in our confidence in terms of what we can do over the longer term. With the remaining that you will have ups and downs with ASPs and Diagnostics business, it's just the way it goes, but we feel that we're in a good spot there.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. Last one, Mike, what was the mix of first-time tests versus recurrence monitoring. I think Dan may have tried to get at that earlier, but I'm just curious if you could give us anything specific there because it was a really good gross margin quarter. Obviously, as that mix shift starts to kind of kick in, that's another leg to gross margin, but I didn't hear anything on the call to suggest that, that was like a material driver in this period to the margin improvement.\nMike Brophy: Yes. And just one tweak there rather than like first-time patients, I think there's a -- what we typically talk about is a split between patients that are in their adjuvant treatment window, like volume in the adjuvant treatment window, we're going to reimburse on the bundle, for example, and then patients who are getting a recurrent monitoring tests. That trend has continue to be pretty balanced between the 2. And what's happening there is that you have very healthy retention of patients that have stayed with us and continue to get Signatera through their journey as they go into remission. And then we continue to fill this top of the funnel. We continue to get new patients in the door. And so that has continued to increase our patients here in the adjuvant treatment window. And the net of all that is that we've been pretty balanced between adjuvant window, petitions and recurrence monitoring so far. So that by itself is not kind of -- there's not some huge move in that trend just in this quarter. The bigger move though is kind of just the mix of the different franchises in terms of contribution to total revenue and the implications that has for ported gross margins, as I described to Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Sykes: Congrats on the quarter. Mike, maybe just the first one for you. Just following up on Rachel's question on the OpEx. I'm just curious, as you think about the women's health business, certainly as it relates to sales and marketing. Are we at kind of a steady state there on the sales and marketing side, where there's sort of some maintenance investment you think you made, but most of the sales and marketing is going towards Signatera. I'm just trying to think about as we move into '25, how you're thinking about the allocation of OpEx across the product portfolio? And just want to make sure that my assumption on the Signatera is the sort of the beneficiary spend are going to be maintained into next year?\nMike Brophy: Steve, do you have a take on that? Or do you want me to go?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I'll comment and then you have extra. But yes, I would say that's about right. I mean, look, there's we already have, I think, a pretty big presence from a commercial standpoint in women's health, and we built that over the last 12 years or so. Obviously, we're sometimes able to kind of add an additional medical science liaisons or genetic counselors, medical directors, maybe do some new clinical trials and do innovative things like we did with the [ residual disease ] test that we -- was a very time of launch and able to help a lot of patients. But largely, yes, we're focusing on I think, helping oncology patients, and we see that Signatera is really making an impact on care, and we're seeing that it's at the very early stages, and that's where a lot of the spending is going, both when you look at additional clinical trials, you look at research and development, you look at innovation, you look at sort of we already do have a big commercial presence there, but you look at sort of rounding that out, that's where a lot of the spending is going.\nMatthew Sykes: Got it. And then just for my follow-up, just on Signatera. Have there been any noticeable differences in indication growth. Meaning, I know it CRC and breast is sort of the main ones, but have you seen any shift towards different indications that any that are ramping up significantly that might have been sort of lower volumes to begin with? Or has it been pretty consistent this whole time?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I think it's been pretty consistent, but certainly, what drives utilization broadly is peer-reviewed evidence. And where we're able to generate data, which we've done a lot of. I think we now have more than 85 publications supporting the use of the Signatera technology where we're able to generate data, that tends to be kind of where you see physicians using the product. And that makes sense, right? You want to have the evidence-based decision-making. So some of the areas that we talked about, muscle invasive bladder, we're excited about that with IMvigor010 being, I think, a very strong study itself and now with the IMvigor011 data reading out in 2025, as Alex mentioned, I think that's a great opportunity. Of course, IO monitoring is another area where we do see quite a bit of utilization we generated some good data there. So yes, it's a mix. It's one of the reasons why I think there's still some upside opportunity from getting coverage even from Medicare on additional indications is that we do have a decent chunk of utilization that's outside of the currently covered indications.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies.\nTycho Peterson: A lot has been asked already. Just a couple on the numbers here in the near term. What was the Invitae contribution in the quarter? And then you did raise by more than the beat, $40 million by more than the beat, what's the delta on that?\nMike Brophy: Yes. The delta is really just the -- just continued growth kind of across the book is what we've seen. I would also encourage you to back up the true-ups as well. But nonetheless, even back at the true-up. So we increased the guidance more than -- substantially more than the beat, and that's just kind of all the comments we've made on the call so far in terms of kind of where the business is. Invitae contribution, you haven't broken up specifically other than to say, like I think the beginning of the year, we added a $25 million contributor to the guide, and we kind of move that to $40 million, and it's been in that zone in terms of full year contribution, and that's where we have it for the guide for the year.\nTycho Peterson: And then I guess thinking about the framework you've put in place for next year, the 500,000 to 600,000 tests, where do you think kind of the community penetration goes? And then it sounds like you don't feel like you need to add additional reps at this point as we think about next year?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I'll just comment on penetration. I mean, look, obviously, it's slightly different by tumor type and then whether you're talking about sort of the adjuvant setting or new incident patients or the prevalent pool of patients. But looking broadly at the bigger opportunity, I mean, we still think we're in the low single digits. So there's a ton of opportunity ahead in community and academic settings. And we are adding sales team members in additional to medical team members and doing more clinical trials, which is a big part of our investment.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then just lastly, I guess, on time lines for the readouts on breast and kidney, should we still expect those next year as well? I mean, I know we've covered CRC and bladder and some of the other indications, but how do we think about the breast and kidney time lines?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. We've got, I think, a very solid road map of data that's going to be reading out. So not just across those indications, but I think a broad sort of span of indications. We've got pretty big data sets reading out, which we're excited about. So I think right now, there's probably over 100 trials that are underway that are going to be reading out the various time points. So we're excited about that. We're excited about generating evidence that can drive additional coverage from Medicare and that can drive additional utilization.\nOperator: This will conclude our Q&A session.

            "content": "Thanks Steve. I'm pleased to share some of the recent results from the GALAXY study in colorectal cancer, which we believe were universally excellent across the board, particularly on Signatera's ability to predict overall survival as well as adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in patients with CRC. As many of you know, GALAXY is part of the Circulate Platform study. We have presented a few datasets thus far which have focused on disease free survival since overall survival takes longer to mature. At the ESMO conference in September and published concurrently in Nature Medicine, we show for the first time an overall survival signal associated with Signatera in a prospective study. Given that overall survival is such an important metric for oncologists and the gold standard for clinical trials, we view this as a major milestone for the field. There are a few main points I want to highlight for you today. The first is that Signatera was predictive of overall survival. Patients who tested Signatera positive had a much worse prognosis than Signatera negative patients, around 10 times worse at 36 months. Furthermore, Signatera was the most significant predictor of recurrence as well as overall survival when compared to all known clinical pathological risk factors. The second point is that Signatera predicted an overall survival benefit from chemotherapy. The GALAXY results show that if a patient tested Signatera positive and received chemotherapy, they had a superior overall survival with a 50% lower risk of death versus patients who did not receive treatment. The study also demonstrated that patients who tested negative had no significant benefit from chemo in terms of OS, highlighting the potential for de-escalation of adjuvant therapy for a large portion of patients. And finally, we looked at Signatera clearance after adjuvant therapy. We showed that patients who cleared ctDNA and remained Signatera negative had superior outcomes with 24-month overall survival being 100%. In comparison, patients who did not achieve CTA clearance at 24 months had an OS of just 61%. These findings may allow for personalization of treatment and recurrence monitoring that we hope can fundamentally change how colorectal cancer is managed. So, in summary, we believe these results are incredibly significant and further expand the body of evidence supporting Signatera in CRC. Moving to the next slide, I'm also happy to provide an update on a key study in colorectal cancer. As per our press release earlier this morning, I'll first summarize the main points and why we believe this is such an important trial. To start, the study is drawn from the CALGB/SWOG 80702 study that we'll refer going forward as the 702 study, a randomized Phase III clinical trial in CRC, which evaluated the benefit of adding celecoxib to adjuvant chemotherapy in the postoperative management of patients with stage III colorectal cancer. Individuals in the study were randomized to either receive adjuvant chemotherapy plus placebo or adjuvant chemotherapy plus celecoxib. The original study results published in 2021 showed that the addition of celecoxib did not significantly improve disease free survival in patients with stage III colon cancer. However, that study was initially run without Signatera. The new analyses used samples from the 702 study to investigate whether Signatera can be utilized to identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from escalation of adjuvant therapy with the addition of celecoxib. This pre specified analysis included more than 1,000 patients with Signatera CTA status post-surgery, so it will be a sizable readout. We will report on Signatera's ability to predict DFS and OS benefit from the addition of celecoxib. The results have been accepted as a late breaking abstract for ASCO GI along with the results of the Altair study, but we look forward to sharing more details on both in late January. On this next slide we provide a bit more context on Celecoxib, also known as Celebrex which as I mentioned is a drug being investigated in this trial. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID, and as many of you are likely aware, NSAIDs are class of drugs like aspirin that can be used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation and bring down fevers. These medicines are widely available, relatively non-toxic and generally low cost. NSAIDs have also shown promise in benefiting certain subpopulations in CRC. For example, several studies suggest that NSAIDs reduce the risk of developing precancerous colon polyps. There's a clear need for additional adjuvant treatment options for patients with colorectal cancer as there has not been a new drug approval in this space for over 20 years. Our analysis will be the first randomized study to help address this unmet need and we are hopeful that Signatera can help open the door to effective treatment options in colorectal cancer personalized to patients who are most likely to benefit. And with that I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike? Sure. Thanks for the question, Puneet. I would say for the Nature Medicine study, it's helpful, I would say, pretty much across the board. I would say, first of all, a lot of doctors have been waiting for OS data. I think DFS is one thing, but actually seeing the assays predicted of patients living longer, I think the whole field has been kind of waiting for a well-powered study to read that out. I think the second part for that study is the pharmaceutical market. I think we've really been able to show that DFS dynamics is predictive of overall survival. And that's really the first step to kind of validate a new certain end point. So I think we're seeing a lot of interest in those results. And I think that makes us very confident, right, about some additional readouts that we've been awaiting. I think the 702 study, I think, will kind of defer commenting on the outcome of that until the embargo is listed for ASCO GI. But again, it's over 1,000 patients. It was a well design perspective randomized study. So we're excited to share those results when we're able to. And then for IMvigor011, I think that's on track. We'd expect our partner Genentech to probably read out those results in probably the first half of 2025. Yes, absolutely. Well, I think there's two parts to the question. The first is how well is the drug tolerated, the class of drugs tolerated. And then kind of what could be clinically meaningful in terms of an outcome from the study. I think the good news is that unlike traditional adjuvant chemotherapy, which has significant toxicities, sometimes a risk of death. I think the NSAID class of drugs, of which CELEBREX is one of them, are pretty well tolerated. It's obviously not without side effects completely, but relatively, this is a class of drugs, thousands and millions of folks are taken for other indications. I think what good looks like, I think, obviously, that's going to depend on a few things. How does the readout look in terms of DFS, in terms of OS, and how does it compare to prior studies. I think we've said in the past kind of the last study that led to an approval with a new agent was the MOSAIC study, and had a hazard ratio and kind of 0.75%, 0.77% range for DFS and a very small benefit for OS. So we do think that's kind of a good number to think about. I think CELEBREX itself in the initial 702 study without any selection, I think showed a hazard ratio of, I think, around kind of 0.8%, 0.9% range, depending if it was for DFS or OS, and it was obviously not statistically significant. So maybe kind of long answer, but I think the short of it is, we do think anything that's significant below 0.8% hazard ratio for DFS and/or OS and be significant, especially with the class of drugs that's pretty well tolerated."

            "content": "Thanks Mike. Let's get into the highlights on the next slide. 2024 has already been a transformational year for Natera and I think Q3 represents our best quarter yet. We generated $439.8 million in revenue, up 64% from the third quarter of last year, which represents a record quarter for revenue growth. Volumes continue to grow rapidly, up 24% year-over-year. We performed about 137,000 oncology tests in the quarter, which is up 54% from last year. Signatera Clinical Units posted another strong quarter, up 11.4 thousand units sequentially versus Q2. This is the third fastest quarter over quarter growth we've had since launch. We also grew record 48.4 thousand units year-on-year, which is the best quarter we've ever had in terms of growth units. Our gross margins were 62% in the quarter, again a record for us. And after breaking even on cash for a couple of quarters in a row, we generated $34.5 million in cash this quarter, which is of course another important milestone in our evolution. All of this puts us in a position to raise our guidance for the year. With revenue expectations now at $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, that implies about 50% revenue growth for the full year, which would be the fastest full year growth we've had as a public company and is significantly above our own internal expectations from the beginning of the year. Many of you saw the groundbreaking GALAXY data published in Nature Medicine and concurrently presented at ESMO in September, which delivered outstanding prospective overall survival data in MRD for the first time. We think this data is important because it strongly supports the core indication for MRD testing, adjuvant decision making and recurrence monitoring. In colorectal cancer physicians have moved beyond analytical metrics and clinical validation studies and now expect to see prospective outcomes data like this. As a reminder, this took us over four years to generate and we have a median of 24 months clinical follow up, with a good portion of patients having three years of follow up. I'm also pleased to announce the completion of a study using Signatera from the CALGB/SWOG 80702 trial, which is a randomized phase three study in CRC. These results have been accepted as a late breaking abstract for the ASCO GI Conference in January. As you saw from our press release, we see this trial as one of the most important in the space given its size, randomized design and indication. As a reminder, the trial is looking at whether Signatera can predict which patients will benefit from escalation of adjuvant therapy and will report on disease free survival and overall survival respectively. Similar to Altair, this will be another trial that is drug dependent and we look forward to sharing results in early 2025. We also expect results from the GSK ZEST trial in breast cancer will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Symposium next month. As a reminder, this trial was terminated in April of 2023 due to low trial enrollment, so it's underpowered. But we're still looking to see a trend towards improved disease free survival in MRD positive patients treated with niraparib versus placebo. Okay, let's get on to some of the business trends. The first slide shows Q3 volumes over time and despite the scale of the business, our growth continues to be very strong. In women's health over the past year, we saw significant growth from our direct channel augmented by the Invitae volume we added earlier this year. In addition, we launched our Fetal RhD test at a time of critical need in the prenatal community. We are really seeing strong demand for this test which can help physicians assess the need for medication traditionally given to RhD negative women to prevent potential complications in future pregnancies. As we've spoken about previously, having an RhD test and the timeliness of our launch was important given that OB-GYNs were facing limited supplies of this medication. The launch is also a great example of the passion and commitment of the Natera team rallying to help patients in need. We're excited about the future of the women's health business and we are working hard to help as many patients as possible get access to our differentiated suite of testing. We also had another excellent quarter in Oregon Health with strong volume growth year-on-year. The strength of our peer reviewed evidence and differentiated product pipeline is being received very well by physicians. We now have more than 45 peer reviewed papers in Oregon Health, including the largest prospective study published in the field to date. We look forward to continuing to serve physicians and patients as we move forward. On the next slide, we're double clicking on the Signatera clinical volumes. We processed 137,000 units in Q3, which includes 130,000 Signatera clinical volumes. This represents growth of about 11,400 units in the quarter, well above our average of between eight and 10,000 units. The volume was one of our best quarters of growth ever. Given sequential quarters tend to have some variability in terms of holidays and number of receiving days. It's also useful to look at the trend year-on-year. Q3 clinical units were 48.4 thousand higher this year compared to Q3 of last year, a record for the company. We're off to a great start in Q4 despite the impact of the hurricane and the trends are continuing to be very positive. Okay, the next slide shows total revenues year-on-year and a sequential quarter trend. We are very pleased to post 64% revenue growth year-on-year. We have $34.5 million in revenue true ups, which is lower than last quarter as expected, and Mike will talk more about that later in the call. Even stripping out those trips would have yielded a growth rate of 50%, which compares very favorably with our fastest growing quarters despite the fact that the revenue base has gotten much larger in the past few years. While the volumes are clearly providing a strong base for growth, ASP improvement continues to contribute to our revenue growth. We've seen progress across the board as we've worked hard to improve reimbursement for covered services in women's health and the Signatera ASP continues to improve. It's important to recall that we reached this level without getting any tailwinds for the Women's health guidelines. While we remain optimistic on guidelines for both carrier screening and 22Q, we plan to be successful with or without guidelines, and we're pleased to see that happening. Our growth in total company ASPs is also a function of our product mix evolving towards Signatera. That shift in product mix is fueling the evolution of our gross margins as shown here on the next slide. 62% gross margin is a record for us and well above our expectations at the beginning of the year. ASPs were once again very strong across all of our major products and we're pleased to see Signatera ASP step up modestly once again in the quarter compared to Q2. The COGS wins from the first half held steady in Q3 and we delivered a significant gross margin expansion over Q2. The true ups moderated slightly, down to just under $35 million this quarter. This represents excellent execution as the cash receipts exceeded our past expectations. Excluding true ups, underlying gross margins expanded considerably from roughly 55% gross margins in Q2 to over 58% gross margins in Q3. Again, that is driven by strong ASPs execution on COGS projects and the continuing mix shift in the business towards Signatera. While reimbursement can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we feel like we are very well positioned to continue to drive margins higher led by Signatera volumes and ASPs continuing to ramp. So accelerating revenues and gross margins coupled with cash collections well in excess of prior expectations are leading us to our first quarter of meaningful cash flow generation. The chart demonstrates quite a journey from Q1 of 2022 where we burned $162 million in a single quarter. The reality is that our strategy has remained the same throughout this timeframe depicted on the chart. We made the big investments required to deliver excellent care for patients and the volumes and reimbursement followed. While we've been very efficient with resources, we've gotten here without big cost cuts that jeopardize the future of our business. In fact, as Mike will cover in the guide, we've continued to invest in future growth by adding meaningful investments to our R&D and commercial teams. As we look into 2025, we will continue to prioritize innovation and customer service while managing to cash flow break even. We think that's the best approach for patients, for doctors and for the business given the size of the markets that we're in. With that, let me hand it over to Alex to provide an update on Oncology. Alex? Mike, do you want to take that? No, that's good. I mean I'll just add, over the last couple of years, we've invested a lot into improving things like medical appeals, getting the medical records when requested. And I think you're seeing some of the benefit of just executing on those things. And then of course, there's still upside opportunity when we look at some of the tests that we're performing today where we're not really getting paid, for example, like 22q or RH testing in the women's health sector or expanding to additional indications in oncology. So I think it's positive upside opportunity ahead. Yes, good question. So it's really a mix. I mean we see uplift here in both academic and in the community setting. As we've said, we think about 40% of oncologists are using Signatera today. And so there's still a long way to go. The market is very underpenetrated in sort of the kind of low single-digit penetration. Every time we generate data, I think that just helps bring more and more physicians into the fray. And especially when you're talking about the type of data that we generated with GALAXY, that's exactly what people want to see is this longer-term overall survival data that now kind of we're getting to that level of follow-up where you're hitting that mark where you're kind of meeting the threshold that some of the doctors that have been holding out have been waiting for. And then, of course, we're really excited about data that we're going to have upcoming in the future randomized readouts. So I think there's a long way to go, but we're seeing it from both academic and community. Yes. I think a good question on the insurance payers. I mean the good news for us is we've sort of been dealing with all sorts of obstacles for years with respect to payers, whether that's prior authorization, medical records requests just sort of outright denials and then having to appeal and this is something that, like we've developed systems, protocols and processes in order to make sure that we can follow through and just not get kind of bogged down by these various bureaucratic procedures. So we've invested heavily there. Over the last couple of years, we've had tons of improvements. And I don't think we've noticed anything really different recently than what we've seen historically. But what we are seeing is that Natera is getting better just responding to those types of things. And so I think that was definitely a good investment with regards to the biomarker bills and commercial opportunities, as Mike said, these things take time. And it's good that we have that ahead of us. We've done really well historically and that we still have this upside opportunity from biomarker bill implementation and commercial payer coverage in Signatera. The other area that Mike didn't highlight earlier, there could be upside opportunity is just getting Medicare coverage in some additional indications. And there's lots of areas where we published that we were in the process of submitting or interacting with Medicare to get additional coverages for Signatera. So we think that's an opportunity. And then, of course, when you look back at both in organ health and then women's health, there's opportunities for ASP improvement, particularly around getting coverage for indications where -- or test today where we currently don't have coverage. Yes. Alex, do you want to take that? Yes, it's a good question. So yes, we plan on actually reading that out as we said, I would say, very early in 2025, there's a couple of big investor conferences and medical conferences where we're going to be reading out the initial early cancer detection screening data in CRC and just stay tuned. We're very close now. Yes. So I think as we -- well, first on Q3, I mean, obviously, this was like a really strong quarter. I think we did 11,400 sequentially. That was, I think, the third fastest we've ever had well above this average of 8,000 to 10,000. We said all along that you just really can't kind of get into the kind of quarter-over-quarter sequential comparisons just because there's differences in sort of the number of holidays, the differences in the number of receiving days, and you can just -- I mean 1 day could be 2,000 additional samples, right, that you weren't able to access because maybe it was a Sunday or maybe it was a holiday or something like that. So we're just sort of sticking with that conservative estimate of saying, look, 8,000 to 10,000 is sort of the average, that's kind of roughly what we've plugged in. But of course, we're always trying to beat that and either for outperformance or for just kind of the way the days fell and so forth. We've been able to come above that in the last several quarters. Yes. But I think also as we said in the prepared remarks, I mean we -- despite, I think, this hurricane hit in the beginning of October, we were off to a fast start Q4. Yes. Let me comment on just kind of where we're investing. And then maybe, Mike, you can comment on sort of what it looks like in '25. Look, we've -- there's obviously a lot areas of investment and expanding clinical trials, investing heavily into innovation, user experience, customer service, new patient portals, EMR connectivity, expanding, I think, certain areas of marketing, certain areas where it makes sense to add a handful of salespeople here or there, maybe more significant expansions. So we're doing all those things. And like we said, we're in the very early stages of this opportunity. And we plan on investing in order to be able to serve as many patients as possible with our tests, and we're making those investments. Mike, do you want to talk about '25? Yes. I'll comment and then you have extra. But yes, I would say that's about right. I mean, look, there's we already have, I think, a pretty big presence from a commercial standpoint in women's health, and we built that over the last 12 years or so. Obviously, we're sometimes able to kind of add an additional medical science liaisons or genetic counselors, medical directors, maybe do some new clinical trials and do innovative things like we did with the [ residual disease ] test that we -- was a very time of launch and able to help a lot of patients. But largely, yes, we're focusing on I think, helping oncology patients, and we see that Signatera is really making an impact on care, and we're seeing that it's at the very early stages, and that's where a lot of the spending is going, both when you look at additional clinical trials, you look at research and development, you look at innovation, you look at sort of we already do have a big commercial presence there, but you look at sort of rounding that out, that's where a lot of the spending is going. Yes. I think it's been pretty consistent, but certainly, what drives utilization broadly is peer-reviewed evidence. And where we're able to generate data, which we've done a lot of. I think we now have more than 85 publications supporting the use of the Signatera technology where we're able to generate data, that tends to be kind of where you see physicians using the product. And that makes sense, right? You want to have the evidence-based decision-making. So some of the areas that we talked about, muscle invasive bladder, we're excited about that with IMvigor010 being, I think, a very strong study itself and now with the IMvigor011 data reading out in 2025, as Alex mentioned, I think that's a great opportunity. Of course, IO monitoring is another area where we do see quite a bit of utilization we generated some good data there. So yes, it's a mix. It's one of the reasons why I think there's still some upside opportunity from getting coverage even from Medicare on additional indications is that we do have a decent chunk of utilization that's outside of the currently covered indications. Yes. I'll just comment on penetration. I mean, look, obviously, it's slightly different by tumor type and then whether you're talking about sort of the adjuvant setting or new incident patients or the prevalent pool of patients. But looking broadly at the bigger opportunity, I mean, we still think we're in the low single digits. So there's a ton of opportunity ahead in community and academic settings. And we are adding sales team members in additional to medical team members and doing more clinical trials, which is a big part of our investment. Yes. We've got, I think, a very solid road map of data that's going to be reading out. So not just across those indications, but I think a broad sort of span of indications. We've got pretty big data sets reading out, which we're excited about. So I think right now, there's probably over 100 trials that are underway that are going to be reading out the various time points. So we're excited about that. We're excited about generating evidence that can drive additional coverage from Medicare and that can drive additional utilization."

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Chapman: Great. Thanks, Mike. Let's get to the highlights on the next slide. We had another excellent quarter across the board. Revenues were up 12% sequentially versus Q1 of 2024 and up 58% compared to Q2 of last year. This was driven by record volumes and another strong quarter of ASP growth. Volumes were up over 23% compared to Q2 of last year. We had a great quarter winning new accounts in women's health and despite the typical Q2 seasonal headwinds, we grew volume sequentially versus Q1. In organ health, we posted another strong volume quarter. And in oncology, Signatera grew another roughly 13,000 clinical units over what was a very strong Q1. We delivered a strong gross margin quarter with excellent ASP and COGS trends that I'll get into shortly. All of that means we can raise our guidance in revenues and gross margin for the full year. We are now centering the guide around roughly $1.5 billion in revenue and a 55% gross margin. At the midpoint, the new guide implies annual revenue growth of nearly 40% and an increase in gross margins of roughly 10 percentage points from the 45% gross margin we posted last year. We're excited about our progress and our transformational year continues. We also had many positive developments on the clinical and product side that we'll discuss on today's call. First, I want to flag that the ALTAIR investigators let us know that they are not going to make the time line for the submission to ESMO in mid-September. As you know, there's a huge amount of patient review and data analysis to generate the results and ready them for presentation, and the circular investigator team needs more time to get everything going. Their current plan is to target ASCO GI in January, so we'll stand by and let them do their work. In the meantime, we have an extremely full calendar of important data readouts in colorectal and other cancers, and we'll spend time reviewing that today. This includes the very significant 36-month readout from the GALAXY study, which we believe is of critical importance because it marks the first prospective overall survival data readout for Signatera in colorectal cancer. These results will be shared at ESMO. In addition, Solomon will provide an update on organ health and some recent news on Prospera and Renasight. He will discuss a major win with the new consensus paper published by the National Kidney Foundation that recommends genetic testing for the majority of patients with kidney disease. We also launched a new differentiated feature for our Prospera Heart Test that enhances the detection of organ rejection for heart transplant patients and allows us to deliver a more accurate risk assessment across both acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection, then with donor-derived cell-free DNA percentage alone. And finally, on the legal front, the Federal Appeals Court in July upheld the preliminary injunction of the RaDaR MRD assay made by NeoGenomics. As a reminder, the preliminary injunction was first issued by the District Court late last year. So this recent decision upholds that order, borrowing sales of the assay with limited exceptions. We are pleased with the outcome and look forward to presenting our case to the jury next year. Okay. Let's get into some of the business drivers on the next slide. The first slide shows the year-over-year volume progression we've had over time, both in terms of growth rates and absolute unit growth. This quarter looks like one of the best Q2 results we've had in the last 5 years. As a reminder, volumes from our existing women's health customers usually declined 5% to 10% compared to Q1 because clinics see fewer new pregnancies in Q2. Given the large book of existing business we have in women's health that drag of same-store sales volume is hard to overcome with new account wins. So I was particularly pleased to see the new volume growth in women's health above and beyond our strong quarter in Q1. The outperformance was partly enabled by our differentiated new product features, especially the Noninvasive Fetal RHD analysis, which we launched in May in the midst of a nationwide shortage of program that continues to affect the industry today. We continue to see very strong interest in our core women's health products, Panorama where we're the market leader in NIPT; at Horizon, where we're the market leader in expanded carrier screening. In addition to that organic growth, we got a full quarter contribution from Invitae deal that we announced in January, which further boosted our growth in the quarter. We also saw another great quarter for both Prospera and Renasight. We continue to perform well here and growth is accelerating. Of course, Signatera was a major source of growth in the quarter, and we had another outstanding result in clinical volumes as you can see on the next slide. The left-hand chart is the total oncology volume metric we've always shown, which includes Signatera clinical as well as Altera orders in pharma clinical trial units. The right-hand chart shows the quarterly volume progression of the clinical setting over time. You can see in the past, we typically have added about 8,000 or 9,000 units per quarter. We had a big step-up in Q1, and now we followed that with roughly 13,000 sequential units in Q2. While we still think roughly 8,000 to 10,000 units of quarterly growth is the right baseline expectation going forward clearly, the experience physicians and patients are having with Signatera continues to drive meaningful adoption. So, all that volume growth helped us to drive one of the best Q2 revenue growth performances in recent memory. This next slide shows the Q1 to Q2 change in revenue in the last 2 years, alongside the 2024 results. In addition to the volume trends, we continue to see very positive trends in ASPs really across the businesses. Signatera ASPs were up modestly over Q1, but we're modeling some additional growth ASPs for the rest of the year as we've seen some continued positive momentum from both Medicare Advantage plans and biomarker state reimbursement that can be a source of upside through the year. Women's health ASPs were very strong once again this quarter. Even without the tailwind of potential new guidelines, which we're still very positive on, we continue to make improvements on the fracture of cases that are getting reimbursed. That has been a major undertaken internally, and we made substantial investments in data analysis, engineering and persistent appeals and payer outreach to make that happen. We model women's health ASPs remaining stable through the rest of the year but we have a list of projects that may provide upside as we work through them. All of this effort is driving cash collections in excess of the revenue accruals we set last year, which is why we are seeing these revenue true-ups in 2024. These true-ups will be lumpy, and so we don't include future true-ups in our guidance, but they do represent execution above our prior expectations. While the ASPs improve, we continue to benefit from the efforts of our R&D team to reduce our cost of goods sold. Signatera COGS modestly declined again in the quarter and are now just above $400, and our women's health COGS remained in the range we achieved in prior quarters. The net result is that we had another record gross margin quarter. This slide shows both the total gross margins as well as the underlying gross margins and net of revenue true-ups and both metrics tell the same story. Underlying organic gross margins grew about 2 full percentage points above the Q1 results and now stand above 54%. The next slide shows our cash burn trajectory over time. For those of you that are newer to the story, you can see that historically, we made substantial initial investments to launch Signatera. And now we are getting scale on that commercial and operational base, while women's health continues to generate cash. We are very pleased to be cash flow breakeven for the second consecutive quarter, which is above our expectations given the potential for seasonal headwinds in Q2. Looking into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to hit the guide of cash flow breakeven for the full year even when incorporating the stepped up investment in R&D and sales, we announced in May. I'll say this again. We did not get to cash flow breakeven by flashing investments in our future. Our strategy is to keep our foot on the gas and to make sure we're doing everything we need to deliver fantastic products for our patients. With that, let me hand the call over to Solomon to cover organ health and commercial updates from oncology. Solomon?\nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with updates on organ health. Since we launched the Renasight test in 2020 for renal genetics, key trial data and now society guidelines have reinforced the importance of genetic testing for the 37 million patients in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease or CKD. We are pleased to share that the National Kidney Foundation published a new consensus paper last week with a strong endorsement for comprehensive genetic testing in the majority of patients with CKD. The consensus paper included input from experts in nephrology, clinical and lab genetics, kidney pathology and genetic counseling in addition to patients who also provided their perspectives. The NKF paper recommended a broad multi-gene panel as the primary choice for testing. Natera agrees with that position and our Renasight test covers 385 genes. NKF also clearly recognized the clinical utility and benefits of genetic testing across a wide range of renal conditions and patient characteristics. We, too, reported on that strong utility in our recent RenaCARE trial, which showed 1 out of 5 patients with a positive genetic diagnosis, 1 out of 2 positives leading to a change in diagnosis and 1 out of 3 positive cases leading to a change in therapy. The NKF paper follows the recent guideline update from KDIGO, which we spoke about on our earnings call in May. So this means we now have support for genetic testing from two of the major organizations in nephrology. We believe these recommendations will continue to have a positive impact on clinical adoption of the Renasight test. Moving on to Prospera, where we are seeing multiple account wins in kidney, heart and lung. Following some turbulence last year after changes in Medicare reimbursement, we see the market has fully rebounded and on a positive growth trajectory, and we believe Prospera is taking a disproportionate share of the growth. I would like to highlight that we recently launched a product enhancement for our heart transplant test called DQS or donor quantity score. Previously, Prospera Heart reported out the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA in the blood compared to the total cfDNA, but the donor fraction can be influenced by fluctuations in background cell-free DNA. For example, patients who are fighting off an infection, a malignancy or who just underwent surgery, all of those could cause the background levels of cell-free DNA to vary. With DQS, we have a second threshold, which is independent of those background cell-free DNA levels. This feature was previously introduced for Prospera Kidney and now it's available for Prospera Heart, too. In a study presented at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation in April, we showed that the addition of DQS increased Prospera's sensitivity to rejection in heart transplant from 80% to 88%, and it also reduced false positives by approximately 37%. We plan to submit the study for peer-reviewed publication later this year. This new and improved test enables clear clinical decisions and fewer unnecessary biopsies, all using BDC FD&A. Turning now to oncology. On the commercial front, as Steve noted, we saw excellent growth for Signatera clinical volumes driven by multiple factors. We saw another impressive increase in the number of ordering physicians with over 40% of all oncologists in the U.S. ordering at least 1 Signatera test during the quarter. There was also strong growth in new patient initiation, which was observed across all major disease indications led especially by colorectal cancer and breast cancer. This growth is being driven by the core value proposition of Signatera to inform risk-based treatment decisions in the adjuvant setting after surgery, to monitor for recurrence in conjunction with standard imaging, enabling earlier interventions. For example, over 85% of colorectal cancer recurrences are historically caught too late for curative intent surgery, which is the preferred treatment approach. And number three, to monitor for response to neoadjuvant therapy and immunotherapy. We're also investing heavily in user experience. Record numbers of customers are choosing mobile phlebotomy and engaging with Natera through our digital portals and EMR integrations. And test results are being delivered reliably in under 3 weeks from the time of specimen receipt for initial cases and under a week for subsequent cases. One final note on the commercial side. I want to comment on our partnership with Foundation Medicine. The deal with Foundation was originally signed in 2019 and was up for renewal this summer. For business reasons, the companies have decided not to renew the agreement. This allows Natera to maintain our focus on growing Signatera, Altera and Empower and adding new cutting-edge products services to our oncology portfolio. For continuity of care, we will continue monitoring services for any existing F1 tracker patients. Now I'll turn it over to Alex to discuss our clinical road map in oncology. Alex?\nAlexey Aleshin: Thanks, Solomon. Operational improvements and volume growth in the oncology business continued to outperform our expectations, and the clinical utility of Signatera continues to gain traction based on the core value proposition from the previous slide. At the ASCO meeting in June, Signatera was featured in over a dozen publications. And I wanted to highlight one particular multi-institutional study from UCLA and other academic institutions that really nicely delineates this clinical utility. As highlighted on this slide, this study examined 464 patients with Stage I to III breast cancer. The vast majority of the patients tested Signatera negative, offering valuable reassurance in a time of high anxiety. And the 12% of patients who tested Signatera-positive, investigators reported a treatment change in 91% of these patients with evidence that treatment change resulted in possibly improved outcomes. Some of you will remember the INTERCEPT study in colorectal cancer from MD Anderson. This study is very similar but in breast cancer. This is a great showcase of how Signatera is being adopted into clinical practice and having a positive impact for patients across the country. We are also pleased to publish several new peer-reviewed publications during this quarter, including the expanded EBLIS study, which we discussed in the Q1 call. But since then, there have also been new studies in muscle invasive bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma. The latter two represent first-time publications for Signatera in these disease indications, and we believe they are both areas of significant clinical unmet need. For example, in the Merkel cell carcinoma paper, Signatera testing after curative treatment was associated with significantly higher risk of recurrence. The hazard ratio reported was 7.4. This outperformed established Merkel cell carcinoma risk factors currently being utilized by clinicians. We look forward to presenting these new indications to Medicare later this year adding to the multiple submissions that are currently under review, and we will provide an update on these submissions in the future. Looking ahead to future data readouts. We have a strong pipeline of prospective randomized trials that we believe could, if successful, further change clinical practice in the United States and globally. As Steve mentioned, the ALTAIR investigators notified us of the need for more time for data review, analysis and interpretation. So they plan to delay the study readout to ASCO GI in January. We defer to the PIs on the timing and look forward to announcing these results at that time. Meanwhile, we are looking forward to the readout of the new GALAXY data at the ESMO conference in September with 36-month outcomes being reported in over 2,000 patients, and mature overall survival data being presented in addition to disease-free survival data. This will be the first time prospective overall survival data in colorectal cancer will be presented. Looking forward to 2025, 2026 and beyond, we have a full suite of Phase III studies in colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer, including both escalation and treatment on molecular recurrence studies. Furthermore, we have trials focused on de-escalation and some trials that span both of these indications. In bladder cancer, we're expecting the IMvigor011 trial to read out in 2025 with the MODERN trial also continuing to enroll well after being recently opened. We also have important breast cancer trials that we've previously presented on. This is just a snapshot of our data pipeline, and we continue to invest in generating high-quality clinical evidence to achieve our vision of Signatera as part of standard clinical practice. I also want to provide an update on our early cancer detection program. We continue to make progress in developing a differentiated blood-based assay to detect colorectal cancer. We are finishing a study utilizing prospectively collected colonoscopy matched average-risk blood samples supplemented by colorectal cancer samples. We look forward to sharing these results in the near future, and I will provide further details on our plans at that time. Now I will turn it over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike?\nMike Brophy: Great. Thanks, Alex. The next slide is just a summary of the P&L in Q2 and the year-over-year progress. Steve covered the key points on revenues and margins. On the expense lines, just as a reminder, we've made several growth-oriented investments in SG&A over the past year. For example, taking up the women's health sales team from Invitae, which is working out very well. We also had a modest step up in R&D in clinical trials. These measured increases in OpEx are consistent with the Q1 guide, and I think are indicative of how we would like to proceed for the time being. We'd like to maximize investments to grow revenues and margins while holding our cash balance relatively constant. That's what we achieved here in the second quarter that we were able to break even despite the seasonal headwinds that Steve described, and our cash balance actually grew slightly with interest income. Okay, let's get to the revised financial guidance on the next slide. On revenues, we are now expecting $1.49 billion to $1.52 billion. This represents a bump of $70 million at the midpoint as compared to the roughly $30 million beat in the quarter when removing revenue true-ups Steve talked about. The annual revenue guide now implies about 40% revenue growth versus 2023. The guide also implies we are bullish on the second half of the year, and we are off to a good start so far in Q3. On pacing, we expect steady sequential growth in volumes and revenue in Q3 and Q4. Our guide always assumes 0 and true-up revenues in future periods. And if we continue to generate cash above our expectations in the second half, any true-ups would represent upside to our guidance. We are also modeling largely stable ASPs in the second half for the overall business. So we do expect to see continued modest sequential improvement in the Signatera ASP, given the current momentum that Steve described. We are leaving the OpEx guide and the cash guide unchanged versus Q1, and we are still on track to make all the necessary growth investments we have planned for this year. I'll repeat my disclaimer on cash burn. Now that we are operating at this breakeven level, it's important to understand that we expect to have fluctuations in quarterly cash burn due to timing of capital expenditures and working capital. The timing of reimbursement from payers can easily vary in a given quarter. So I wouldn't be surprised to have a quarter where we have negative cash flow and others where we are positive and the guide just represents the full year results. The income statement, of course, is less prone to these swings. And so I expect our losses to continue to gradually narrow through the course of the year. Okay. So with that, we're very pleased with the quarter and happy to take your questions. Let me hand it to the operator. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Brennan from Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great, thank you. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for the question. Maybe just on the clinical trial readouts on ALTAIR and GALAXY. I appreciate the ALTAIR readouts delayed just due to the PIs maybe more time. But is there anything to read into this at all from either given the time that they need from either the PFS or the OS that you might see coming out of this trial? And then on GALAXY, OS would be something, I understand this is an observational trial, not a randomized trial. So how do we think about the expectation here if we see an OS benefit, what that could actually mean either for kind of doctor usage and/or NCCN?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Good question. So yes, on ALTAIR, I mean there's obviously a lot of work to do to get the patient data together and complete the analysis. And I think the time line leading into ESMO was just a little bit too tight. So the PIs want to move to the next kind of large-scale conference, which is ASCO GI. And of course, we support that. But we're definitely excited about reading out the GALAXY 36-month data at ESMO. And I think for having the first perspective, overall survival data readout on Signatera is going to be a big milestone, and it's something that we're really excited about. So Alex, do you want to talk a little bit more about I think this readout coming up at ESMO?\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes, definitely, Steve. Thanks for the question. For colorectal cancer and adjuvant setting 3-month -- 3-year DFS is usually considered kind of the gold standard as we think about predicting overall survival. And I think the timing is perfect in that the overall survival data from the GALAXY cohort is also now maturing and we're able to read it out. So we think that kind of provides 2 big upsides. I think the first it shows kind of how Signatera results predict with long-term outcomes, both DFS and OS. And it also builds a framework for looking at CTA dynamics as possible surrogates for future clinical trial development?\nDan Brennan: Great. And then if I have a follow-up just on pricing. True-ups have been obviously a big driver here in the last two quarters. I know you don't guide for that. Any way to characterize what that opportunity could look like? And then Mike, on Signatera price in the back half of the year, it sounds like I think from the last call, you were assuming flat pricing now, maybe you're assuming a step up in price. Maybe just discuss if anything changed there?\nMike Brophy: Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, on the true-ups, it wouldn't surprise me to see us have some additional true-ups. But again, they're just -- because they're hard to forecast is really more the reason why we don't guide to them. I do expect that to moderate. I mean, we stepped up ASPs very meaningfully in response to the better cash collections that we've seen over the last 18 months or so. So I think as the ASPs go up, hopefully, the more of that revenue is showing to the accrual rather than a true-up a year later. But nonetheless, I mean, this will be kind of a process, I think so that's on true-ups. On pricing, yes. I mean, look, we've seen continued progress with the reimbursement for Signatera. And we think that, that can yield some -- the guide presumes some modest step ups in the ASP in the second half but not something heroic beyond what we think is imminently achievable just based on reimbursement from Medicare and Medicare Advantage payers.\nDan Brennan: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Thank you guys for taking the questions. So first up on women's health, great to see the continued progress there this quarter, especially given the typical seasonality dynamics. So can you break out for us what was the contribution from the fetal test that you guys highlighted? And then also on the Invitae side, can you walk us through how much did Invitae benefit? You talked about some of the increasing of the salesforce there. So how should we think about that contribution in the back half?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks a lot. So yes, we were really excited to launch the fetal RHD test. It seemed like we were meeting what is -- continues to be a very significant unmet need. And we've seen a lot of interest in -- continuing interest, particularly, I think, leading to us closing new customers. And one of the things that drove this outperformance in Q2 was an increase in new customers as we came out of Q1, and then that continued on in Q2. And a lot of that is from the organic growth of the women's health business. So of course, Invitae made a contribution. I think we said in towards Q1 that Invitae was maybe like 25% of the women's health growth or something in that range. And I think it's similar in Q2 as now we're getting a full quarter of the Invitae volume coming in. But a lot of the new volume coming in is organic growth that we're just continuing to see interest in the Natera prenatal portfolio.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then just on my follow-up, you had another really solid quarter on the gross margin front. So I guess, how should we think about this progress continuing into the back half of the year? And can you kind of break down for us, especially on the Signatera side. You've mentioned some of the COGS dynamics. How much of that gross margin progression on Signatera was due to getting into the subsequent test for patients versus that first test where you really do the whole sequencing bit on the patient versus further operational efficiencies? And how do we think about that into the back half?\nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMike Brophy: Yes, sure. So yes, you're right. The gross margin guide is influenced, of course, by continued improvement in the Signatera gross margin. But I'd also highlight that the women's health ASPs are looking quite strong, as Steve kind of mentioned in the call, we're very gratified to see that. Specifically, on the Signatera gross margin dynamics. We saw another kind of modest step down in the COGS for Signatera sequentially versus Q1. And a lot of that, I think, is really kind of related to kind of the scale and the volume that we're seeing. There's still, I think, room to run in terms of reducing the COGS associated with running the tissue in-house, particularly as we stand up to Austin lab where we really get scale in that facility. So I think that's a positive driver for the back half. And I think if you just kind of -- in terms of the gross margin progression, if you just kind of think about the underlying kind of non true-up progression we've seen here. I think you could still see kind of modest sequential improvement in that kind of underlying trend sequentially in Q3 and Q4. That's what the model implies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions and if you don't mind, I'll ask both of them together on ALTAIR, I just wanted to understand perspective from Alex. How should -- I mean I appreciate that it's getting pushed out. But just in terms of overall benchmarking of this 240 patients trial, 80% powered to deliver DFS at a hazard ratio of 0.67. Is that the right benchmark? You've talked about the MOSAIQ trial before where Natera wasn't involved, but maybe just tell us how should we benchmark this? And then a second question follow-up for Mike is on gross margin. What's behind the 54% to 56% gross margin estimate? I appreciate there is a true-up difference here. But is there anything else beyond that, that we need to consider? Thank you.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Puneet. Yes, Alex, why don't you go ahead and talk about what good looks like and then you can hand it to Mike.\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes. Thanks, Puneet, for the question. I think as we've previously discussed and I think we stand by that benchmark. Mosaic is, we think, the best kind of DFS number to really target. I think that study showed a DFS of 0.0 0.77. And it was the last study that led to a change in treatment guidelines in the adjuvant setting. So we think that's still the right number. And I think we are just awaiting the final results to be generated and reported out by the investigators, and we continue to look forward to those when they're available.\nMike Brophy: On the gross margin, yes, I mean, I think the key delta to me is just that the second half could just presume 0 and true-ups, right. So that's a key difference between first half and second half. I do think that backing out the true-ups, as I've mentioned, I think it's kind of the organic kind of underlying gross margin. I think there's room for there to be sequential improvement both in Q3 and Q4. And so the guide is a blend of those couple of variables. So pretty bullish on the kind of organic underlying gross margin progression.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Got it. And if I could just squeeze a quick one around FMI. With the partnership termination, does that change your volume growth expectation for Altera or any impact on Signatera?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, thanks. That's a good question. No, we mentioned we're not continuing the partnership going forward, and it doesn't change our guidance or our volume forecast at all in any way.\nPuneet Souda: All right, guys. Congrats. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening and thanks for the time here. Sticking with the Signatera theme, Alex, can you share some color on just in light of the delay here and ASCO GI, I think it's Jan 23rd. Is early next year the right time frame for when we can expect a top line readout from you guys? And then in terms of framing that readout, right? So should the trial not meet that sort of 0.77 hazard ratio bar, you talked about, do you think we could still get enough evidence from the subgroup level analysis to demonstrate that Signatera performed as it should and it was the drug that failed to meet the bar. Just any color on those 2 points would be great.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So maybe I'll comment on the readout and then, Alex, you can talk about the performance. So yes, I think as we've got a ways out here now from ASCO GI, which is the next major conference. And as we get closer there, we'll kind of discuss the communication plan. I think we were planning to read out top line results if they were available a couple of weeks before the conference, but we'll meet with the PIs and decide what we want to do as we get a little closer to ASCO GI. Alex, do you want to talk about some of the subgroup analysis?\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes, definitely. So I think the first question about asset performance. Signatera is being used in GALAXY. Altera is obviously a portion of that study. We published on assay performance in GALAXY. We're updating the performance estimates at ESMO, and that will also be published. So in terms of assay performance concerns, I think the data is out there and it's been published, and I think that's what we expect. Now in terms of subgroup analyses, here, I just don't even want to speculate. I think we're awaiting the final results. And depending what the results show, subgroup analyses may be important, may not be important. They're pre-specified. So we'll take a look at those as soon as that data is available to us as well.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, one of your competitors recently talked about greater physician preference for tumor-naive approaches in the surveillance setting. Just due to apparently a lack of conviction that a tumor-informed approach can continue to provide relevant results given the time since diagnosis. So I'm just curious as to your take on that. And as we think about your MRD pipeline, you've got a few things in the hopper here. Is that one aspect that you will look to address either via an improved version of Signatera, perhaps a broader tumor informed panel or a tumor naive approach of your own?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we think at this point, the decision on whether tumor-informed or tumor naive is going to be more successful. I think it's pretty clear, right? If you just look at the volume and the physician interest in the marketplace. And a question about kind of tumor dynamics over time, that's not really relevant. I think generally, we're looking at coronal mutations that are present even if there's developments in the tumor over time. So I don't really think the way that it's being described is relevant. Look, we always keep our eye out on what's happening with competition, what's happening in the marketplace. And obviously, we've been successful doing innovative things and innovating and evolving products over time, and we'll continue to do that as the market evolves. But I think at this point, things are pretty clear, the tumor-informed approach is clearly the chosen approach by physician.\nTejas Savant: Got it. Super helpful, guys. One final one for me. Just on ACOG, Steve, as you think about that as a catalyst, I mean, it's still in the framework, but do you think it happens between now and year-end? Or you just don't know and there's a possibility that this could slip to 2025?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I think we still feel very positive about ACOG guidelines, both for carrier screening and on 22q, and that's really grounded in looking at the data, looking at physician preferences and looking at the studies that have been done. So I think you will -- well, we expect to see something this year, and we feel very strongly that things are coming.\nTejas Savant: Awesome. Thanks guys, appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. My first one is, do you expect ASPs in women's health to decline at all for the second half, assuming ASPs, you mentioned will be stable in the second half with the sequential step-up in Signatera ASPs?\nMike Brophy: Hey, it's Mike. I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. No, we actually kind of model kind of stable ASPs in the women's health space for the second half. So do not expect a decline, which as the long-term follower in the car will recall, and that's a little bit of a deviation from the way that we typically guide. We've historically guided to some erosion in the ASPs, but that's just inconsistent with the momentum that we've seen in the women's health space. We've seen just continued progress really across the board in getting that long tail of recalcitrant payers that just reimburse particularly for NIPT. Now that it's been kind of the standard of care for a few years now, you kind of get this kind of conversion of that long tail of payers, and we're definitely seeing that now. So feeling very good about the women's health ASPs at this time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then is the CIRCULATE-France study that you're expecting data from shortly? Is that similar to the CIRCULATE-Japan study does it also have an escalation and deescalation arm? And what are you expecting there incrementally that's potentially different from the Japan study?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. Alex, do you want to take that?\nAlexey Aleshin: Yes, absolutely. So CIRCULATE-France, we're looking at the lower risk Stage 2 patient population where the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is hotly debated. The majority of patients in the -- probably the world are now giving adjuvant chemotherapy, but many of these patients still recur. So that is a study that's randomizing Signatera-positive patients after surgery in that kind of narrow stage defined patient population to either receive adjuvant chemotherapy or follow kind of the standard of care, which is observation. So in many ways, I would say it's pretty different than ALTAIR and I was asking kind of a postoperative adjuvant question. There is no deescalation arm since, again, these patients as part of standard of care are not usually getting adjuvant chemotherapy. So the Signatera negative patients are being just followed and their outcomes are observed, but there is no randomized deescalation component.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And I forgot to mention this is Sean on for Matt. Thank you for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDouglas Schenkel: I want to just go through a few loose ends on Signatera. So -- actually, I want to come back to the topic of competition, but let me put that to the side for a second. What's the mix of first-time tests versus surveillance as we sit here today? When you talk about COGS improvement, I'm assuming that's independent of mix. So that gets better even more so over time as the mix shifts towards more surveillance. And then kind of building off of this, keeping in mind that you seem to be on track to go Signatera revenue over 80% year-over-year. If we think of how you've been tracking on first-time tests, and then think about the annual tail of 4 more predictable tests per year for surveillance purposes the following year, and then you stack that on top of new first-time test growth, doesn't that mathematically support an outlook for sustained 50% maybe more volume growth in the year ahead?\nMike Brophy: Thanks for the question, Doug. It's Mike. Yes, look, what we've seen is, first, when we launched ALTAIR, obviously, there's very few surveillance tests in the cohort. Then we've kind of grown to where historically, it's been kind of gotten to like a 50-50 kind of balance, and it has been quite stable there for some time. It's continued to evolve, but I would characterize it very broadly. It's still kind of in that zone where you have very high compliance of patients staying with Signatera into the surveillance setting. And I think steady state, that's probably the vast majority of your volume, 75%, 80% of your volumes, like over time, mature product would be that tail of patients kind of getting surveilled in the recurrence monitoring setting. We haven't seen that progression happen as rapidly as you might expect because the top of the funnel just keeps getting filled. I mean they just continue to be kind of new account when physicians adopting the test, new patients coming in the top of the funnel. And so that's kept that mix much more balanced, okay. And so to your point, I do think that it's kind of a unique dynamic, the fact that you've got this kind of long-term ongoing relationship with the patient where you stack up kind of classes of patients that stay with the test. It does support, I think, a longer-term outlook for growth potential that we're quite excited about because we think that can be extremely useful to patients over time. And you have the two-parter, and I'm only smart enough to remember one part. So I ask the second one again.\nDouglas Schenkel: So I mean I think it was essentially just the COGS improvements that you talked about, that's independent of mix. And I think you kind of just answered that because your mix is stable at 50-50. So I think we're going to like -- yes, exactly, yes. My follow-up is on competition. Garden reported data from the COSMOS study yesterday, specificity was 98%, sensitivity was 8. Recognizing that these studies are done in a way where it's hard to make perfect apples-to-apples comparisons. This seems to be well below certainly what we've seen in studies from you especially sensitivity, which, at least to me, looks like it was over 10 points lower. That said, Garden is clearly asserting that their study data is actually better than what we've seen with Signatera. Are you seeing anything that suggests this is equivalent or better than what you guys have presented and based on what's out there, what part of the market positioning would be at risk for you? And should we be contemplating any moderation in growth as folks potentially contemplate shifting to a study, which -- I'm sorry, an assay that may be more convenient. But from a performance standpoint, I think you'd have to once again view that convenience is more important than performance.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, thanks. So I guess I'll say Garden's been out since, I think, 2021 promoting their tests, and we've seen them in accounts. We've seen them in the field. And they announced, I think, the COSMOS results maybe in January of this year. So that's been out there for a while. It's good that they've gotten the paper published. We don't think the dynamic really changes much. They've been out -- they've had the data out for 7 months now. So I don't think it will impact much. We feel really good about our test performance. 50 peer-reviewed publications plus multiple further studies in the pipeline. We're seeing 40% of oncologists use the product. Great operations. Things are going really well.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. A couple of cleanups here. I guess going back to ALTAIR I just want to make sure I understand kind of the pacing here. I think you previously talked about the CRC committee for NCCN meeting this summer and incorporating all tier. Now that's pushed out to next year. How do you think about timing of NCCN? And do you still think this is kind of a driver versus strictly U.S.? So that's the first question.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I'll take that. So look, so first, we were happy to see Signatera and MRD testing being incorporated already as a footnote and NCCN based on the data that's out there. And we're excited about this 36-month perspective overall survival data that's going to be read out at ESMO, which we think is a very positive thing. The committee, I think, previously has said they're looking for overall survival data in a prospective manner. Of course, we're looking for randomized data as well, and that's what we're doing all of these randomized clinical trials. So we can't always predict what's going to happen with the NCCN committee. But certainly, doing all these studies, I think, puts us in a positive position. It's also important to remember, as Solomon described. I think, in his section, the different used cases of Signatera, right. So we have adjuvant decision-making, which is largely covered by the GALAXY study. We then have surveillance with the notion of doing surgery with curative intent if you find a recurrence. And that's -- those 2 things are really driving a lot of the utilization today. And then you have the Altera study, which is looking at sort of a new paradigm of treatment on molecular recurrence, but it's not necessarily the indication that's been driving all of the growth that we've seen today. So look, we'll have to see, but we're doing everything we can. We're putting ourselves in the right position by doing these studies to see guidelines and see impact over time.\nTycho Peterson: And then, I guess, on kind of used cases. I think last quarter, you talked about some bumps in bladder cancer, ovarian cancer. Ovarian on the back of Medicare coverage. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about some of those newer indications and if you're doing anything around kind of market development there?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we're actually seeing a lot of interest in these other areas. And one of the things I think that is great about the Signatera strategy is that we've been able to generate peer review data and get coverage in multiple different indications now. And in fact, in this last quarter, as Alex announced, we just had data on Merkel cell and now pancreatic cancer. So we're continuing to generate evidence in new tumor types, and those will all be submitted for MolDX. So when we've gotten coverage, we definitely see a bump as we go out and the sales team starts promoting in those indications. And then as we look towards 2025, actually, one of the exciting areas I think, is bladder cancer with the IMvigor011 results potentially being read out in 2025. So we continue to see a lot of interest across the board, and we think that the pan-cancer approach backed by strong clinical data is the right approach.\nTycho Peterson: Great. And then last one. Is it a little bit of a change in strategy on tumor naive for MRD? I think in the past, you talked about spending about $15 million this year on data sets and maybe some readouts just somewhere in the fall. Understanding, obviously, it's a smaller part of the market, not a huge focus, but I think you previously talked about spending on tumor naive.\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So I think what we've said before is that we're definitely kind of looking at the competition, understanding what's happening, understand what physicians are interested in. We definitely think tumor informed is, I think, a winning approach at this point. But certainly, we are aware of what's happening in the marketplace and what types of test physicians are using. I think we've said we're innovating and we're doing different things, and we expect to announce some different MRD enhancements and product line extensions in the future. And I think we'll just have to wait and kind of see what those are. As far as early cancer detection, I think that's generally where we've talked about having that spend in the range of like $10 million to $15 million and having some readouts coming later this year, and those are actually on track. So we expect in the very near future to be able to give a readout on our progress in early cancer detection, which we're excited about.\nTycho Peterson: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Maybe first on women's health ASPs, just regarding your comments on improving the fraction of tests you get paid on even without guidelines. Does that hold true on microdels? Are you seeing improved collections there? Or was that more of a carrier screening comment?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, Catherine, good question. I'd say that's not the case on microdels. I think there -- the improvement is really going to come from a guideline change. I think what we're talking about is where there's a covered test and maybe the payers aren't paying when they're supposed to. And you need to really do things with the payer to try to make sure you get paid, like, for example, collecting medical records, appealing after an unjust denial, things like that. And we're just getting better at that as time goes on and we learn more. But certainly, the upside on something that generally doesn't have coverage like microdeletions still rests with guidelines and getting coverage in place.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. Got it. And then for Signatera, you mentioned, I think, over 40% of oncologists ordered it in the second quarter. What percent have ordered it at all cumulatively since launch? What portion of your sequential volume growth was from new ordering physicians versus penetrating existing accounts?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. So we actually see, once doctors start using Signatera, they're generally pretty consistent. But obviously, there's groups across the board that have different ordering patterns. But I would say the typical pattern is they trial it out on a couple of patients. They like the experience, they see the clinical utility and then they start expanding into their practice, into other patients. Maybe other doctors within the practice start ordering the test. And then maybe they move beyond colorectal, would be around breast to other tumor types. And so I would say that once people get on board, generally, there's a very strong rate of recurrent orders and expansion within those practices. Now with that said, we definitely track new physicians coming on board, and we see a very healthy pipeline there of new physicians coming in with interest that maybe they were waiting for more data to come out, maybe they just -- they hadn't decided on the right timing for them to use it yet, but we're certainly seeing a lot of new people come in, in addition to expansion within the physicians that are currently using.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Subbu Nambi from Guggenheim. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSubbu Nambi: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Do you believe that the delay in the Altera readout will have any impact on market demand? I don't think so, but just wanted to confirm any signs that clinicians were holding off on adopting pending the readout?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that's a good question. So just as a reminder, what Altera is studying is sort of a new paradigm, which is treatment on molecular recurrence where you would need to go get approval for this particular drug to be used without clinical relapse. And so the vast, vast majority of the usage that we've seen today and the growth that we're seeing is based on different indications. And those indications are adjuvant decision-making, where the doctor is trying to make a decision about whether to give adjuvant chemotherapy or not. That's not being studied in Altera or just standard surveillance and recurrence monitoring for the intent of doing surgery because in colorectal cancer, in a significant portion of the patients, if you catch the cancer early, you can actually do surgery. And in many cases, the patients can be cured just from that surgery alone. So neither of those 2 indications are being studied in Altera. So the delay, obviously, won't have any impact on the current status quo. And I think we remain excited about reading the results out as we turn the corner into 2025 and potentially expanding the market opportunity further.\nSubbu Nambi: Okay. That's super helpful. And consistently, our checks on Altera trial, it appears that even if it reads out positive, it could be practice changing just like what you said, a new use case. But if it reads out negative, Signatera ordering behavior wouldn't be impacted because I think they point out the trial design is complicated and there are multiple subgroups. Is this how you're thinking about it internally?\nSteve Chapman: Yes. I mean, look, we've thought about it as potentially opening up a new area of growth. This idea of sort of treatment on molecular recurrence. And I think that's really the view of how we're looking at things. And of course, the core volume growth today and all the utilization or the vast majority utilization that we're seeing. And we're still very, very underpenetrated, I think, are on adjuvant decision-making and recurrence monitoring with the intent to do surgery. So we'll have to see how things go after the data reads out and what additional uptake we get from this.\nSubbu Nambi: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eve Burstein from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nEve Burstein: Great. Two for you. First one, you said that your base case is to add 9,000 to 10,000 Signatera tests per quarter. At this point, though, you've had two quarters in a row with test growth, clearly well above that. So two parts to this. One is part of the reason you've given for anchoring on that 9,000 to 10,000 members because you don't plan to increase your salesforce. But you're clearly seeing interest from the market. So why not increase salesforce at this point? And then two, given that strong tailwind from surveillance, even if you don't increase sales force, you'll have that working in your favor. So don't you think it's reasonable to increase the base case at this point?\nSteve Chapman: Yes, that's a good question. And look, we're in a very underpenetrated market. There's lots of demand. We've been growing. We have seen two really strong quarters in a row, a very solid volume growth. But look, I think we have to just kind of stay conservative with our expectations as we normally are and try to outperform them, which we generally have been able to do. But look, it's hard to -- you can't judge things on a quarter-to-quarter basis because there's -- sometimes there's a different number of receiving days. Sometimes there's holidays. Sometimes there's big major conferences where doctors are at. And so I think part of the point of just sort of reiterating kind of the base case is just because things can fluctuate every quarter. But when you take a step back, you look at an annual basis, I think that's kind of probably a better way to look at things. But of course, we've given the same pitch before about the 8,000 to 9,000. I think we reiterated that in Q1, and then we delivered 13,000 units of growth. So it's just a kind of a standard baseline that we keep reiterating and has nothing to do with sort of our views on exactly how the next particular quarter is going.\nEve Burstein: Got it. Thanks. As a follow-up -- following up on the partnership with Foundation, you said that deciding not to renew that isn't changing your guidance or your forecast in any way. That partnership made a lot of sense strategically because you could piggyback off the 150,000 or 200,000 therapy selection tests they were doing and Altera is clearly well below that. So if you're not changing your forecast, it makes me think that the partnership wasn't really delivering a ton of value. Why not? And why not sort of fix the things that weren't going right for you? And then what, if anything, will you plan to change about your Altera marketing going forward to try to drive volumes there? Because I imagine that they, in turn, really could drive volumes for Signatera.\nSteve Chapman: Yes, I would say, look, when you look back to when we signed the partnership back in 2019, I mean, things have really changed quite a bit since then, right. So Signatera growth has accelerated and grown immensely. And we're just in a very different place than we were back when we sell that partnership. And as a reminder, we were running the plasma test, but the partner laboratory was responsible for commercial distribution. And that can be a challenging situation to be in. And I think for business reasons, both sides decided that it didn't make sense to continue. But like I said, it doesn't impact our forecast. We're focusing on Signatera, the opportunity that we have with Altera, which I think we're doing really well on. We continue to do really well in immunotherapy monitoring where we've had very strong data where a lot of times, we see the Altera being ordered alongside those immunotherapy monitoring patients. So we're continuing to move forward in that indication, but it just doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to continue the partnership. It's sort of -- yes, we'll move it along.\nEve Burstein: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. This will conclude today's conference call.

            "name": "Solomon Moshkevich",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with updates on organ health. Since we launched the Renasight test in 2020 for renal genetics, key trial data and now society guidelines have reinforced the importance of genetic testing for the 37 million patients in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease or CKD. We are pleased to share that the National Kidney Foundation published a new consensus paper last week with a strong endorsement for comprehensive genetic testing in the majority of patients with CKD. The consensus paper included input from experts in nephrology, clinical and lab genetics, kidney pathology and genetic counseling in addition to patients who also provided their perspectives. The NKF paper recommended a broad multi-gene panel as the primary choice for testing. Natera agrees with that position and our Renasight test covers 385 genes. NKF also clearly recognized the clinical utility and benefits of genetic testing across a wide range of renal conditions and patient characteristics. We, too, reported on that strong utility in our recent RenaCARE trial, which showed 1 out of 5 patients with a positive genetic diagnosis, 1 out of 2 positives leading to a change in diagnosis and 1 out of 3 positive cases leading to a change in therapy. The NKF paper follows the recent guideline update from KDIGO, which we spoke about on our earnings call in May. So this means we now have support for genetic testing from two of the major organizations in nephrology. We believe these recommendations will continue to have a positive impact on clinical adoption of the Renasight test. Moving on to Prospera, where we are seeing multiple account wins in kidney, heart and lung. Following some turbulence last year after changes in Medicare reimbursement, we see the market has fully rebounded and on a positive growth trajectory, and we believe Prospera is taking a disproportionate share of the growth. I would like to highlight that we recently launched a product enhancement for our heart transplant test called DQS or donor quantity score. Previously, Prospera Heart reported out the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA in the blood compared to the total cfDNA, but the donor fraction can be influenced by fluctuations in background cell-free DNA. For example, patients who are fighting off an infection, a malignancy or who just underwent surgery, all of those could cause the background levels of cell-free DNA to vary. With DQS, we have a second threshold, which is independent of those background cell-free DNA levels. This feature was previously introduced for Prospera Kidney and now it's available for Prospera Heart, too. In a study presented at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation in April, we showed that the addition of DQS increased Prospera's sensitivity to rejection in heart transplant from 80% to 88%, and it also reduced false positives by approximately 37%. We plan to submit the study for peer-reviewed publication later this year. This new and improved test enables clear clinical decisions and fewer unnecessary biopsies, all using BDC FD&A. Turning now to oncology. On the commercial front, as Steve noted, we saw excellent growth for Signatera clinical volumes driven by multiple factors. We saw another impressive increase in the number of ordering physicians with over 40% of all oncologists in the U.S. ordering at least 1 Signatera test during the quarter. There was also strong growth in new patient initiation, which was observed across all major disease indications led especially by colorectal cancer and breast cancer. This growth is being driven by the core value proposition of Signatera to inform risk-based treatment decisions in the adjuvant setting after surgery, to monitor for recurrence in conjunction with standard imaging, enabling earlier interventions. For example, over 85% of colorectal cancer recurrences are historically caught too late for curative intent surgery, which is the preferred treatment approach. And number three, to monitor for response to neoadjuvant therapy and immunotherapy. We're also investing heavily in user experience. Record numbers of customers are choosing mobile phlebotomy and engaging with Natera through our digital portals and EMR integrations. And test results are being delivered reliably in under 3 weeks from the time of specimen receipt for initial cases and under a week for subsequent cases. One final note on the commercial side. I want to comment on our partnership with Foundation Medicine. The deal with Foundation was originally signed in 2019 and was up for renewal this summer. For business reasons, the companies have decided not to renew the agreement. This allows Natera to maintain our focus on growing Signatera, Altera and Empower and adding new cutting-edge products services to our oncology portfolio. For continuity of care, we will continue monitoring services for any existing F1 tracker patients. Now I'll turn it over to Alex to discuss our clinical road map in oncology. Alex?"

            "name": "Alexey Aleshin",
            "content": "Thanks, Solomon. Operational improvements and volume growth in the oncology business continued to outperform our expectations, and the clinical utility of Signatera continues to gain traction based on the core value proposition from the previous slide. At the ASCO meeting in June, Signatera was featured in over a dozen publications. And I wanted to highlight one particular multi-institutional study from UCLA and other academic institutions that really nicely delineates this clinical utility. As highlighted on this slide, this study examined 464 patients with Stage I to III breast cancer. The vast majority of the patients tested Signatera negative, offering valuable reassurance in a time of high anxiety. And the 12% of patients who tested Signatera-positive, investigators reported a treatment change in 91% of these patients with evidence that treatment change resulted in possibly improved outcomes. Some of you will remember the INTERCEPT study in colorectal cancer from MD Anderson. This study is very similar but in breast cancer. This is a great showcase of how Signatera is being adopted into clinical practice and having a positive impact for patients across the country. We are also pleased to publish several new peer-reviewed publications during this quarter, including the expanded EBLIS study, which we discussed in the Q1 call. But since then, there have also been new studies in muscle invasive bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma. The latter two represent first-time publications for Signatera in these disease indications, and we believe they are both areas of significant clinical unmet need. For example, in the Merkel cell carcinoma paper, Signatera testing after curative treatment was associated with significantly higher risk of recurrence. The hazard ratio reported was 7.4. This outperformed established Merkel cell carcinoma risk factors currently being utilized by clinicians. We look forward to presenting these new indications to Medicare later this year adding to the multiple submissions that are currently under review, and we will provide an update on these submissions in the future. Looking ahead to future data readouts. We have a strong pipeline of prospective randomized trials that we believe could, if successful, further change clinical practice in the United States and globally. As Steve mentioned, the ALTAIR investigators notified us of the need for more time for data review, analysis and interpretation. So they plan to delay the study readout to ASCO GI in January. We defer to the PIs on the timing and look forward to announcing these results at that time. Meanwhile, we are looking forward to the readout of the new GALAXY data at the ESMO conference in September with 36-month outcomes being reported in over 2,000 patients, and mature overall survival data being presented in addition to disease-free survival data. This will be the first time prospective overall survival data in colorectal cancer will be presented. Looking forward to 2025, 2026 and beyond, we have a full suite of Phase III studies in colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer, including both escalation and treatment on molecular recurrence studies. Furthermore, we have trials focused on de-escalation and some trials that span both of these indications. In bladder cancer, we're expecting the IMvigor011 trial to read out in 2025 with the MODERN trial also continuing to enroll well after being recently opened. We also have important breast cancer trials that we've previously presented on. This is just a snapshot of our data pipeline, and we continue to invest in generating high-quality clinical evidence to achieve our vision of Signatera as part of standard clinical practice. I also want to provide an update on our early cancer detection program. We continue to make progress in developing a differentiated blood-based assay to detect colorectal cancer. We are finishing a study utilizing prospectively collected colonoscopy matched average-risk blood samples supplemented by colorectal cancer samples. We look forward to sharing these results in the near future, and I will provide further details on our plans at that time. Now I will turn it over to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Yes, definitely, Steve. Thanks for the question. For colorectal cancer and adjuvant setting 3-month -- 3-year DFS is usually considered kind of the gold standard as we think about predicting overall survival. And I think the timing is perfect in that the overall survival data from the GALAXY cohort is also now maturing and we're able to read it out. So we think that kind of provides 2 big upsides. I think the first it shows kind of how Signatera results predict with long-term outcomes, both DFS and OS. And it also builds a framework for looking at CTA dynamics as possible surrogates for future clinical trial development? Yes. Thanks, Puneet, for the question. I think as we've previously discussed and I think we stand by that benchmark. Mosaic is, we think, the best kind of DFS number to really target. I think that study showed a DFS of 0.0 0.77. And it was the last study that led to a change in treatment guidelines in the adjuvant setting. So we think that's still the right number. And I think we are just awaiting the final results to be generated and reported out by the investigators, and we continue to look forward to those when they're available. Yes, definitely. So I think the first question about asset performance. Signatera is being used in GALAXY. Altera is obviously a portion of that study. We published on assay performance in GALAXY. We're updating the performance estimates at ESMO, and that will also be published. So in terms of assay performance concerns, I think the data is out there and it's been published, and I think that's what we expect. Now in terms of subgroup analyses, here, I just don't even want to speculate. I think we're awaiting the final results. And depending what the results show, subgroup analyses may be important, may not be important. They're pre-specified. So we'll take a look at those as soon as that data is available to us as well. Yes, absolutely. So CIRCULATE-France, we're looking at the lower risk Stage 2 patient population where the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is hotly debated. The majority of patients in the -- probably the world are now giving adjuvant chemotherapy, but many of these patients still recur. So that is a study that's randomizing Signatera-positive patients after surgery in that kind of narrow stage defined patient population to either receive adjuvant chemotherapy or follow kind of the standard of care, which is observation. So in many ways, I would say it's pretty different than ALTAIR and I was asking kind of a postoperative adjuvant question. There is no deescalation arm since, again, these patients as part of standard of care are not usually getting adjuvant chemotherapy. So the Signatera negative patients are being just followed and their outcomes are observed, but there is no randomized deescalation component."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Let's get to the highlights on the next slide. We had another excellent quarter across the board. Revenues were up 12% sequentially versus Q1 of 2024 and up 58% compared to Q2 of last year. This was driven by record volumes and another strong quarter of ASP growth. Volumes were up over 23% compared to Q2 of last year. We had a great quarter winning new accounts in women's health and despite the typical Q2 seasonal headwinds, we grew volume sequentially versus Q1. In organ health, we posted another strong volume quarter. And in oncology, Signatera grew another roughly 13,000 clinical units over what was a very strong Q1. We delivered a strong gross margin quarter with excellent ASP and COGS trends that I'll get into shortly. All of that means we can raise our guidance in revenues and gross margin for the full year. We are now centering the guide around roughly $1.5 billion in revenue and a 55% gross margin. At the midpoint, the new guide implies annual revenue growth of nearly 40% and an increase in gross margins of roughly 10 percentage points from the 45% gross margin we posted last year. We're excited about our progress and our transformational year continues. We also had many positive developments on the clinical and product side that we'll discuss on today's call. First, I want to flag that the ALTAIR investigators let us know that they are not going to make the time line for the submission to ESMO in mid-September. As you know, there's a huge amount of patient review and data analysis to generate the results and ready them for presentation, and the circular investigator team needs more time to get everything going. Their current plan is to target ASCO GI in January, so we'll stand by and let them do their work. In the meantime, we have an extremely full calendar of important data readouts in colorectal and other cancers, and we'll spend time reviewing that today. This includes the very significant 36-month readout from the GALAXY study, which we believe is of critical importance because it marks the first prospective overall survival data readout for Signatera in colorectal cancer. These results will be shared at ESMO. In addition, Solomon will provide an update on organ health and some recent news on Prospera and Renasight. He will discuss a major win with the new consensus paper published by the National Kidney Foundation that recommends genetic testing for the majority of patients with kidney disease. We also launched a new differentiated feature for our Prospera Heart Test that enhances the detection of organ rejection for heart transplant patients and allows us to deliver a more accurate risk assessment across both acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection, then with donor-derived cell-free DNA percentage alone. And finally, on the legal front, the Federal Appeals Court in July upheld the preliminary injunction of the RaDaR MRD assay made by NeoGenomics. As a reminder, the preliminary injunction was first issued by the District Court late last year. So this recent decision upholds that order, borrowing sales of the assay with limited exceptions. We are pleased with the outcome and look forward to presenting our case to the jury next year. Okay. Let's get into some of the business drivers on the next slide. The first slide shows the year-over-year volume progression we've had over time, both in terms of growth rates and absolute unit growth. This quarter looks like one of the best Q2 results we've had in the last 5 years. As a reminder, volumes from our existing women's health customers usually declined 5% to 10% compared to Q1 because clinics see fewer new pregnancies in Q2. Given the large book of existing business we have in women's health that drag of same-store sales volume is hard to overcome with new account wins. So I was particularly pleased to see the new volume growth in women's health above and beyond our strong quarter in Q1. The outperformance was partly enabled by our differentiated new product features, especially the Noninvasive Fetal RHD analysis, which we launched in May in the midst of a nationwide shortage of program that continues to affect the industry today. We continue to see very strong interest in our core women's health products, Panorama where we're the market leader in NIPT; at Horizon, where we're the market leader in expanded carrier screening. In addition to that organic growth, we got a full quarter contribution from Invitae deal that we announced in January, which further boosted our growth in the quarter. We also saw another great quarter for both Prospera and Renasight. We continue to perform well here and growth is accelerating. Of course, Signatera was a major source of growth in the quarter, and we had another outstanding result in clinical volumes as you can see on the next slide. The left-hand chart is the total oncology volume metric we've always shown, which includes Signatera clinical as well as Altera orders in pharma clinical trial units. The right-hand chart shows the quarterly volume progression of the clinical setting over time. You can see in the past, we typically have added about 8,000 or 9,000 units per quarter. We had a big step-up in Q1, and now we followed that with roughly 13,000 sequential units in Q2. While we still think roughly 8,000 to 10,000 units of quarterly growth is the right baseline expectation going forward clearly, the experience physicians and patients are having with Signatera continues to drive meaningful adoption. So, all that volume growth helped us to drive one of the best Q2 revenue growth performances in recent memory. This next slide shows the Q1 to Q2 change in revenue in the last 2 years, alongside the 2024 results. In addition to the volume trends, we continue to see very positive trends in ASPs really across the businesses. Signatera ASPs were up modestly over Q1, but we're modeling some additional growth ASPs for the rest of the year as we've seen some continued positive momentum from both Medicare Advantage plans and biomarker state reimbursement that can be a source of upside through the year. Women's health ASPs were very strong once again this quarter. Even without the tailwind of potential new guidelines, which we're still very positive on, we continue to make improvements on the fracture of cases that are getting reimbursed. That has been a major undertaken internally, and we made substantial investments in data analysis, engineering and persistent appeals and payer outreach to make that happen. We model women's health ASPs remaining stable through the rest of the year but we have a list of projects that may provide upside as we work through them. All of this effort is driving cash collections in excess of the revenue accruals we set last year, which is why we are seeing these revenue true-ups in 2024. These true-ups will be lumpy, and so we don't include future true-ups in our guidance, but they do represent execution above our prior expectations. While the ASPs improve, we continue to benefit from the efforts of our R&D team to reduce our cost of goods sold. Signatera COGS modestly declined again in the quarter and are now just above $400, and our women's health COGS remained in the range we achieved in prior quarters. The net result is that we had another record gross margin quarter. This slide shows both the total gross margins as well as the underlying gross margins and net of revenue true-ups and both metrics tell the same story. Underlying organic gross margins grew about 2 full percentage points above the Q1 results and now stand above 54%. The next slide shows our cash burn trajectory over time. For those of you that are newer to the story, you can see that historically, we made substantial initial investments to launch Signatera. And now we are getting scale on that commercial and operational base, while women's health continues to generate cash. We are very pleased to be cash flow breakeven for the second consecutive quarter, which is above our expectations given the potential for seasonal headwinds in Q2. Looking into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to hit the guide of cash flow breakeven for the full year even when incorporating the stepped up investment in R&D and sales, we announced in May. I'll say this again. We did not get to cash flow breakeven by flashing investments in our future. Our strategy is to keep our foot on the gas and to make sure we're doing everything we need to deliver fantastic products for our patients. With that, let me hand the call over to Solomon to cover organ health and commercial updates from oncology. Solomon? Yes. Thanks, Dan. Good question. So yes, on ALTAIR, I mean there's obviously a lot of work to do to get the patient data together and complete the analysis. And I think the time line leading into ESMO was just a little bit too tight. So the PIs want to move to the next kind of large-scale conference, which is ASCO GI. And of course, we support that. But we're definitely excited about reading out the GALAXY 36-month data at ESMO. And I think for having the first perspective, overall survival data readout on Signatera is going to be a big milestone, and it's something that we're really excited about. So Alex, do you want to talk a little bit more about I think this readout coming up at ESMO? Yes. Thanks a lot. So yes, we were really excited to launch the fetal RHD test. It seemed like we were meeting what is -- continues to be a very significant unmet need. And we've seen a lot of interest in -- continuing interest, particularly, I think, leading to us closing new customers. And one of the things that drove this outperformance in Q2 was an increase in new customers as we came out of Q1, and then that continued on in Q2. And a lot of that is from the organic growth of the women's health business. So of course, Invitae made a contribution. I think we said in towards Q1 that Invitae was maybe like 25% of the women's health growth or something in that range. And I think it's similar in Q2 as now we're getting a full quarter of the Invitae volume coming in. But a lot of the new volume coming in is organic growth that we're just continuing to see interest in the Natera prenatal portfolio. Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. Thanks, Puneet. Yes, Alex, why don't you go ahead and talk about what good looks like and then you can hand it to Mike. Yes, thanks. That's a good question. No, we mentioned we're not continuing the partnership going forward, and it doesn't change our guidance or our volume forecast at all in any way. Yes. So maybe I'll comment on the readout and then, Alex, you can talk about the performance. So yes, I think as we've got a ways out here now from ASCO GI, which is the next major conference. And as we get closer there, we'll kind of discuss the communication plan. I think we were planning to read out top line results if they were available a couple of weeks before the conference, but we'll meet with the PIs and decide what we want to do as we get a little closer to ASCO GI. Alex, do you want to talk about some of the subgroup analysis? Yes. So we think at this point, the decision on whether tumor-informed or tumor naive is going to be more successful. I think it's pretty clear, right? If you just look at the volume and the physician interest in the marketplace. And a question about kind of tumor dynamics over time, that's not really relevant. I think generally, we're looking at coronal mutations that are present even if there's developments in the tumor over time. So I don't really think the way that it's being described is relevant. Look, we always keep our eye out on what's happening with competition, what's happening in the marketplace. And obviously, we've been successful doing innovative things and innovating and evolving products over time, and we'll continue to do that as the market evolves. But I think at this point, things are pretty clear, the tumor-informed approach is clearly the chosen approach by physician. Yes. I think we still feel very positive about ACOG guidelines, both for carrier screening and on 22q, and that's really grounded in looking at the data, looking at physician preferences and looking at the studies that have been done. So I think you will -- well, we expect to see something this year, and we feel very strongly that things are coming. Yes. Alex, do you want to take that? Yes, thanks. So I guess I'll say Garden's been out since, I think, 2021 promoting their tests, and we've seen them in accounts. We've seen them in the field. And they announced, I think, the COSMOS results maybe in January of this year. So that's been out there for a while. It's good that they've gotten the paper published. We don't think the dynamic really changes much. They've been out -- they've had the data out for 7 months now. So I don't think it will impact much. We feel really good about our test performance. 50 peer-reviewed publications plus multiple further studies in the pipeline. We're seeing 40% of oncologists use the product. Great operations. Things are going really well. Yes, I'll take that. So look, so first, we were happy to see Signatera and MRD testing being incorporated already as a footnote and NCCN based on the data that's out there. And we're excited about this 36-month perspective overall survival data that's going to be read out at ESMO, which we think is a very positive thing. The committee, I think, previously has said they're looking for overall survival data in a prospective manner. Of course, we're looking for randomized data as well, and that's what we're doing all of these randomized clinical trials. So we can't always predict what's going to happen with the NCCN committee. But certainly, doing all these studies, I think, puts us in a positive position. It's also important to remember, as Solomon described. I think, in his section, the different used cases of Signatera, right. So we have adjuvant decision-making, which is largely covered by the GALAXY study. We then have surveillance with the notion of doing surgery with curative intent if you find a recurrence. And that's -- those 2 things are really driving a lot of the utilization today. And then you have the Altera study, which is looking at sort of a new paradigm of treatment on molecular recurrence, but it's not necessarily the indication that's been driving all of the growth that we've seen today. So look, we'll have to see, but we're doing everything we can. We're putting ourselves in the right position by doing these studies to see guidelines and see impact over time. Yes. So we're actually seeing a lot of interest in these other areas. And one of the things I think that is great about the Signatera strategy is that we've been able to generate peer review data and get coverage in multiple different indications now. And in fact, in this last quarter, as Alex announced, we just had data on Merkel cell and now pancreatic cancer. So we're continuing to generate evidence in new tumor types, and those will all be submitted for MolDX. So when we've gotten coverage, we definitely see a bump as we go out and the sales team starts promoting in those indications. And then as we look towards 2025, actually, one of the exciting areas I think, is bladder cancer with the IMvigor011 results potentially being read out in 2025. So we continue to see a lot of interest across the board, and we think that the pan-cancer approach backed by strong clinical data is the right approach. Yes. So I think what we've said before is that we're definitely kind of looking at the competition, understanding what's happening, understand what physicians are interested in. We definitely think tumor informed is, I think, a winning approach at this point. But certainly, we are aware of what's happening in the marketplace and what types of test physicians are using. I think we've said we're innovating and we're doing different things, and we expect to announce some different MRD enhancements and product line extensions in the future. And I think we'll just have to wait and kind of see what those are. As far as early cancer detection, I think that's generally where we've talked about having that spend in the range of like $10 million to $15 million and having some readouts coming later this year, and those are actually on track. So we expect in the very near future to be able to give a readout on our progress in early cancer detection, which we're excited about. Yes, Catherine, good question. I'd say that's not the case on microdels. I think there -- the improvement is really going to come from a guideline change. I think what we're talking about is where there's a covered test and maybe the payers aren't paying when they're supposed to. And you need to really do things with the payer to try to make sure you get paid, like, for example, collecting medical records, appealing after an unjust denial, things like that. And we're just getting better at that as time goes on and we learn more. But certainly, the upside on something that generally doesn't have coverage like microdeletions still rests with guidelines and getting coverage in place. Yes. So we actually see, once doctors start using Signatera, they're generally pretty consistent. But obviously, there's groups across the board that have different ordering patterns. But I would say the typical pattern is they trial it out on a couple of patients. They like the experience, they see the clinical utility and then they start expanding into their practice, into other patients. Maybe other doctors within the practice start ordering the test. And then maybe they move beyond colorectal, would be around breast to other tumor types. And so I would say that once people get on board, generally, there's a very strong rate of recurrent orders and expansion within those practices. Now with that said, we definitely track new physicians coming on board, and we see a very healthy pipeline there of new physicians coming in with interest that maybe they were waiting for more data to come out, maybe they just -- they hadn't decided on the right timing for them to use it yet, but we're certainly seeing a lot of new people come in, in addition to expansion within the physicians that are currently using. Yes, that's a good question. So just as a reminder, what Altera is studying is sort of a new paradigm, which is treatment on molecular recurrence where you would need to go get approval for this particular drug to be used without clinical relapse. And so the vast, vast majority of the usage that we've seen today and the growth that we're seeing is based on different indications. And those indications are adjuvant decision-making, where the doctor is trying to make a decision about whether to give adjuvant chemotherapy or not. That's not being studied in Altera or just standard surveillance and recurrence monitoring for the intent of doing surgery because in colorectal cancer, in a significant portion of the patients, if you catch the cancer early, you can actually do surgery. And in many cases, the patients can be cured just from that surgery alone. So neither of those 2 indications are being studied in Altera. So the delay, obviously, won't have any impact on the current status quo. And I think we remain excited about reading the results out as we turn the corner into 2025 and potentially expanding the market opportunity further. Yes. I mean, look, we've thought about it as potentially opening up a new area of growth. This idea of sort of treatment on molecular recurrence. And I think that's really the view of how we're looking at things. And of course, the core volume growth today and all the utilization or the vast majority utilization that we're seeing. And we're still very, very underpenetrated, I think, are on adjuvant decision-making and recurrence monitoring with the intent to do surgery. So we'll have to see how things go after the data reads out and what additional uptake we get from this. Yes, that's a good question. And look, we're in a very underpenetrated market. There's lots of demand. We've been growing. We have seen two really strong quarters in a row, a very solid volume growth. But look, I think we have to just kind of stay conservative with our expectations as we normally are and try to outperform them, which we generally have been able to do. But look, it's hard to -- you can't judge things on a quarter-to-quarter basis because there's -- sometimes there's a different number of receiving days. Sometimes there's holidays. Sometimes there's big major conferences where doctors are at. And so I think part of the point of just sort of reiterating kind of the base case is just because things can fluctuate every quarter. But when you take a step back, you look at an annual basis, I think that's kind of probably a better way to look at things. But of course, we've given the same pitch before about the 8,000 to 9,000. I think we reiterated that in Q1, and then we delivered 13,000 units of growth. So it's just a kind of a standard baseline that we keep reiterating and has nothing to do with sort of our views on exactly how the next particular quarter is going. Yes, I would say, look, when you look back to when we signed the partnership back in 2019, I mean, things have really changed quite a bit since then, right. So Signatera growth has accelerated and grown immensely. And we're just in a very different place than we were back when we sell that partnership. And as a reminder, we were running the plasma test, but the partner laboratory was responsible for commercial distribution. And that can be a challenging situation to be in. And I think for business reasons, both sides decided that it didn't make sense to continue. But like I said, it doesn't impact our forecast. We're focusing on Signatera, the opportunity that we have with Altera, which I think we're doing really well on. We continue to do really well in immunotherapy monitoring where we've had very strong data where a lot of times, we see the Altera being ordered alongside those immunotherapy monitoring patients. So we're continuing to move forward in that indication, but it just doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to continue the partnership. It's sort of -- yes, we'll move it along."

Let's get into the highlights on the next slide. We had an excellent quarter across the board, and I'm very pleased to share that we met a major milestone in the life cycle of the company and reaching cash flow breakeven in Q1, significantly ahead of schedule. Revenues were up 18% sequentially versus Q4 of 2023 and up 52% compared to Q1 of last year driven by record volume growth and improving ASPs. Volumes were up over 17% sequentially versus Q4 of 2023, which is the fastest sequential growth rate we've seen since 2021, when the volumes were less than half the size they are now.\n We had record volumes across oncology, organ health and women's health. In oncology, we performed 115,000 units in the quarter, representing sequential growth of 17,000 units versus Q4 of last year, a record growth quarter for the company. Women's Health was also particularly strong, up more than 85,000 units versus Q4 of last year. Improving ASPs and continued execution on cost reduction drove a record gross margin of 57% compared to 39% gross margin in Q1 of 2023. All of this momentum puts us in a great position to significantly raise every aspect of the guide for the rest of the year.\n We are now expecting revenues of $1.42 billion to $1.45 billion, which is $100 million above the midpoint of the range we provided in February. We are also raising gross margins from 50% to 53% to a new range of 53% to 55%. And importantly, even as we increase investments in commercial operations and R&D, we are significantly reducing our cash burn guide for the year. Our previous range included a burn of $75 million to $50 million, and we are now projecting to be cash flow breakeven for the full year, plus or minus $25 million.\n We've also had a full slate of clinical and product announcements, including the launch of our fetal RhD test. The vast majority of the NIPT labs do not offer this type of testing and we are particularly pleased to be serving a critical unmet need given the shortage of RhIG treatments available right now in the United States. In Oregon Health, many of you saw the updated KDIGO guidelines that support genetic testing in patients with chronic kidney disease. This was great to see, particularly after the release of the excellent prospective results we read out last year with the RenaCARE study. More recently, we were thrilled to see the publication of our ProActive study in a top journal, which represents the largest perspective donor-derived cell-free DNA study published to date in the kidney transplant space. We think we have strong momentum in organ health and we're excited about driving this forward this year.\n In oncology, we are very encouraged by the analysis released in the randomized prospective Phase III IMvigor011 trial in bladder cancer in which patients that remain negative on serial Signatera testing had excellent outcomes. This is meaningful as it suggests that these MRD-negative patients may be able to forego treatment in favor of Signatera surveillance. This is also being explicitly evaluated in the modern trial which we discussed last quarter. We also had several additional data readouts that we will cover today. We've got a full agenda for the call, and I'm excited to get into the business trends on the next slide.\n The first slide shows our sequential growth in volume between Q4 and Q1, both this year and last year. We had a very strong Q1 for women's health. We saw a nice lift from the Invitae accounts we picked up in January and February, and the transition has been a success, and we're pleased with the results. We also had success organically growing the business. In fact, the majority of our growth in Q1 came from organic new account wins and growth within our existing women's health accounts. Our core advantages continue to shine in the field, and we've got a lot of traction with the launch of our RhD product, which we'll discuss later on the call.\n Organ Health was also a bright spot this quarter. We saw strong sequential growth in Prospera on the back of the ProActive publication and Renasight grew nicely as well, which is promising given that the updated KDIGO guidelines came out very late in the quarter. And in oncology, we delivered our best quarter ever for Signatera unit growth.\n Double-clicking on oncology volumes on the next slide. We typically see our oncology units grow between 7,000 and 10,000 units quarter-over-quarter. In Q1 oncology grew 17,000 units overall, with most of these units coming from the core Signatera clinical business. We are seeing significant gains and new physicians and new patient starts in addition to recurrence monitoring. We think customers came out of ASCO GI excited about the galaxy data in CRC and that helped the quarter, along with the quality, the size and the breadth of our clinical trial data, which is resonating with physicians. We're off to another strong start in Q2. But with that said, we have, of course, see fluctuations in sequential growth as we've seen in the past.\n The next slide shows the significant step-up in revenues we've seen over time, similar to the volume story. We had 18% sequential revenue growth over Q4 of last year and 52% compared to Q1 of last year. This represents some of the fastest revenue growth metrics we generated despite the fact that the revenue base has more than doubled in the last 3 years. In addition to the volume growth, we continue to see ASPs significantly outperforming across all of our major products. Women's health and organ health ASPs were up and Signatera ASPs were above $1,000 in Q1.\n We continue to make progress on Signatera reimbursement, and we think we have a line of sight to continue ASP expansion through the rest of the year. In addition, the rapid improvement in ASP has driven about $34 million in revenue true-ups this quarter. I think that's a very healthy sign for the business as it indicates that cash collections are exceeding our prior estimates. Our growth trends remained strong even when stripping out the true-ups and those don't happen every quarter.\n On the next slide, you can really see the impact of our improving ASP and COGS on gross margin over the last year. Obviously, 57% is a huge number. But even if you strip out the revenue true-ups, we estimate the underlying repeatable gross margin would have been roughly 53%, which is well ahead of our expectations and drives the increase in the guide. We put a ton of resources and management focus on improving ASPs, but I'm equally excited about the COGS execution we generated recently. We have had several internal projects launched, including moving to higher throughput sequencers in both Austin and San Carlos for our prenatal business. \n In addition, we are still expanding our exome capabilities, which will likely drive some short-term increased cost in Signatera COGS, but we are already below our goal of $450 based on the scaling benefits that we expect to stay there for the rest of the year. We are also now getting large rebates from vendors as we hit higher volume tiers in our contracts. We've historically poured a meaningful percentage of our R&D spend into cost reductions and now those lead costs are really paying dividends.\n So all these trends sum to the results on the next slide, which shows our cash burn reduction over time. We set a cash flow breakeven target on the Q1 earnings call about 2 years ago, and we're pleased to have met this goal significantly ahead of schedule. We've been very consistent about the strategy to get here. We've ramped volumes and revenues, increased ASPs and lowered COGS, leading to increased gross margins, and we've done that while maintaining ambitious levels of investment in R&D and commercial activities. We think this formula will allow us to continue delivering excellent financial results while maintaining our leadership position in clinical data generation, new product launches and patient experience.\n In addition, we've achieved this cash flow breakeven goal without the help of any upcoming potential catalysts such as 22q guidelines or NCCN guidelines. Those would still represent further upside along with continuing to execute the core strategy in very large underpenetrated markets. Going through the rest of the year, we may bounce around between positive and negative cash flow quarters depending on the working capital variables, like the timing of insurance payments, timing of CapEx and the lab and other factors. But fundamentally, we think we're in a position to continue to serve more patients and grow the business and drive innovation without continually burning cash.\n And with that said, let me turn it over to Solomon. Solomon? \nSolomon Moshkevich: Thanks, Steve. On to some of the highlights from our clinical and product road map. In April, we were pleased to mark that we surpassed over 200 peer-reviewed papers as a company. This chart highlights that we have pursued the strategy throughout the history of the company across all key areas of focus with more than 85 papers in women's health, more than 75 in oncology and MRD, and more than 40 in organ health. We've also been published in some of the most highly respected journals in the world, including science, nature and nature medicine. These papers include major breakthroughs in patient care, such as the SMART trial with Panorama, the GALAXY study with Signatera in the proactive trial with Prospera, the latter which was the paper that brought us to the 200 mark. We look forward to growing this even further as we continue generating meaningful evidence to support our road map and our mission.\n In women's health, as Steve mentioned, the launch of our new fetal RhD test was a major advancement in prenatal care and one that really differentiates Natera. The test can be performed alongside Panorama as early as 9 weeks gestation and is designed to determine the fetal Rh status from a maternal blood draw. The launch is particularly timely right now as OB/GYNs are currently facing limited supplies of medication that are traditionally given to RhD negative women to prevent potential complications during pregnancy. The FDA warned about the shortage earlier this year. And following suit, ACOG came out with a statement just in April that supports the use of NIPT for fetal RhD testing essentially to help conserve medication supply. We are proud to offer this test at a time of critical need in the prenatal community.\n Beyond the shortage, we view this launch as a key differentiator for Natera on several fronts. First, the vast majority of other NIPT labs do not offer fetal RhD assessment with only one other test on the market in the U.S. Second, Natera's test is backed by a large validation study that included fetal RhD status confirmed via newborn serology, which is the gold standard, in more than 650 RhD negative pregnancies. This is roughly 10x more patients with confirmed outcomes than validation studies from other labs. The performance was also outstanding, resulting in 100% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. We believe these differentiators, coupled with the highly validated SNP-based technology that's already built into Panorama will allow us to expand our reach into new physician practices.\n Moving to organ health. We had some key announcements during the quarter for both Renasight and Prospera. Starting with Renasight, our genetic test for chronic kidney disease. We are pleased to see a recent guideline update from a leading medical society in nephrology. KDIGO, which stands for kidney disease improving global outcomes. KDIGO updated their clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. This is significant as the guideline had not been updated in more than 10 years. \n The guideline now includes a specific section about the use of genetic testing in CKD and offers a broad range of support, including, number one, stating that genetic tests should be used, among other factors, to establish the cause of CKD; number two, noting that genetic testing can impact the clinical management of CKD patients just as we saw in the RenaCARE study; and number three, recommending a list of clinical indications where genetic testing is particularly informative. And that's the list, which represents the vast majority of CKD patients.\n The updated guideline makes it clear that genetic tests like Renasight are an essential tool for a nephrologist in the management of CKD patients. We believe this was a key milestone for the field of renal genetics, and we expect this guideline to have a positive impact on clinical adoption of Renasight testing. In April, we also published the first major readout from the ProActive trial, which was the largest prospective donor-derived cfDNA study in kidney transplantation with data from the first 1,600 patients approximately. \n The data demonstrated for the first time that Prospera is a leading indicator of rejection as donor cell-free DNA levels were significantly elevated up to 5 months prior to antibody-mediated rejection and up to 2 months prior to T cell-mediated rejection. These results show the value of using Prospera as an ongoing surveillance tool to detect rejections earlier, not just in scenarios that are for cause. Further, the ProActive data once again highlights the outstanding performance of Prospera with an area under the curve of 0.88 and a negative predictive value of 98% in line with performance as published in the previous studies. \n In a pretty short time, Prospera has established itself as the premier choice in transplant monitoring. And based on this strong clinical evidence, we see growing momentum behind Prospera among transplant physicians in the market. Finally, in oncology, on top of the record volume growth that we generated during the quarter, as Steve outlined. We had a steady drumbeat of trial announcements and publications that continue to demonstrate the clinical value of Signatera across tumor types.\n I'm going to hand it over to Alex to provide color on our progress in colorectal, bladder, breast and uterine cancers, starting with an update on the ALTAIR trial where things are on track. Alex? \nAlexey Aleshin: Thank you, Solomon. I'll start with colorectal cancer, in particular, the ALTAIR study, where we have an exciting few months in store. As a reminder, ALTAIR is a treatment on molecular recurrence randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study in colorectal cancer that is part of the ongoing CIRCULATE-Japan study. We've been working closely with our partners in Japan and are looking forward to approaching the key milestones you see outlined on the slide here. First and foremost, we recently surpassed the prespecified target of 190 events for the trial, which is a key step in getting to the next phase of statistical analyses for the readout.\n After completion of data analysis by our collaborators in Japan, we plan to announce top line results in August. We expect to present the complete analysis including primary and secondary endpoints at a major conference in the fall. And by the end of the year, we plan to submit the study for peer-reviewed publication. We're very excited to share these results with you as we do believe that this study, if positive, may be one of the most impactful readouts in early-stage CRC in quite some time.\n Also in colorectal cancer, we recently announced in March our participation in the CIRCULATE-France trial which is another randomized Phase III study. We were pleased that Signatera was selected based on the well-validated asset performance characteristics for patient enrollment into this study, which is the only ongoing randomized trial dedicated to studying the benefit of ctDNA testing in low-risk stage II colorectal cancer. It complements our data generation in both CIRCULATE-Japan and North America trials which are also studying MRD guided treatment in colorectal cancer, but in a higher risk population.\n CIRCULATE-France specifically addresses the need for a personalized approach in a population who currently does not receive chemotherapy as the standard of care and with over 44,000 people in France diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. We believe this trial has the potential to improve outcomes for many of these patients and pave the way to adoption and reimbursement of Signatera in France and possibly the European Union. We also had compelling data released in bladder cancer from the ongoing IMvigor011 trial, which is an international randomized Phase III trial being conducted in collaboration with Genentech.\n This is the first time that prospective Signatera data from an ongoing Phase III global study was presented, a milestone for our evidence generation strategy. The first analysis was presented in March at the European Association of Urology Conference and included post surgical outcomes of 171 patients with high-risk bladder cancer, which serially tested negative with Signatera. The analysis showed that patients will remain Signatera-negative without treatment at disease-free survival rates of 92% at 12 months and 88% at 18 months. Furthermore, the overall survival rates were 100% at 12 months and 98% at 18 months. This was a significant improvement versus the baseline expectations set by prior biobank studies, which further underscores the importance of prospective evidence generation.\n These results have been generating interest in the medical community and give us increasing confidence that patients were Signatera-negative after surgery and remain negative under surveillance, might be able to be spared from adjuvant therapy which is the current standard of care for high-risk patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. This concept is being formally evaluated in the randomized NCI-sponsored MODERN study, which we discussed in detail during the last earnings call.\n While this first analysis covered only MRD-negative patients, the MRD-positive arm of the trial, which is investigating the efficacy of Genentech's atezolizumab, drug versus placebo is expected to read out early next year. That trial result is expected to serve as the basis of our first FDA submission for Signatera for companion diagnostic label in bladder cancer. We are optimistic on what this data could mean for the role of Signatera in clinical practice as well as the potential to tailor treatment and improve outcomes for the more than 150,000 muscle invasive bladder cancer cases diagnosed globally each year.\n Moving to the next slide. Here, you can see meaningful data we've generated in common cancers affecting women. Earlier this year, we had a new publication in Gynecologic Oncology, validating the use of Signatera in resected uterine cancer. This is especially timely and important as new diagnoses are rising in the U.S. and mortality rights are also increasing, which is at least partially due to an increase in diagnosis of the more aggressive subtypes of this disease. \n In this study of real-world Signatera utilization, we looked at 267 plasma samples drawn after surgery from 101 women with uterine cancer. As you can see from the Kaplan-Meier curve on the left, the results demonstrate how Signatera is a powerful postsurgical predictor of recurrence. All patients who were Signatera negative after surgery remain recurrence free. All Signatera-positive patients had a 15-fold worse recurrence-free survival. \n Moving to breast cancer. We announced the publication of an expanded cohort from the EBLIS study. The original cohort of 49 patients was published in 2019 with up to 5 years of clinical follow-up. The new expanded cohort had Signatera monitoring in 156 patients across all subtypes of breast cancer with over 1,000 plasma time points being analyzed. It also had clinical follow-up of up to 12 years, which we believe is the longest in the field of ctDNA monitoring. Samples in the study were collected every 6 months starting after the completion of definitive therapy.\n Patients who were Signatera-positive had over a 53 fold increased risk of death compared to those who test a persistently negative on Signatera. The diagnostic lead times were also longer than before with Signatera detection of recurrence up to 3 years before imaging being observed with median lead time of 10.5 months. Altogether, these findings bolster the evidence for long-term monitoring of breast cancer patients who often face late recurrences. These publications build on our commitment to be a leader in women's health. This includes our recent MolDX approval in ovarian cancer as well as our expansion of breast cancer coverage to the neoadjuvant setting.\n Lastly, we continue to make progress on our early cancer detection program with judicious utilization of resources and a data-first strategy. We are completing a large case control study, and we plan for the data to be announced in June. In addition, as we stated before, we are prospectively collecting a large screening cohort of colonoscopy matched blood samples, and we plan to share the results of that study in Q4.\n With that update, let me hand the call back to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? \nMike Brophy: Great. Thanks, Alex. The next slide is just a summary of the P&L in Q1 and the year-over-year progress we've made. Steve covered the key points on revenues and margins, so I won't repeat them here. On the expense lines we've made several growth-oriented investments in SG&A over the past year. For example, picking up the women's health sales team from [ Invitae ] and doubling down on our staffing and technology investments and revenue cycle that we've described previously. We also had some elevated litigation expenses in the quarter given all the activity we had on the IP front in Q1.\n We stepped up R&D modestly in part with the goal of accelerating several product launches in the near future. The first of which is the time-sensitive Rh launch Steven, Solomon described earlier. I think each of these investments are delivering strong ROICs as evidenced by the significant bottom line improvement year-on-year in EBITDA, EPS and of course, cash burn where we burned $86 million in Q1 last year and broke even in Q1 this year.\n I was particularly pleased to see us breakeven on cash flow this quarter given the disruption to the entire health care payments that's been caused by the Change Healthcare Cyberattack. Change is not a direct vendor to us, but the attack nonetheless cost several weeks of confusion and delayed claims submissions as changes of very large claims and payments clear in-house. So I still think the impact is ultimately immaterial to our results. We are still dealing with backlog responses from payers and I think the cleanup will last well into Q3 at least. The good news is that our team is able to move quickly, find some alternative pathways to get claims submitted and responded and our overall positive momentum on volumes and ASPs allowed us to deliver above plan. \n Okay. Good. Let's get to the revised financial guidance on the next slide. On revenues, we are now expecting $1.42 billion to $1.45 billion for the full year 2024. This represents a bump of about $100 million at the midpoint as compared to the roughly $20 million beat in the quarter when we're moving the revenue true-up Steve talked about. The annual revenue guide now implies about 33% revenue growth versus 2023. We experienced a huge organic step-up in women's health, as you saw in the earlier slides which was further amplified by the Invitae addition in Q1. As a reminder, there's a pronounced seasonality in our women's health volumes. So we wouldn't be surprised to see some modest pullback in Q2 volumes as we've seen in previous years then see sequential growth in the women's health business again in Q3 and Q4.\n We are off to a strong start again in oncology volumes in Q2, though I wouldn't expect the same kind of step-up we saw in Q1. We've got great momentum going in Signatera and expect continued sequential growth in Q2 and beyond this year. The guide implies ASPs remaining stable at these levels across women's health and oncology for the rest of the year. We think that's appropriate because there can always be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in ASPs, but if we can continue to drive them higher, as Steve described, that would be a source of upside to the guidance. So the revenue guide implies that we will build on the strong volume base we've established in Q1 and continue to benefit from the ASPs we are seeing now at this level.\n As Steve mentioned in his section, we are already ahead of schedule for our COGS forecast, and so the guide implies stable COGS for the remainder of the year. We've got a number of products and lab workflow launches planned for this year, which usually generates some temporary transition costs, but I think those can be balanced out by the efficiencies we've already achieved in Q1. So those are the assumptions driving the increase in our gross margin expectations for the year.\n The operating expense guide implies that quarterly expenses will remain relatively flat compared to Q1 for the rest of the year. This should allow for room to make incremental growth investments in sales and operations and R&D as a chunk of the Q1 SG&A spend went to all the IP-related litigation activities and a onetime noncash true-up related to stock-based comp. While we will continue to defend our IT, I don't expect that level of legal activity to repeat every quarter. As Steve described, we are in position to keep making investments to stay in the lead and still grow revenues much faster than expenses. You can see the result of that formula on the cash burn guide, which now has us cash neutral at the midpoint of the range. \n Now that we are operating at this breakeven level, it's important to understand that we will expect to have fluctuations in quarterly cash burn due to timing of capital expenditures and working capital, as Steve described. The timing of reimbursement from payers can easily vary in a given quarter and the changed health care breach is a good example of how that can happen. So I fully expect to have a quarter where we have negative cash flow and others where we are positive and the guide just represents the full year results. The income statement, of course, is less prone to these swings. And so I expect our losses to gradually narrow through the course of the year.\n Okay. The next slide we'll do quickly. I was looking back at the Q1 2022 earnings call's deck while preparing for our call today. And I thought this long-range model from that presentation was an interesting slide. This is the exact slide we used when setting the goal of getting to a cash flow breakeven quarter in '24. And you can see that our results this quarter mirror very closely what we had forecasted back then. Specifically, we thought we could get to roughly $1.4 billion in annual revenues at mid-50s gross margins on stable operating expenses in 2024, which is essentially what we're showing today. I think most investors discounted this target at the time as being overly aggressive, but we have a lot of conviction in this model because starting with Steve, our executive team spends a lot of time and effort forecasting the business.\n One final slide on the next slide, just to summarize a few of the potential key catalysts to watch more for the remainder of the year. Of course, we will remain focused on driving quarterly results and hope to have more earnings calls like this one. As of today, we've been able to deliver strong results without the tailwind of updated women's health guidelines in carrier screening or micro deletions. As usual, we don't include any guideline expectations in our guidance because the timing of these updates are completely out of our hands and hard to predict. Still, we continue to expect updating guidelines in both [ micro dels ] and broad panel carrier screening and wouldn't be rise to see one or both of them arrive in the near term.\n The ALTAIR study continues to progress on schedule. And while the time line is ultimately in the hands of the investigators, we continue to expect top line results to be released in August, subject to variances caused by investigator data analysis and the embargo requirements of various academic conferences where the data may be presented? We've got a number of additional cancer types in the pipeline for MolDX coverage, and we hope to be able to announce several additional coverage decisions this year. We also have submitted an LCD for Renasight and hope to report on further progress on that later this year.\n We spent a good amount of time on biomarker estates during our Q4 call, so we didn't want to rehash that content again today. But we are pleased with the early traction we are seeing. We continue to think that while the positive impact is most likely to be seen in 2025, progress through the course of this year on biomarker-related reimbursement would further enhance our results. Finally, we are pleased to be able to announce our first major product launch of the year with [ RSV ] testing, and we've got several more slates to launch later this year and look forward to announcing those as they go live.\n Okay. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. It looks like our first question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. \nDaniel Brennan: Maybe just the first one on Signatera kind of volume and price. Steve, I think you talked about the GALAXY impact. I would love to hear you elaborate a little bit on that in terms of new docs, existing docs and what you're seeing in Q2 from that? And then on the pricing side, Mike, I think you heard -- I heard maybe flat pricing from here on Signatera, sequentially, just wondering why it couldn't keep ticking up throughout the year? \nSteve Chapman: Yes, it's a great question. So when you look at growing, I mean, really with any clinical diagnostic, you want to add new physicians, new accounts and then within the accounts you want to grow the business to increase utilization with the existing physicians. And so with that exactly what we're seeing is once doctors start using Signatera. They tend to increase their utilization and continue using it. And then once one doctor starts within a practice, it tends to sort of spread within the practice. So obviously, ASCO GI, we had some great additional data coming out of the GALAXY study. We think that was received very well, and we're seeing that lead to increased growth.\n Mike, do you want to talk about ASPs? \nMike Brophy: Yes. No, thanks for the question. So Signatera ASPs are above $1,000 in the quarter. As I look at the more recent fundamentals on Signatera ASPs, I mean, I think there is scope for the ASPs to continue to increase through the course of the year. Specifically, I'm just looking at payment rates and trends from Medicare Advantage payers as they continue to come online and some of the early green shoots from the biomarker states that we're talking about in the prepared remarks. And really, these accruals quarter-to-quarter really come down like a judgment call, like how much history do you want to see before you step up the accrued ASP again? And it may turn out, we were a bit cautious on this accrual, but I just want to see some more history there.\n So I feel pretty good about our ability to grow ASPs for the remainder of the year. So that maybe begs the question on the guide, why hold ASPs steady at these levels? And it really goes back to that kind of precaution. I just want to see enough history with new payers coming online to see that stable trend within a given payer before starting to accrue. But the underlying fundamentals look great for the Signatera ASPs, I think. \nDaniel Brennan: Great. And then maybe I just want to follow up on gross margins, really strong. Even ex the true-up still beat us by over 300 basis points. So I think you discussed COGS reductions, ASP and then also cash collections beyond the true-up. So just did I hear you guys right, you're thinking gross margins flat from here. I'm just wondering some of the benefits you had in the quarter, like I would assume there's possibly further tailwind from those. So maybe just speak a little bit what really drove the beat on gross margins and how we think about that going forward? \nMike Brophy: Yes. I mean on gross margins, I mean, just to clarify, I mean I think the guide now is 53% to 55% and organic implied like 53%. So the midpoint to guide now implies sequential improvement through the rest of the year, so it's like your total year would end up higher, although 53% in the guide. The reasons for that, again, I mean, there's some caution that's warranted as it relates to forecasting gross margins in this business quarter-to-quarter just because the ASPs can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, right?\n We also don't -- in the guide, we just presume that there's no true-ups kind of in the guide. And of course, if you had true-ups through the course of the year, that would tend to be upside to the guidance. So what that guide is intended to do is to express confidence and our ability to modestly improve the gross margins through the rest of the year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant. \nTejas Savant: Maybe just a math question for you, Mike. You beat by $50 million, including about $34 million and true-ups, but you're raising your guide by a $100 million, right? So as we try to build that bridge in terms of incremental upside. Can you just help us parse it out between Signatera? You've got the Renasight, KDIGO update and any incremental Invitae upside as well versus the $20 million to $25 million that you had baked in earlier? \nMike Brophy: Yes. Yes. So ASPs across the board were holding relatively stable in the guide through the rest of the year, there's some modest improvements in the guide in women's health that we feel quite good about. But overall, it's really stable in the guide for ASPs. So that leaves volumes for you as the major source of upside kind of across the products which we think makes a turnaround sense just given that we've seen this big step-up in Q1, and now we feel like we're in a position to grow from this base understanding that there is some seasonality to be seen in some of these businesses, particularly in women's health. \n What we've seen historically is that you have a big Q1 and then you're kind of sequentially down a bit in Q2 and then you grow the remainder of the year, just like we talked about in the prepared remarks. And then in Signatera and Prospera where, frankly, we're just expecting continued sequential quarterly volume growth in each of those businesses, probably not at the level that we saw in Q1, just to be cautious about that. I mean that was a massive outperformance on Signatera volumes although we are off to a good start so far in Q2. So that's some kind of flavor on where the raise is coming from. It's primarily volume based. And it's really sorry for the boring answer, but its kind of volume from across the board is really contributing to that. \nTejas Savant: Got it. And a 2-parter for my follow-up here. So starting with Renasight, following KDIGO, have you had any sort of discussions with the National Kidney Foundation. Is that something that we could see in the summer year? And can you share some data on just how the conversations have gone since KDIGO went into effect? Are you starting to see that nephrologist penetration go up from the 50% who use the test? And are you starting to see repeat use come through as well?\n And then, Steve, one for you on just screening, right? We've had some competitor readouts here. We've got an FDA AdCom coming up as well. So I'm just curious as to whether you still think that better performance versus those tests that have read out in blood is good enough? Or has the goalposts shifted in your mind a little bit and you expect sort of step function better performance particularly in advanced adenoma as the threshold for Natera to go after that indication. \nSteve Chapman: Yes. That's a great question. So I'll comment briefly on KDIGO and Renasight and then Solomon if there's something you want to add. So certainly, we've been having a lot of conversations with physicians about the guideline and those -- it's being very well received. I mean, there's a lot of excitement about the updated guideline. So I think there is a lot of opportunity here to more deeply penetrate this market, which there's, I think, maybe 40 million Americans or something in that range that are sitting with the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. So there's a big opportunity here.\n Really, I think the goal is not necessarily to go get more and more physicians ordering the test. It's to increase the utilization within the accounts, and that's what we're working on now. We do think that the NKF will be coming out with an updated guideline at some point in the future. We hope that comes this year. We don't know exactly what it's going to say. But I think they're obviously working closely with KDIGO and looking at all the new data coming out. So that's exciting.\n And on [ ECD ], I think, obviously, we've got a readout coming pretty soon. So I'll probably just defer comments there until I think we said in June when the case-controlled study reads out. \nSolomon Moshkevich: I think you hit all the key points, nothing to add there. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. \nPuneet Souda: I guess the first question is the contribution that you saw from Invitae accounts, how is sort of that likely to fall through the rest of the year? I mean it appears that you had a bolus. There are some organic account wins in the quarter. Could you talk about deepening of those accounts and further account wins that you haven't had so far may be falling into 2Q. And also, some of these accounts were maybe patient pay or no pay account. So talk to us a little bit about sort of cleanup of those accounts and how sustainable is the ASP trend going forward? \nSteve Chapman: Yes, it's a good question. So I think when Invitae, last announced the numbers, I think, which is maybe in September 2023, things changed quite a bit between that time frame and when we took over at the end of January. And I think they had gotten -- really gotten rid of a lot of that cash pay business in that lower margin business. So when we came in the January generally it was sort of the higher-margin business, except for some of the international where we got what we could, but some of the lower-margin business there, just we weren't able to participate it. \n But most of the business came is on now that we're going to get. And I think a tiny amount in January, a little more ramping up in February. And then I think March was almost a complete month there, but we did really well. So you'll get the kind of full pacing of that quarter of the Invitae volume in Q2. But we did really well based on where we started in January, we got the majority of the business converted over, and we're feeling good about that. But again, there was a pretty significant step down from where we started in January to where they last reported. \n With that said, also you asked about organic growth. The majority of the Q1 volume growth in Women's Health, which was incredible, the 85,000 units I think that is one of the fastest-growing sequential quarters we've ever had in the history of the company. I've mentioned before that we were seeing record units per receiving day in December. There's just a lot of momentum with, I think the differentiators that we have at Natera, I think the data that we've put out, we're starting -- continuing to see, I think, a significant interest from physicians, and that's driving a lot of the organic growth. \nPuneet Souda: Got it. Super. And then on the oncology side, if I may ask, if Salmon or Alex could cover this, could you just update the latest thoughts on sort of the timing of NCCN and sort of what is required there, and how essential is the success of ALTAIR to that? \nSteve Chapman: Yes. Solomon, do you want to make a couple of comments and then maybe Alex, you can jump in. \nSolomon Moshkevich: Sure. Good question, Puneet. I think no change to our discussion back in San Diego at the conference where we expect that the CRC committee for the NCCN meets regularly once a year, usually in that late summer time frame. And we think that given the timing of the readout that we just described on the call. There's a pretty good chance that they incorporate some of the data that's reported from ALTAIR and we're optimistic that we see something early next year based on the regular timing. We do think the ALTAIR readout is pretty critical for that. But as a reminder, we're seeing really strong adoption and trends in the marketplace based on the existing evidence that we have.\n So Natera being able to achieve its goals in oncology, kind of happen independent of that, but it certainly provides a significant catalyst. And that, together with the expected readout in muscle invasive bladder cancer from the IMvigor011 trial, which should independently, assuming that's a positive readout, which remains to be seen and that would lead to a separate NCCN committee review as well. \nAlexey Aleshin: Great Solomon. Few words to add to that, yes. So we did surpass the 190 events. So now the data is really being analyzed. So in August, the results will come out at a top line level. I think there's been a lot of questions about what good looks like? And I think we've previously guided to the MOSAIC study. Obviously, we do not control the guidelines, but we do control generating the data, right, to provide the evidence for those guidelines to hopefully be updated. \n So I think in terms of the guidelines timing, I think let's see what the results look like. And I think at that point, we can kind of provide some more guidance. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. \nDouglas Schenkel: As a rule, in all these years, I don't think I've ever congratulated anyone on a quarterly performance, but I will at least say I can tell you, given how the market has been recently, we all appreciate a nice, clean and robust beat. So with that said, let me start with some model questions. On guidance, first, I don't think you're assuming improvement in Signatera ASPs even though coverage expanded at the beginning of the year. Is that just conservatism? And I'm sorry if I missed it, but what is now in guidance for Invitae contributions? \nSteve Chapman: Mike, do you want to take that? \nMike Brophy: Yes. So on the ASPs, the operative one is stable. So I don't expect extremely meaningful ASP bonds to the guidance, this is not dependent on massive outperformance versus Q1 ASPs, and we've got some modest ASP improvement for Signatera in the back half of the year. I think that's pretty achievable and that would contemplate some contribution from the expanded coverage we saw early in the year. But again, I think there is -- if we can do the things that we're trying to do internally, I think that's a potential source of upside versus the guide today, which I think that's the appropriate way to do it.\n In terms of the Invitae contribution, we had initially with only the benefit of a few weeks operating in those accounts. I mean we had initially carved out something like $20 million that we had in revenues this year that we attributed to the Invitae accounts. We think we're modestly exceeding that now. Although I would highlight that as Steve mentioned this in his prepared remarks around that we really had a very meaningful step-up in the women's health volume sequentially over Q4, which was really quite ratifying to us. \n And when we peel back the onion on that, I mean, the vast majority of that is coming from organic sources, which I think kind of speaks to the strength of the franchise and our ability to just kind of continue to grow the market and win share. And the Invitae added accounts are really just their additional momentum on top of that. But I think fundamentally, this is a strong underlying performance. So it's above, I think the Invitae is above expectations and that's incorporated in the size of the raise. \nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. And I'll try to be quick with the follow-ups. First, as a rule, how long would you expect it to take going from guideline expansion to actually seeing ASP increases on the women's health side. And then the other one I just wanted to touch on as a cleanup because we're getting this question increasingly as new investors look at the name. What percentage of Signatera assays today are for true surveillance versus point in time MRD? \nSteve Chapman: Yes. I'll comment on the first question. So one of the things that's really exciting about Natera right now is we're growing rapidly. We're hitting this cash flow of breakeven milestone and we're increasing our investment in the future of the business in both innovation and in the commercial franchise. So it's great to be doing all of those things at one time and seeing the company's strategy working. But at the same time, we're not really forecasting in the impact of these big potential catalysts that could come in the future. \n For example, as you mentioned, the 22q guidelines. And these could be very significant meaningful events in the future if they do come through and they're positive. The guidelines can impact payer coverage policies very quickly like was in a period of sort of 3 to 6 months if the guidelines are very definitive. If the guidelines are a little more vague, it can take longer potentially if it does have an impact at all. And so it really depends on what the guideline says. And we're just going to have to wait and see.\n On the second question, I think Mike that was a question for you. Yes, go ahead. \nMike Brophy: Yes. So the question was on kind of the mix in Signatera volumes between adjuvant and surveillance. And what we've seen is that there's a slight majority of the volumes that are still adjuvant volumes, and that's been pretty stable now for several quarters. Initially in the launch, of course, all of the units are adjuvant treatment units, because patients almost always start with us in Signatera in the adjuvant setting. And then as those patients go into remission, we're seeing very high compliance with patients staying with Signatera into the surveillance setting, which we find very encouraging. It's kind of consistent with kind of qualitatively, we think we heard about patients understanding of the utility of the test.\n So absent other factors, you would expect steady state to have the vast majority of your volumes to be recurrence monitoring volumes. And we haven't quite seen that. We've seen some of that trend progression, but we've been holding steady work and it's still a little bit of the majority is in the adjuvant setting. And what's causing that is just the rapid new patient starts that we continue to see. So you think about kind of the top of the funnel just continues to grow really rapidly.\n So I actually think that penalizes your margins in the immediate term, but I think that's a great sign for the order progression of the product here in the future. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. \nCatherine Ramsey: First, Mike, maybe on that slide from 1Q '22 earnings that you showed. Do you still feel comfortable with this 70% plus gross margin and 25% plus EBIT margin target when you get to over $2 billion of revenue? \nMike Brophy: I knew that someone was going to come and ask me about like what about the long term? So yes, no, thanks for the question, Catherine. Yes, I mean, look, I mean, obviously, with the revenue trajectory that we've been on, $2 billion plus, I think if you're talking about long-term steady state. I mean I think that looks pretty safe. At this point, I think we're going to be able to get beyond that. 70% and 25% EBIT margins, I think, are achievable. I mean, if you think you're willing to go out a few years and this is not kind of time dated guidance as the cash flow breakeven target was, but this is more kind of conceptual what can the business do based on the forecasted unit economics.\n And I think the path to getting to those types of margins are going to require continued maturation in the Signatera ASP, continued excellent prospective data, which we want to publish, and is obviously slated to come down the pipeline, we'll support that. I think there's still room to move the women's health margins meaningfully, particularly if you can get some benefit from guideline inclusion that we haven't yet seen, as we talked about in the prepared remarks.\n On the EBIT margin, it's really a function of those couple of variables I just described, plus this concept that we don't need to grow expenses anywhere near as rapidly as we're seeing the revenue growth happening. So an increasing percentage of every incremental revenue dollar from here drops more to the bottom line, right? And so I do think that given -- if you can get to 70% gross margins, at this scale well beyond $2 billion, I do think that 25% EBIT margins are still in play for us. So really encouraged by the trajectory in the business, obviously. \nCatherine Ramsey: All right. Great. And then on the Signatera volume outperformance in the quarter, are there any particular indications that are driving that strength? Or is it pretty broad-based? \nSteve Chapman: Yes. Solomon, do you want to talk about that? \nSolomon Moshkevich: Yes. Great. First of all, it was really broad-based. I mean, we're seeing great continued adoption and growth in our core areas of colorectal cancer and breast cancer and IO monitoring. We did see pretty strong bumps in bladder cancer and ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer, we just recently got the coverage from Medicare. So it's great to see that reaction from the marketplace and from physicians. In bladder cancer, there's just a lot of opportunity there. And I think that's a pretty underpenetrated space. But both of those together in terms of overall absolute numbers are not as big as the colorectal and breast and IO monitoring.\n So -- and the other thing I'll say is just generally the drivers are which I think Mike or Steve mentioned earlier, just the number of new physicians ordering the test was very strong in Q1, which led to the outperformance? \nOperator: And our final question today comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Sykes: Just, Steve, for you, just more of a longer-term question on women's health. Just given the step-up you saw in Q1, I realized this 1 quarter, but it was a pretty impressive quarter given the level of market share and penetration and assuming Invitae revenues kind of fold in this year. What's now and have you changed your long-term expectation for when women's health as a segment would sort of start to normalize growth just given the I guess, relative maturity of that category and just your penetration of market share. Any thoughts on how you're thinking about it long term in terms of growth? \nSteve Chapman: Yes. So that's a good question. I mean, obviously, we had an incredible Q1. And what we normally see, and this has always been the case in the women's health businesses, a lot of the growth for the year comes in Q1. And then there's a little bit of a dip in Q2 due to seasonality and then we start to see kind of things grow again in the second half of the year. And that's really kind of been the trend for a long period of time. We think we have somewhere around like 50% share and the markets slightly over 50% penetrated. So there's still a long way to go. \n We're actually seeing opportunities, both competitive wins for some of the more established players, but also still new conversions where people are moving from serum screening over to NIPT or on carrier screening, where they're going from looking at just testing a single gene to maybe series of genes or sort of a broader panel.\n So we think there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And I think, obviously, at some point, you start to get more further penetrated in the NIPT space. But we're always innovating and we always have new things coming out, for example, with the Rh launch and these create opportunity for us. And we said before, we've got a lot of new stuff coming out, both on the MRD side, where we said we have product enhancements and new products coming, but also on the women's health side, where we have new products and product enhancements coming. So we're still very excited about the opportunity to help more patients.\n And then keep in mind, it's not just about volume growth, it's also about ASP and revenue growth. And there's still a lot of tests that we're doing today, where we're not getting coverage where we think there's upside opportunity. Particularly, I think we mentioned 22q where we have a very high attachment rate and those are generally not reimbursed. I think there's some opportunities there. Obviously, the guidelines come in, but there's still a lot of room to improve ASPs by increasing coverage for things like carrier screening or even still some of the base panorama testing. So lots of opportunity ahead and we feel good about it. \nMatthew Sykes: Great. And then Mike, just a modeling question. I understand the true-ups are not embedded in the guide. But just given your focus on cash collections, like how should we think about [ true-ups ] over the course of the year? I'm sure there's some unpredictability about it. But just wanted to get your sense for how we should be thinking about these true-ups Q2 through Q4. \nMike Brophy: Yes, it's a good question. I mean the reason why we typically don't include it in the guide, it's not our intention when we set the accrual, we're trying to set it at exactly 100%. But of course, you'd rather collect at 101% and at 95%, for example. So that's on my mind when we set the accrual. I think in terms of the guide, I really -- I don't have a way to tell you, hey, there's going to be x amount of Q2 versus Q4. My goal is just to have the accruals hit 100% and let's see where we land. \nOperator: All right. Thank you, Matt. And ladies and gentlemen, that is our time today. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. On to some of the highlights from our clinical and product road map. In April, we were pleased to mark that we surpassed over 200 peer-reviewed papers as a company. This chart highlights that we have pursued the strategy throughout the history of the company across all key areas of focus with more than 85 papers in women's health, more than 75 in oncology and MRD, and more than 40 in organ health. We've also been published in some of the most highly respected journals in the world, including science, nature and nature medicine. These papers include major breakthroughs in patient care, such as the SMART trial with Panorama, the GALAXY study with Signatera in the proactive trial with Prospera, the latter which was the paper that brought us to the 200 mark. We look forward to growing this even further as we continue generating meaningful evidence to support our road map and our mission.\n In women's health, as Steve mentioned, the launch of our new fetal RhD test was a major advancement in prenatal care and one that really differentiates Natera. The test can be performed alongside Panorama as early as 9 weeks gestation and is designed to determine the fetal Rh status from a maternal blood draw. The launch is particularly timely right now as OB/GYNs are currently facing limited supplies of medication that are traditionally given to RhD negative women to prevent potential complications during pregnancy. The FDA warned about the shortage earlier this year. And following suit, ACOG came out with a statement just in April that supports the use of NIPT for fetal RhD testing essentially to help conserve medication supply. We are proud to offer this test at a time of critical need in the prenatal community.\n Beyond the shortage, we view this launch as a key differentiator for Natera on several fronts. First, the vast majority of other NIPT labs do not offer fetal RhD assessment with only one other test on the market in the U.S. Second, Natera's test is backed by a large validation study that included fetal RhD status confirmed via newborn serology, which is the gold standard, in more than 650 RhD negative pregnancies. This is roughly 10x more patients with confirmed outcomes than validation studies from other labs. The performance was also outstanding, resulting in 100% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. We believe these differentiators, coupled with the highly validated SNP-based technology that's already built into Panorama will allow us to expand our reach into new physician practices.\n Moving to organ health. We had some key announcements during the quarter for both Renasight and Prospera. Starting with Renasight, our genetic test for chronic kidney disease. We are pleased to see a recent guideline update from a leading medical society in nephrology. KDIGO, which stands for kidney disease improving global outcomes. KDIGO updated their clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. This is significant as the guideline had not been updated in more than 10 years. \n The guideline now includes a specific section about the use of genetic testing in CKD and offers a broad range of support, including, number one, stating that genetic tests should be used, among other factors, to establish the cause of CKD; number two, noting that genetic testing can impact the clinical management of CKD patients just as we saw in the RenaCARE study; and number three, recommending a list of clinical indications where genetic testing is particularly informative. And that's the list, which represents the vast majority of CKD patients.\n The updated guideline makes it clear that genetic tests like Renasight are an essential tool for a nephrologist in the management of CKD patients. We believe this was a key milestone for the field of renal genetics, and we expect this guideline to have a positive impact on clinical adoption of Renasight testing. In April, we also published the first major readout from the ProActive trial, which was the largest prospective donor-derived cfDNA study in kidney transplantation with data from the first 1,600 patients approximately. \n The data demonstrated for the first time that Prospera is a leading indicator of rejection as donor cell-free DNA levels were significantly elevated up to 5 months prior to antibody-mediated rejection and up to 2 months prior to T cell-mediated rejection. These results show the value of using Prospera as an ongoing surveillance tool to detect rejections earlier, not just in scenarios that are for cause. Further, the ProActive data once again highlights the outstanding performance of Prospera with an area under the curve of 0.88 and a negative predictive value of 98% in line with performance as published in the previous studies. \n In a pretty short time, Prospera has established itself as the premier choice in transplant monitoring. And based on this strong clinical evidence, we see growing momentum behind Prospera among transplant physicians in the market. Finally, in oncology, on top of the record volume growth that we generated during the quarter, as Steve outlined. We had a steady drumbeat of trial announcements and publications that continue to demonstrate the clinical value of Signatera across tumor types.\n I'm going to hand it over to Alex to provide color on our progress in colorectal, bladder, breast and uterine cancers, starting with an update on the ALTAIR trial where things are on track. Alex? I think you hit all the key points, nothing to add there. Sure. Good question, Puneet. I think no change to our discussion back in San Diego at the conference where we expect that the CRC committee for the NCCN meets regularly once a year, usually in that late summer time frame. And we think that given the timing of the readout that we just described on the call. There's a pretty good chance that they incorporate some of the data that's reported from ALTAIR and we're optimistic that we see something early next year based on the regular timing. We do think the ALTAIR readout is pretty critical for that. But as a reminder, we're seeing really strong adoption and trends in the marketplace based on the existing evidence that we have.\n So Natera being able to achieve its goals in oncology, kind of happen independent of that, but it certainly provides a significant catalyst. And that, together with the expected readout in muscle invasive bladder cancer from the IMvigor011 trial, which should independently, assuming that's a positive readout, which remains to be seen and that would lead to a separate NCCN committee review as well. Yes. Great. First of all, it was really broad-based. I mean, we're seeing great continued adoption and growth in our core areas of colorectal cancer and breast cancer and IO monitoring. We did see pretty strong bumps in bladder cancer and ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer, we just recently got the coverage from Medicare. So it's great to see that reaction from the marketplace and from physicians. In bladder cancer, there's just a lot of opportunity there. And I think that's a pretty underpenetrated space. But both of those together in terms of overall absolute numbers are not as big as the colorectal and breast and IO monitoring.\n So -- and the other thing I'll say is just generally the drivers are which I think Mike or Steve mentioned earlier, just the number of new physicians ordering the test was very strong in Q1, which led to the outperformance?"

            "name": "Alexey Aleshin",
            "content": "Thank you, Solomon. I'll start with colorectal cancer, in particular, the ALTAIR study, where we have an exciting few months in store. As a reminder, ALTAIR is a treatment on molecular recurrence randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study in colorectal cancer that is part of the ongoing CIRCULATE-Japan study. We've been working closely with our partners in Japan and are looking forward to approaching the key milestones you see outlined on the slide here. First and foremost, we recently surpassed the prespecified target of 190 events for the trial, which is a key step in getting to the next phase of statistical analyses for the readout.\n After completion of data analysis by our collaborators in Japan, we plan to announce top line results in August. We expect to present the complete analysis including primary and secondary endpoints at a major conference in the fall. And by the end of the year, we plan to submit the study for peer-reviewed publication. We're very excited to share these results with you as we do believe that this study, if positive, may be one of the most impactful readouts in early-stage CRC in quite some time.\n Also in colorectal cancer, we recently announced in March our participation in the CIRCULATE-France trial which is another randomized Phase III study. We were pleased that Signatera was selected based on the well-validated asset performance characteristics for patient enrollment into this study, which is the only ongoing randomized trial dedicated to studying the benefit of ctDNA testing in low-risk stage II colorectal cancer. It complements our data generation in both CIRCULATE-Japan and North America trials which are also studying MRD guided treatment in colorectal cancer, but in a higher risk population.\n CIRCULATE-France specifically addresses the need for a personalized approach in a population who currently does not receive chemotherapy as the standard of care and with over 44,000 people in France diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. We believe this trial has the potential to improve outcomes for many of these patients and pave the way to adoption and reimbursement of Signatera in France and possibly the European Union. We also had compelling data released in bladder cancer from the ongoing IMvigor011 trial, which is an international randomized Phase III trial being conducted in collaboration with Genentech.\n This is the first time that prospective Signatera data from an ongoing Phase III global study was presented, a milestone for our evidence generation strategy. The first analysis was presented in March at the European Association of Urology Conference and included post surgical outcomes of 171 patients with high-risk bladder cancer, which serially tested negative with Signatera. The analysis showed that patients will remain Signatera-negative without treatment at disease-free survival rates of 92% at 12 months and 88% at 18 months. Furthermore, the overall survival rates were 100% at 12 months and 98% at 18 months. This was a significant improvement versus the baseline expectations set by prior biobank studies, which further underscores the importance of prospective evidence generation.\n These results have been generating interest in the medical community and give us increasing confidence that patients were Signatera-negative after surgery and remain negative under surveillance, might be able to be spared from adjuvant therapy which is the current standard of care for high-risk patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. This concept is being formally evaluated in the randomized NCI-sponsored MODERN study, which we discussed in detail during the last earnings call.\n While this first analysis covered only MRD-negative patients, the MRD-positive arm of the trial, which is investigating the efficacy of Genentech's atezolizumab, drug versus placebo is expected to read out early next year. That trial result is expected to serve as the basis of our first FDA submission for Signatera for companion diagnostic label in bladder cancer. We are optimistic on what this data could mean for the role of Signatera in clinical practice as well as the potential to tailor treatment and improve outcomes for the more than 150,000 muscle invasive bladder cancer cases diagnosed globally each year.\n Moving to the next slide. Here, you can see meaningful data we've generated in common cancers affecting women. Earlier this year, we had a new publication in Gynecologic Oncology, validating the use of Signatera in resected uterine cancer. This is especially timely and important as new diagnoses are rising in the U.S. and mortality rights are also increasing, which is at least partially due to an increase in diagnosis of the more aggressive subtypes of this disease. \n In this study of real-world Signatera utilization, we looked at 267 plasma samples drawn after surgery from 101 women with uterine cancer. As you can see from the Kaplan-Meier curve on the left, the results demonstrate how Signatera is a powerful postsurgical predictor of recurrence. All patients who were Signatera negative after surgery remain recurrence free. All Signatera-positive patients had a 15-fold worse recurrence-free survival. \n Moving to breast cancer. We announced the publication of an expanded cohort from the EBLIS study. The original cohort of 49 patients was published in 2019 with up to 5 years of clinical follow-up. The new expanded cohort had Signatera monitoring in 156 patients across all subtypes of breast cancer with over 1,000 plasma time points being analyzed. It also had clinical follow-up of up to 12 years, which we believe is the longest in the field of ctDNA monitoring. Samples in the study were collected every 6 months starting after the completion of definitive therapy.\n Patients who were Signatera-positive had over a 53 fold increased risk of death compared to those who test a persistently negative on Signatera. The diagnostic lead times were also longer than before with Signatera detection of recurrence up to 3 years before imaging being observed with median lead time of 10.5 months. Altogether, these findings bolster the evidence for long-term monitoring of breast cancer patients who often face late recurrences. These publications build on our commitment to be a leader in women's health. This includes our recent MolDX approval in ovarian cancer as well as our expansion of breast cancer coverage to the neoadjuvant setting.\n Lastly, we continue to make progress on our early cancer detection program with judicious utilization of resources and a data-first strategy. We are completing a large case control study, and we plan for the data to be announced in June. In addition, as we stated before, we are prospectively collecting a large screening cohort of colonoscopy matched blood samples, and we plan to share the results of that study in Q4.\n With that update, let me hand the call back to Mike to cover the financials. Mike? Great Solomon. Few words to add to that, yes. So we did surpass the 190 events. So now the data is really being analyzed. So in August, the results will come out at a top line level. I think there's been a lot of questions about what good looks like? And I think we've previously guided to the MOSAIC study. Obviously, we do not control the guidelines, but we do control generating the data, right, to provide the evidence for those guidelines to hopefully be updated. \n So I think in terms of the guidelines timing, I think let's see what the results look like. And I think at that point, we can kind of provide some more guidance."

            "name": "Steve Chapman",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Let's get into the highlights on the next slide. We had an excellent quarter across the board, and I'm very pleased to share that we met a major milestone in the life cycle of the company and reaching cash flow breakeven in Q1, significantly ahead of schedule. Revenues were up 18% sequentially versus Q4 of 2023 and up 52% compared to Q1 of last year driven by record volume growth and improving ASPs. Volumes were up over 17% sequentially versus Q4 of 2023, which is the fastest sequential growth rate we've seen since 2021, when the volumes were less than half the size they are now.\n We had record volumes across oncology, organ health and women's health. In oncology, we performed 115,000 units in the quarter, representing sequential growth of 17,000 units versus Q4 of last year, a record growth quarter for the company. Women's Health was also particularly strong, up more than 85,000 units versus Q4 of last year. Improving ASPs and continued execution on cost reduction drove a record gross margin of 57% compared to 39% gross margin in Q1 of 2023. All of this momentum puts us in a great position to significantly raise every aspect of the guide for the rest of the year.\n We are now expecting revenues of $1.42 billion to $1.45 billion, which is $100 million above the midpoint of the range we provided in February. We are also raising gross margins from 50% to 53% to a new range of 53% to 55%. And importantly, even as we increase investments in commercial operations and R&D, we are significantly reducing our cash burn guide for the year. Our previous range included a burn of $75 million to $50 million, and we are now projecting to be cash flow breakeven for the full year, plus or minus $25 million.\n We've also had a full slate of clinical and product announcements, including the launch of our fetal RhD test. The vast majority of the NIPT labs do not offer this type of testing and we are particularly pleased to be serving a critical unmet need given the shortage of RhIG treatments available right now in the United States. In Oregon Health, many of you saw the updated KDIGO guidelines that support genetic testing in patients with chronic kidney disease. This was great to see, particularly after the release of the excellent prospective results we read out last year with the RenaCARE study. More recently, we were thrilled to see the publication of our ProActive study in a top journal, which represents the largest perspective donor-derived cell-free DNA study published to date in the kidney transplant space. We think we have strong momentum in organ health and we're excited about driving this forward this year.\n In oncology, we are very encouraged by the analysis released in the randomized prospective Phase III IMvigor011 trial in bladder cancer in which patients that remain negative on serial Signatera testing had excellent outcomes. This is meaningful as it suggests that these MRD-negative patients may be able to forego treatment in favor of Signatera surveillance. This is also being explicitly evaluated in the modern trial which we discussed last quarter. We also had several additional data readouts that we will cover today. We've got a full agenda for the call, and I'm excited to get into the business trends on the next slide.\n The first slide shows our sequential growth in volume between Q4 and Q1, both this year and last year. We had a very strong Q1 for women's health. We saw a nice lift from the Invitae accounts we picked up in January and February, and the transition has been a success, and we're pleased with the results. We also had success organically growing the business. In fact, the majority of our growth in Q1 came from organic new account wins and growth within our existing women's health accounts. Our core advantages continue to shine in the field, and we've got a lot of traction with the launch of our RhD product, which we'll discuss later on the call.\n Organ Health was also a bright spot this quarter. We saw strong sequential growth in Prospera on the back of the ProActive publication and Renasight grew nicely as well, which is promising given that the updated KDIGO guidelines came out very late in the quarter. And in oncology, we delivered our best quarter ever for Signatera unit growth.\n Double-clicking on oncology volumes on the next slide. We typically see our oncology units grow between 7,000 and 10,000 units quarter-over-quarter. In Q1 oncology grew 17,000 units overall, with most of these units coming from the core Signatera clinical business. We are seeing significant gains and new physicians and new patient starts in addition to recurrence monitoring. We think customers came out of ASCO GI excited about the galaxy data in CRC and that helped the quarter, along with the quality, the size and the breadth of our clinical trial data, which is resonating with physicians. We're off to another strong start in Q2. But with that said, we have, of course, see fluctuations in sequential growth as we've seen in the past.\n The next slide shows the significant step-up in revenues we've seen over time, similar to the volume story. We had 18% sequential revenue growth over Q4 of last year and 52% compared to Q1 of last year. This represents some of the fastest revenue growth metrics we generated despite the fact that the revenue base has more than doubled in the last 3 years. In addition to the volume growth, we continue to see ASPs significantly outperforming across all of our major products. Women's health and organ health ASPs were up and Signatera ASPs were above $1,000 in Q1.\n We continue to make progress on Signatera reimbursement, and we think we have a line of sight to continue ASP expansion through the rest of the year. In addition, the rapid improvement in ASP has driven about $34 million in revenue true-ups this quarter. I think that's a very healthy sign for the business as it indicates that cash collections are exceeding our prior estimates. Our growth trends remained strong even when stripping out the true-ups and those don't happen every quarter.\n On the next slide, you can really see the impact of our improving ASP and COGS on gross margin over the last year. Obviously, 57% is a huge number. But even if you strip out the revenue true-ups, we estimate the underlying repeatable gross margin would have been roughly 53%, which is well ahead of our expectations and drives the increase in the guide. We put a ton of resources and management focus on improving ASPs, but I'm equally excited about the COGS execution we generated recently. We have had several internal projects launched, including moving to higher throughput sequencers in both Austin and San Carlos for our prenatal business. \n In addition, we are still expanding our exome capabilities, which will likely drive some short-term increased cost in Signatera COGS, but we are already below our goal of $450 based on the scaling benefits that we expect to stay there for the rest of the year. We are also now getting large rebates from vendors as we hit higher volume tiers in our contracts. We've historically poured a meaningful percentage of our R&D spend into cost reductions and now those lead costs are really paying dividends.\n So all these trends sum to the results on the next slide, which shows our cash burn reduction over time. We set a cash flow breakeven target on the Q1 earnings call about 2 years ago, and we're pleased to have met this goal significantly ahead of schedule. We've been very consistent about the strategy to get here. We've ramped volumes and revenues, increased ASPs and lowered COGS, leading to increased gross margins, and we've done that while maintaining ambitious levels of investment in R&D and commercial activities. We think this formula will allow us to continue delivering excellent financial results while maintaining our leadership position in clinical data generation, new product launches and patient experience.\n In addition, we've achieved this cash flow breakeven goal without the help of any upcoming potential catalysts such as 22q guidelines or NCCN guidelines. Those would still represent further upside along with continuing to execute the core strategy in very large underpenetrated markets. Going through the rest of the year, we may bounce around between positive and negative cash flow quarters depending on the working capital variables, like the timing of insurance payments, timing of CapEx and the lab and other factors. But fundamentally, we think we're in a position to continue to serve more patients and grow the business and drive innovation without continually burning cash.\n And with that said, let me turn it over to Solomon. Solomon? Yes, it's a great question. So when you look at growing, I mean, really with any clinical diagnostic, you want to add new physicians, new accounts and then within the accounts you want to grow the business to increase utilization with the existing physicians. And so with that exactly what we're seeing is once doctors start using Signatera. They tend to increase their utilization and continue using it. And then once one doctor starts within a practice, it tends to sort of spread within the practice. So obviously, ASCO GI, we had some great additional data coming out of the GALAXY study. We think that was received very well, and we're seeing that lead to increased growth.\n Mike, do you want to talk about ASPs? Yes. That's a great question. So I'll comment briefly on KDIGO and Renasight and then Solomon if there's something you want to add. So certainly, we've been having a lot of conversations with physicians about the guideline and those -- it's being very well received. I mean, there's a lot of excitement about the updated guideline. So I think there is a lot of opportunity here to more deeply penetrate this market, which there's, I think, maybe 40 million Americans or something in that range that are sitting with the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. So there's a big opportunity here.\n Really, I think the goal is not necessarily to go get more and more physicians ordering the test. It's to increase the utilization within the accounts, and that's what we're working on now. We do think that the NKF will be coming out with an updated guideline at some point in the future. We hope that comes this year. We don't know exactly what it's going to say. But I think they're obviously working closely with KDIGO and looking at all the new data coming out. So that's exciting.\n And on [ ECD ], I think, obviously, we've got a readout coming pretty soon. So I'll probably just defer comments there until I think we said in June when the case-controlled study reads out. Yes, it's a good question. So I think when Invitae, last announced the numbers, I think, which is maybe in September 2023, things changed quite a bit between that time frame and when we took over at the end of January. And I think they had gotten -- really gotten rid of a lot of that cash pay business in that lower margin business. So when we came in the January generally it was sort of the higher-margin business, except for some of the international where we got what we could, but some of the lower-margin business there, just we weren't able to participate it. \n But most of the business came is on now that we're going to get. And I think a tiny amount in January, a little more ramping up in February. And then I think March was almost a complete month there, but we did really well. So you'll get the kind of full pacing of that quarter of the Invitae volume in Q2. But we did really well based on where we started in January, we got the majority of the business converted over, and we're feeling good about that. But again, there was a pretty significant step down from where we started in January to where they last reported. \n With that said, also you asked about organic growth. The majority of the Q1 volume growth in Women's Health, which was incredible, the 85,000 units I think that is one of the fastest-growing sequential quarters we've ever had in the history of the company. I've mentioned before that we were seeing record units per receiving day in December. There's just a lot of momentum with, I think the differentiators that we have at Natera, I think the data that we've put out, we're starting -- continuing to see, I think, a significant interest from physicians, and that's driving a lot of the organic growth. Yes. Solomon, do you want to make a couple of comments and then maybe Alex, you can jump in. Mike, do you want to take that? Yes. I'll comment on the first question. So one of the things that's really exciting about Natera right now is we're growing rapidly. We're hitting this cash flow of breakeven milestone and we're increasing our investment in the future of the business in both innovation and in the commercial franchise. So it's great to be doing all of those things at one time and seeing the company's strategy working. But at the same time, we're not really forecasting in the impact of these big potential catalysts that could come in the future. \n For example, as you mentioned, the 22q guidelines. And these could be very significant meaningful events in the future if they do come through and they're positive. The guidelines can impact payer coverage policies very quickly like was in a period of sort of 3 to 6 months if the guidelines are very definitive. If the guidelines are a little more vague, it can take longer potentially if it does have an impact at all. And so it really depends on what the guideline says. And we're just going to have to wait and see.\n On the second question, I think Mike that was a question for you. Yes, go ahead. Yes. Solomon, do you want to talk about that? Yes. So that's a good question. I mean, obviously, we had an incredible Q1. And what we normally see, and this has always been the case in the women's health businesses, a lot of the growth for the year comes in Q1. And then there's a little bit of a dip in Q2 due to seasonality and then we start to see kind of things grow again in the second half of the year. And that's really kind of been the trend for a long period of time. We think we have somewhere around like 50% share and the markets slightly over 50% penetrated. So there's still a long way to go. \n We're actually seeing opportunities, both competitive wins for some of the more established players, but also still new conversions where people are moving from serum screening over to NIPT or on carrier screening, where they're going from looking at just testing a single gene to maybe series of genes or sort of a broader panel.\n So we think there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And I think, obviously, at some point, you start to get more further penetrated in the NIPT space. But we're always innovating and we always have new things coming out, for example, with the Rh launch and these create opportunity for us. And we said before, we've got a lot of new stuff coming out, both on the MRD side, where we said we have product enhancements and new products coming, but also on the women's health side, where we have new products and product enhancements coming. So we're still very excited about the opportunity to help more patients.\n And then keep in mind, it's not just about volume growth, it's also about ASP and revenue growth. And there's still a lot of tests that we're doing today, where we're not getting coverage where we think there's upside opportunity. Particularly, I think we mentioned 22q where we have a very high attachment rate and those are generally not reimbursed. I think there's some opportunities there. Obviously, the guidelines come in, but there's still a lot of room to improve ASPs by increasing coverage for things like carrier screening or even still some of the base panorama testing. So lots of opportunity ahead and we feel good about it."
