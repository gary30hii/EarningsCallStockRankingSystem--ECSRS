All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. The call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nChris DelOrefice: Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and our financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there's significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook is a best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. Alex will provide perspective on our overall results and business highlights for the year. I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment, and our guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. I would now turn the call over to Alex to share our overall results and business highlights.\nAlex Gorsky: Thank you, Chris. And thank you everyone for taking time to join us today to discuss our full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. At the start of last year, no one could have imagined just how drastically our lives were about to change because of a virus that would impact billions of people around the world. By any measure, 2020 was a year dominated by uncertainty, yet the pandemic also helped to clarify both our priorities and our values. And within Johnson & Johnson, it has illustrated the power and importance of our credo in guiding our actions to meet the needs of all our stakeholders. Now because of COVID-19, we now have a deeper appreciation on just how pivotal good health is to our safety, security, and prosperity as a society. We have a profound respect and gratitude for all the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff serving on the frontlines of care, for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up every day to keep the world's critical infrastructure up and running, and expectations that companies can and should help drive positive change in the society are higher than ever. As the world's largest and most broadly based global health care company, Johnson & Johnson was built for times like these. We've been leading through the world's biggest public health challenges for over a century. And today, our diversified businesses touch so many parts of people's lives. We had both the ability and the responsibility to act when the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a global pandemic. Within weeks of the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus, Janssen scientists were working 24/7 to identify the most promising lead candidate for a vaccine. I'm proud of the progress of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and the fact that we moved so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of our vaccine and supply chain teams. We look forward to sharing further details from our Phase 3 study by early next week. Additionally, I'm just as proud of the ways that each of my Johnson & Johnson colleagues have gone above and beyond the call of duty to provide uninterrupted access to our medicines, embrace radically new ways of working, and use the full breadth and depth of our expertise to deliver our important medicines and products to patients and consumers and support health care systems that have been overwhelmed by the pandemic. The fact that we've been able not just to weather this crisis but bring our broad-based capabilities to support this crisis and deliver on a shorter term top and bottom line business goals, while increasing our investments in innovation at record levels is a remarkable testament to our purpose-driven culture and the core strengths that characterize our Company for over a century; execution, innovation, and people. Our relentless focus on excellence and execution is key to meeting the needs of all our stakeholders today and tomorrow. The performance of our business in 2020 reflects the continued confidence from patients, physicians, customers, and consumers in our life-saving medicines and products. Our Pharmaceutical business performed well above market, kept pipeline submissions and approvals on track, and exceeded patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. Our Consumer Health business also performed above market for the year, and our Medical Devices business demonstrated resiliency and agility leading to a strong second half recovery. Our unparalleled scientific expertise allowed us to create life-enhancing innovation. Our R&D colleagues across Johnson & Johnson have continued to advance our robust pipeline of innovative and transformational new products. Of note, we initiated our U.S. filing for our BCMA Car-T in multiple myeloma in December. In addition, we filed amivantamab for the treatment of Exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Europe. Our Medical Devices business has made strong progress advancing our pipeline, despite the pandemic, achieving and even accelerating certain key milestones throughout the year. As you heard from Ashley, Dr. Moll and the team at the Medical Devices Update in November, we are developing an end-to-end digital ecosystem across three robotics platforms, and we achieved a significant milestone this month receiving FDA clearance for our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We believe the industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of robotic and digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned to bring innovative, differentiated solutions to the surgery suite over the next 10, 20, and 30 years. I'm also very proud of the great work from our supply chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner even honored Johnson & Johnson with a number 3 ranking across all industries on its Annual 2020 Supply Chain Top 25 Index. That's up five spots from our 2019 ranking. Gartner also awarded Johnson & Johnson the number one spot on its 2020 Health care Supply Chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And finally, we are powered by our people, purpose, and value system. More than 75 years since it was authored, our credo continues to guide all 135,000 of us at Johnson & Johnson. So, with that in mind, I want to highlight a recent appointment to our Board of Directors, an incredibly high honor awarded to one of our own directors. In December, Johnson & Johnson appointed retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General and former U.S. Army Surgeon General, Dr. Nadja West to our Board of Directors. Dr. West\u2019s accomplished healthcare background in addition to her deep strategic leadership experience are strong additions to our Board of Directors. In October, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Board Director, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, along with her colleague, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the revolutionary discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, considered to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in molecular biology in the past decade. We are truly proud of her recognition for this incredible work. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in both, our workforce and the communities at which we serve has always been an important part of our culture. However, the past year has also shown a spotlight on the fact that we can all do more. To that end, I am proud of our Race to Health Equity platform launched in November. Our Race to Health Equity aims to help improve racial equity by eliminating health inequities for people of color and our $100 million commitment to invest in and promote health equity. I'm excited to be part of this progress and for Johnson & Johnson to play a part in impactful, lasting change. And most importantly, the talented and committed people at Johnson & Johnson drive our success by putting the patients and consumers we serve around the world at the forefront of all we do. We think and rely on them to continue to innovate, execute and focus on our shared purpose to deliver better health for everyone everywhere. I look forward to addressing your questions during the Q&A portion of the webcast. Right now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to share details related to our performance for the quarter. Thank you. Chris?\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Alex. Now, to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 8.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.1% as currency had a positive impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.3% worldwide, 9.6% in the U.S. and 4.8% outside the U.S. As referenced on prior calls, I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, it does not represent a full week of sales but rather a few more shipping days with these additional shipping days adding approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. This can be roughly applied across all segments. The additional sales were more heavily skewed to the U.S. For the enterprise, offsetting this sales benefit was the estimated negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, while these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the impact to earnings was negligible. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $1.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.50 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.86, representing decreases of 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.2%. For the full year 2020, consolidated sales were $82.6 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2019. Operationally, full year sales grew 1.2% with currency having a negative impact of 0.6 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year change was negative 1.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. declined by 0.2% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.5% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S. and 0.2% outside the U.S. Net earnings for the full year 2020 were $14.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.51 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.63 a year ago. 2020 adjusted net earnings were $21.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.03, representing decreases of 8.1% and 7.5%, respectively, versus full year 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 7.8%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2020 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.6 billion and grew 2% with growth in the U.S. of 2.7% and 1.5% outside of the U.S. Consumer Health delivered strong above-market growth due to our Oral Care, Wound Care and OUS Skin Health/Beauty businesses partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19, primarily in our OTC business and the SKU rationalization program, which predominantly impacted Baby and Skin Health/Beauty outside the U.S. E-commerce growth continues to be strong across regions and franchises. Over-the-counter medicines had a decline of 1.5%. In the U.S., OTC sales were flat and the OUS declined by 2.9%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences, impacting children's TYLENOL, global cough and cold and digestive products. Offsetting these declines was strong adult TYLENOL market and share growth attributed to elevated demand, driven by COVID-19, ZYRTEC share growth, partially due to competitive out-of-stock and strong market growth in anti-smoking aids in EMEA. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise experienced recovery with a 2.6% increase, driven by strong performance of OGx due to share gains and OUS growth for Dr. Ci Labo, partially offset by NEUTROGENA declines as retailers carry less inventory, coupled with market declines, primarily in the makeup category due to fewer use occasions driven by COVID-19 restrictions and SKU rationalization. As consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, Oral Care grew by 12% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new flavor and product innovations and the increased demand globally related to COVID-19. Wound Care grew 12.2%, primarily due to strong performance across NEOSPORIN and BAND-AID brand adhesive bandages in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. In the baby franchise, we saw AVEENO baby strength, offset by our planned SKU rationalization program, primarily outside the U.S. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.3 billion grew 14.6%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 15.3% and OUS sales increasing by 13.5%. The business realized double-digit growth in 8 key products across our portfolio, supporting growth in all therapeutic areas except for cardiovascular metabolism, other, which experienced a decline of 1%, primarily driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver our ninth consecutive year of global adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. Our oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 23.7%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 49%, led by share gains globally with the U.S. market share up about 4 points across all lines of therapy. Furthermore, the U.S. and European markets continue to exhibit increased adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the recent U.S. approval of DARZALEX FASPRO for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain amyloidosis. IMBRUVICA grew 25.3% globally, mainly driven by market growth and our strong leadership position in all key indications. We continue to progress the development of IMBRUVICA to further differentiate this BTK inhibitor, as evidenced by the robust data presentation at the American Society of Hematology Conference in December. ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum with sales of just over $240 million in the quarter, driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 15.3%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. STELARA grew 30.3%, driven by global demand increase in Crohn's Disease with over a 5-point share increase in the U.S. and continued growth in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA grew 39.3% and is up about 3 points of share from the fourth quarter of 2019 in the psoriasis market in U.S. TREMFYA continues to strengthen its leadership position as the most prescribed IL-23 inhibitor for patients worldwide through its differentiated data package in both, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We also continued to advance TREMFYA\u2019s pipeline as evidenced by Phase 2 Crohn's Disease data that was presented earlier this year. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 9%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In 2020, we filed submissions in the U.S. and EU for paliperidone palmitate six-month formulation for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. And if approved, it will be the first and only long-acting injectable medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 37.4% with OPSUMIT growth of 36.7% and UPTRAVI growth of 44.1%, both driven by market penetration and share growth, as well as a onetime benefit of about 10 points each, resulting from the U.S. distributor model change we communicated in Q4 2019. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, declining 2.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 1.5% worldwide. Onetime items positively impacted the current quarter by about 200 basis points. The net benefit from these onetime items is comprised of the benefit of the extra shipping days associated with the 53rd week, partially offset by the anticipated inventory contractions in China across our portfolio, and in our U.S. contact lens business, as communicated last quarter. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, Q4 results were in line with Q3 2020 performance. COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable within the medical device market. In Q4, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels in certain parts of the world while cases remain relatively stable in others. This did lead to some softening in recovery trends late in the quarter. However, impacts varied across geographies and procedure types. Looking geographically, China, where COVID-19 cases have continued to remain more stable, delivered double-digit growth within the quarter. Excluding the benefit of the additional shipping days, the U.S. declined low single digits, due to COVID-19-related restrictions occurring late in the quarter. Sales also declined in Europe, where some of the strictest restrictions were deployed to curb the increases in COVID-19 cases. As we have noted previously, health care systems continue to demonstrate their resiliency and dedication to treating both, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, resulting in significantly less disruption during this recent surge of cases versus the impact seen earlier this year. Interventional Solutions continue to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 12.7% globally led by market recovery and share gains from new products. CERENOVUS returned to double-digit growth with strong sales in China. Worldwide orthopedics declined 5.3% versus prior year, driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 where procedures deem to be more elective in nature. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 3.6% globally. U.S. growth of 10% for the quarter reflects market recovery as well as success of our new products, such as the cannulated compression headless screws. Declines of about 6% outside the U.S. reflects slower procedural volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as contractions in inventory in China worth around 400 basis points. Worldwide hips declined 2.7%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the market. U.S. declined 0.7% versus prior year and continues to benefit from our leadership position in an interior approach and strong demand for the active stem and enabling technologies, helping to partially offset the negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to introduce innovation in this space, and in December, we entered the modular dual mobility market with the first implant of PINNACLE dual mobility, which is planned for a full U.S. market launch this year. These declined 13.9% globally as we continue to see procedures in this space highly impacted by COVID-19, especially revision procedures, where we have a higher share than primary. The 20.6% decline outside of the U.S. reflects the impacts of COVID-19 on procedures, especially in markets like the UK and India, where we hold higher share positions. We are very excited about the FDA clearance of our VELYS orthopedic robotic system and bringing this to the U.S. market in 2021. The combination of the differentiated robotic system with our ATTUNE knee platform are expected to drive enhanced performance in this segment. Worldwide decline in spine of 7.1% reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the market as well as inventory reductions in China impacting global performance by about 350 basis points. Offsetting this decline is the growth we continue to see from the success of recent launches of new products such as SYMPHONY and CONDUIT. For the quarter, U.S. price remained consistent with historical levels, down low single digits. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced surgery returned to growth with a 2% increase versus prior year, led by strong performance in U.S. biosurgery, which grew 12.1% in the quarter. U.S. biosurgery growth is due to the strength of SURGIFLO and the continued recovery from the previously disclosed 2019 stopped shipment. Endocutters delivered 1.6% growth, mainly driven by the success of new products in China, offsetting impacts from COVID-19. Energy declined by 3.1%, reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S., partially offset by the strength of new products outside the U.S. This month, we received FDA 510(k) clearances for both, the ENSEAL X1 Curved and Straight Jaw Tissue Sealer instruments, which will further strengthen our portfolio of advanced energy devices. Global wound closure grew by 1.5% through the strength of STRATAFIX barbed suture and PRINEO topical skin adhesive products in both, the U.S. and OUS markets. Inventory dynamics in the quarter added about 350 basis points to the U.S. growth of 8.5% and negatively impacted the OUS decline of 2.9% by about 150 basis points. The vision business declined 6.6% globally. U.S. contact lens declined 7.1%. However, after adjusting for the impact of both, the additional shipping days this quarter and the impact of the anticipated channel inventory correction communicated last quarter, worth about 9 points, the underlying U.S. contact lens business grew and continues to deliver competitive performance. While surgical vision declined 10.1% globally, this represents an improvement from Q3 where the business declined 16.4% with the most notable improvement in the U.S. This improvement is due to both, improvement in the cataract and refractive markets as well as new products like TECNIS Toric II IOL for astigmatism. Now, regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported earlier, our adjusted EPS of $1.86 reflects a reported decrease of 1.1% and an operational decrease of 3.2%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly, primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed cost, impacting the medical device business, partially offset by favorable enterprise portfolio mix and portfolio mix within the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved for the quarter as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical and consumer businesses, partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 17.9% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 by 230 basis points, driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net expense of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $16 million last year. This was primarily driven by higher litigation expenses related to a Missouri Supreme Court verdict on talc in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was previously disclosed in our November 3 8-K filing and we intend to seek review of that decision by the United States Supreme Court. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate decreased from 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a 5.5% benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decline was primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with the fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 11.4% versus 10.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-K for further details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.1% to 24.9%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 impact this quarter. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices declined by 900 basis points, driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. Consumer margins improved by 430 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including execution of our SKU rationalization program. The decline in Pharmaceutical margins of 90 basis points was primarily driven by investment in R&D associated with portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine. This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. Please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule, where again, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported today, our full year 2020 adjusted EPS of $8.03 reflects a reported decrease of 7.5% and an operational decrease of 7.8%. The decline is primarily related to COVID-19 impacts realized predominantly in our medical device business, along with increased R&D investment, including the investment associated with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2020 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise decreased by 360 basis points versus 2019. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices declined from 35.4% in the previous year to 17%, primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. 2019 also includes approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 200 basis points to 42%, driven by favorable product mix and sales, marketing and administrative expense leveraging. Consumer margins improved by 240 basis points to 23.8% driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including the execution of our SKU rationalization program. Moving on to important developments. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. For your planning purposes, we plan to host a business review, featuring our Pharmaceutical business on November 18th of this year. The format and location will be announced at a later date, but we hope that you're able to join us for this event, where we look forward to sharing the details about our robust pipeline and differentiated capabilities, that gives us the confidence in our ability to sustain growth in Pharmaceuticals at above-market levels. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation, despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwavering commitment of our 135,000 global colleagues was on full display, delivering trusted, life-saving, life-enhancing products to patients and consumers around the world. Their efforts resulted in sound shareholder returns while advancing value-creating opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders now and over the long term. Alex stated on this call and really throughout 2020 that Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. Our disciplined, long-term focus yields a financial strength that affords us the ability to quickly act to address the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, most notably on our ongoing vaccine development, but to also continue investing in innovative solutions to better the future of health care even when short-term uncertainty exists. I am very pleased today to share our financial guidance for 2021, which reflects these principles. But, first, let me review our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of $20 billion, surpassing last year's record high. We did benefit by having our fiscal year-end lapse into 2021, as Chris noted, and we are now planning for a payment related to the anticipated final opioid litigation agreement in principal in 2021 versus the previous planned 2020 payment. In terms of our cash position at the end of 2020, we had approximately $10 billion of net debt, comprised of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. One element of our business that we're particularly proud of that despite the challenges of 2020 offered, we maintained our long-term approach to drive growth and value creation across the enterprise. From an innovation standpoint, the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a top priority throughout the year. Yet, as I said earlier, we continued to make other strategic investments that fortified our pipeline and further enhanced our competitive advantage even during the pandemic. Our level of R&D investment reached an all-time high of $12.1 billion, $800 million more than our 2019 R&D investment. On the transaction front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that strategically complement our portfolio and where our scientific expertise or commercial capabilities can create unique value. Over the course of 2020, we invested over $7 billion in such opportunities. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October, we acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals and a lead therapeutic candidate, nipocalimab, which is in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of rare autoantibody-driven diseases. We believe nipocalimab encompasses a pipeline and a product opportunity that can treat a broad range of devastating autoantibody-driven diseases. In December, we expanded our retina pipeline by acquiring the rights to Hemera Biosciences investigational gene therapy, HMR59, a onetime outpatient intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a severe form of age-related macular degeneration, where currently, there are no other approved therapies. And as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson have come to expect, we continue to prioritize our dividend by announcing last April a 6.3% increase. This translated in returning $10.5 billion to investors in 2020, approximately 50% of our free cash flow. Let's now turn to our full year 2021 guidance. Given our full year 2020 performance in this unprecedented environment and the underlying strength of our broad-based business, we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor and work with health care systems around the globe as they balance surges in COVID-19 cases with treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the tremendous efforts of health care providers around the world that have society in a much better place today with improved treatment protocols and resource allocation compared to the start of the pandemic. We are also encouraged by the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines that will provide added reassurance to people in need of medical procedures. From a macroeconomic perspective, our outlook assumes stabilizing employment levels and a reduction in social restrictions as the year progresses. From a legislative standpoint, we are not assuming significant changes in current tax policy, and consistent with the past four years in our Pharmaceuticals business, we expect net price decreases at similar levels. We will continue to focus on providing access to more patients for our innovative products, resulting in growth being volume-driven. So, let's get into the details for full year 2021 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. I'd like to note upfront that our guidance excludes the financial impact from the potential distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. As Alex noted, we remain committed to provide a safe and effective vaccine. Being in the final stages of a robust 45,000-person study, analytics will be completed, and we plan to report out the results by early next week. Therefore, it would be premature to speculate. We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates, as warranted, likely during our first quarter earnings call in April. Starting with sales. We expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2021 of between 8.0% and 9.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points and as such are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 7.5% to 9.0%, or $88.8 billion to $90.0 billion. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movement. But for some context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.21, there is an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 9.5% and 11.0% or 10.3% at the midpoint compared to 2020 or $90.5 billion to $91.7 billion. Let's now turn to earnings per share. This slide illustrates the components of our 2021 EPS guidance. Roughly half of our EPS growth is attributed to the robust operational sales growth and the other half is attributable to strong net income margin improvement, driven by expected operating margin improvement of more than 200 basis points versus 2020. The medical device COVID-19 recovery and other cost improvement initiatives are planned to more than offset our continued investment to accelerate our business and further strengthen our pipeline of new products for the long term. As a reminder, included in our 2021 guidance is the dilution from the recent acquisition of Momenta, negatively impacting EPS by about $0.15 or $0.10 versus 2020. Considering these items, results in adjusted operational EPS in a range of $9.25 to $9.45 or $9.35 at the midpoint, reflecting a 16.4% year-over-year increase. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 18.3% versus the prior year. Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of what I just shared along with some additional P&L items, to give you more insight into the drivers of our full year guidance. Beginning with other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, litigation and write-offs. As I discussed on previous earnings calls, we will continue to be rigorous regarding portfolio management, but going forward, we will not include the impact of significant divestiture gains in adjusted EPS. Given those considerations, we would be comfortable with your models for 2021, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from between $600 million and $700 million. We continue to actively evaluate external value-creating opportunities, but for purposes of your financial models, we are not assuming any major acquisitions or other major uses of cash at this time. Therefore, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2021 in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% or a midpoint of 17% due to beneficial onetime items in 2020 related to the closeout of audits in several jurisdictions that will not repeat in 2021. Let me spend a few minutes providing some qualitative context about 2021, although not intended to specifically provide segment or quarterly guidance. Given variability that occurred due primarily to COVID-related dynamics, this slide, while not to scale and meant to be illustrative, offers some perspectives on the quarterly phasing across our businesses. From a sales perspective, as Chris noted earlier, we benefited from additional selling days in 2020 that will not repeat in 2021. That should be applied to both, the full year and the fourth quarter for the enterprise and by segment. I'll address each segment starting with Pharmaceuticals, where we anticipate another strong year of above-market growth. Throughout 2020, we saw COVID-19-driven fluctuations, and most pronounced was the first quarter when, as we noted, we benefited from longer script durations. We continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccine development, impacting the first quarter while we pursue authorization. For 2021, we expect more balanced quarter-to-quarter growth. Lastly, while we expect to continue to face pricing pressures and the ongoing negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, we do not expect any significant new generic or biosimilar entrants in 2021. Turning to our Medical Device segment. As mentioned earlier, we observed instances of nonemergency procedure postponements late in the fourth quarter, but health care systems continue to meet the needs of both, COVID and non-COVID patients, resulting in less COVID-19 market disruption as we progressed through 2020. While macro market dynamics such as vaccine deployment, unemployment and health care coverage remain fluid, we are anticipating some moderate procedural disruption to carry into the first quarter but expect continued medical device market improvement throughout 2021 fluctuating by quarter. As you heard during our Medical Device update in November, our core platforms continue to strengthen, driven by enhanced execution and improved cadence of innovation and filling critical portfolio gaps, including and most notably, advancing our future digital surgery offerings. We believe the combination of the expected market recovery and the actions taken to strengthen our device business positions us to drive revenue growth each quarter versus 2020 with some continued headwinds due to COVID-19 tempering growth in the first quarter and the highest growth rate expected in the second quarter, given the significant market disruption realized in the second quarter of 2020. Our Consumer Health segment yielded solid performance throughout the pandemic, resulting in above-market growth. But as noted on our third quarter earnings call, that performance is likely to yield negative COVID-related sales comparisons in the first quarter of 2021, primarily in over-the-counter products. We also plan that our continued SKU rationalization program will have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2021 while we continue progressing our margin expansion. For the second half, we would anticipate more normalized growth as consumers return to more typical usage patterns for products in areas like Skin Health and Beauty. Therefore, although not linear, for the full year, we anticipate growing competitively with the markets in which we compete. We are confident in the strength of our broad-based business and its underlying fundamentals. We are positioned to deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders, not just in 2021, but over the long term. Alex and I look forward to addressing your questions. So, I'm now pleased to turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A session. Chris?\nChris DelOrefice: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Good morning. Thanks again for all the work you're doing to combat the pandemic and looking forward to the vaccine data next week. I was just wondering, with respect to the vaccine trial, if you can remind us what percentage of participants were enrolled in South Africa and Brazil, and if you're gathering sequencing data from these participants that become infected. And when you report the data, are you going to break out results by geography? And hence, will we have any insight in terms of the vaccine efficacy against some of these new variants? Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey Terence, this is Alex. Thank you very much for your question. Look, maybe before I answer this -- your question, let me just back up for a higher level, and once again, note, what I think has just been the tremendous contributions and performance of our 150,000 approximate associates around the world, 50,000 of whom have been going to work every day in our factories and our laboratories to ensure the products and services could continue to flow to patients and hospital systems around the world, let alone the important work that we're doing on the vaccine. Next, I also just think it's very important to reflect on the tremendous impact that COVID-19 has had around the world. You've heard some of the numbers that we mentioned earlier today, whether it's almost 100 million cases around the world, let alone 2 million deaths globally or right here in the United States, almost 25 million people and over 400,000 deaths, that's taken a tremendous cost on certainly families, individuals, businesses, our economy on just so many different aspects of our life that all the more important for us to be doing everything we can to make a difference during this pandemic. Last but not least, I'm just very proud of the performance that we had, not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2020. If you look at the various segments, in almost each of our sectors, all of our major platforms, what you saw is us ending the year in a better position than where we started. And that wasn't only for what I would call the near-term financial performance where we saw things like market share gains and position improvements, but also if you look at the investment that we made in research and development, in sales and marketing preparing for the future not only 2021, but that and beyond, again we think we're well-positioned and stronger as we finished the year than even when we began. Now, getting back to your specific question regarding the breakouts, we're going to have much more information in the coming days. We think it's very important to follow the data, to follow the science. At that time, we think it will be more appropriate to provide you with all of the various cuts of the data that we anticipate having. Consistent with the statements that we made from the very beginning, we want to ensure that we've got a very robust program not only geographically, but also by ethnicity, gender, as well as a number of other different parameters, all as part of an effort to give us the best possible understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine, so stay tuned. As Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, and Chris we expect to have these results in the coming days. And our scientists, Dr. Mathai Mammen, Dr. Paul Stoffels, and others will be providing much more detail once we have those results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: One more, one on the vaccine and then one financial question. So, Alex or Joe, I heard Joe's comments on CNBC about your expectations for the vaccine to be robust. What do you think you need to show to be competitive? Is 70% a good floor? And Joe, do you still expect to produce 1 billion doses in 2021? And just lastly, I know you said that you're not going to give any financial guidance until I think your next call. But since the data is coming next week, any color on pricing and margins during and after the pandemic? Thanks, guys.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey Larry, thank you very much for your question. As I mentioned earlier, I think it would be inappropriate for us to speculate in any significant way, given the proximity that we are today versus when we expect the results. What we said from the very beginning is that we put a lot of work and thought and very strong science and review into the selection of our lead candidate. I think, the Phase 1 and 2a results, particularly those that were recently published, we are hopeful that's a good precursor to the kind of efficacy and safety that we'll see in larger population, of course, until we see this final data. We won't know for certain, but look we remain optimistic, and we're going to remain very diligent as we go through this final review. I'll hand it over to Joe to take the second part of that question.\nJoe Wolk: Sure. Good morning, Larry. And thanks for the question. I would say with respect to supply, consistent with the comments that were made earlier, we intend to meet all of the firm order commitments that we have, whether that be to the United States, to the European Union or to developing countries through the Gavi organization. And right now, we're well on track to do that. As Alex alluded to, there is still some fluidity with respect to timelines. And I think what we're seeing happening with a little bit of confusion is people are trying to parse this down into weeks. I think, the definitive statement here is that we are very comfortable in meeting our commitments to those respective countries or organizations that I just outlined. In terms of financial implications and pricing, as you can imagine once countries get a chance to see the data, we're in active negotiations for other countries and other organizations, and the volume will impact the selling price. So, it's somewhat of a fluid situation, and that's why we're kind of projecting or leading folks to think about the April first quarter earnings call as a good time when many of those pieces will be in place, and we can give you some credible information to bank on for the balance of 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: I guess just -- maybe just two quick ones here for me. The one would just be just in general, as you think about new variants in the marketplace and the need for a booster. I wonder if you could just comment on number one, when can we expect the dual dose data, and what are your thoughts about the booster relative to the mRNA-based platforms? And then, I guess, just on earnings strength for next year, '21, Joe, just 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion, just seems like given the earnings upside relative to consensus estimates, you probably need a margin number that is maybe closer to 300 basis points of year-on-year upside versus 200. So just give us any sense of what's driving margin strength, some of that's medical device recovery. I'm sure some of that's pharma strength as well. But, it'd be super helpful, just give us a sense of the earnings momentum into '21. Thanks so much.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey David, this is Alex. I'll take the first part and then let Joe take the second one. Look, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to pull together all of our data. We're enrolling, as we speak, in the dual dose information. We would expect that -- to have that in the back end of this year. And again, as we -- just as we try to be very transparent and very thorough in the disclosure that we're releasing, we certainly will plan to follow that course with that trial as well. And again, we'll get out information as soon as we can. Regarding some of the variants, obviously, we're watching that closely, based upon some of the regional, the geographical differences that we've seen. And look, our scientists are already anticipating, as you heard from some of the other companies, about what are potential scenarios to ensure that we're prepared. But look, I think, it starts with taking a look at the data that we currently have that we should have shortly. And I think Dr. Paul Stoffels and Dr. Mathai Mammen, once we have that, will be able to give a much more comprehensive review on exactly how we think our vaccine will work against the current strains and variants and our plans for the future. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Good morning, David. With respect to kind of the earnings outlook and specifically, the operating margins, you're correct. And not to get cute, but the words were actually greater than 200 basis points. So, that could gravitate upward. We certainly want to keep the flexibility that we've had even during 2021 and all that uncertainty to continue to invest in innovative ideas that really fortify, not just this year, but well beyond. In terms of some of the programs we have that are improving our operating margins, I'd point you to this consumer SKU rationalization. That is certainly something that will have an impact on consumer sales in the first half of the year, but again, with this objective of improving profit margins, and that team has done a great job under Thibaut\u2019s leadership with respect to improving the margin profile over the last two years. You may also recall a few years back made significant investments in our supply chain infrastructure. Some of those are starting to pay off in 2021 as well. And then, like it or not, we are working differently, and there are efficiencies that correlate to some of this working differently. I'm not suggesting that we found a steady state in terms of the balance between virtual work and work in the office, but there are some efficiencies that are being realized that I think will actually sustain long term as we move forward. So, those are some of the factors that are going into our bullish call of above 200 basis points margin improvement.\nOperator: Next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nLouise Chen: So, just curious if you could comment on the durability of your vaccine versus the other vaccines that are in development or at least your goals for durability, you did highlight that you your Phase 1/2 data. And the second question is just as Biden rolls out on his health care policies, are there any big moving parts that you see as potential pushes and pulls to the health care industry? Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey Louise, Alex. Thanks again for your question. Regarding durability, again, we're going to have to see how some of the early data in some of the preclinical work that we have done plays out in the actual large-scale trials. We're certainly hopeful that you're going to see a durable and a sustainable and patent response, particularly from our vector approach. We have seen that in other programs that we run. So, we're hopeful that we'll see it here, but we would expect that to play out. We are pleased with not only the antibody response that we saw but also some of the cellular level response that would be in T cells. But again, more information will be available once we have our other final results. Secondly, more broadly, about health care, I do think that -- and we do feel that COVID-19 has had a very profound effect on health care systems, both near term and short -- and longer term. I think, in the near term, what we've learned is frankly the importance of innovation and science. And if you reflect back on where we were, just 11 or 12 months ago at the beginning of COVID-19 and where we are now in the number, not only of very innovative vaccine candidates, but therapeutics and the differences that they made. If you take a look at the way hospital protocols very rapidly and quickly started to using data sciences and information to better understand what was going on with patients entering those facilities, how they should be treated, what led to better outcomes, how that's impacted the reduction in morbidity, I think clearly, another example. Third, we've seen a rapid expansion in telehealth, and that's in primary care offices but also specialty offices. The way that companies like ours actually communicate and engage and educate physicians and health care systems, we would see that lasting for some time as well. And clearly, on the public health side, we think that's also a very important dynamic for us to consider going forward. I mean, I think it's clear from this that the world now has a much better understanding of the importance of well-established, well-funded global public health programs, without which we're at significant risk around the world, whether it's our economies, society, just at a number of different levels. So, those are perhaps some of the longer term trends. And last but not least, I'd like to do a -- just a shout out for the partnership and collaboration that we've seen with not only within industry and across industry but also with regulators around the world. And it's certainly our hope that we can take some of that and apply it to other advancements, whether it's cures for cancer, neuroscience, other conditions. If we can take some of those same paradigms and accelerations and apply them there, that would be great news, not only for patients, certainly in health care systems, but for the industry as well.\nJoe Wolk: Hey Louise, maybe just one other comment to build upon Alex's commentary is that you've referenced towards the end of your question about the new administration and what kind of policies they may have around health care. What I would say is we've been around for 135 years. It's I think 24 different administrations from both, Republican and Democrat. We're going to continue to do what we do best, and that's to innovate. And if I look at our pharmaceutical portfolio, the great performance that they delivered in 2020 was once again met with, for the fourth consecutive year, price decreases overall in the portfolio. So, we're seeing the benefit of innovation, whether it be for the COVID-19 vaccine or other solutions in immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and neuroscience. And so, that's what we're going to be focused on. And by the way, Louise, I just got a comment. You did a really nice job on the news program this morning. That was outstanding work by you.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey Louise, I might just add one other point and that is, we actually look forward to working with the new administration on issues related to health care. Clearly, the pandemic we feel will shape the perspective in terms of the prioritization around access, around innovation, and frankly, using this as an opportunity to improve the overall health care system.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.\nChris Schott: Just on 2021 device sales, can you just help us quantify or provide more color around how much of an impact COVID will still be having on sales, but what you consider to be I guess normalized levels? I'm just trying to get a sense of how close to normalized is 2021 as we maybe think about 2022 and beyond? Is there another step-up in sales we need to be thinking about in that time frame? My second quick one was just on STELARA. The product is obviously generating very healthy growth, despite increased competition in the psoriasis space. Maybe a little bit more color there in terms of the sustainability of growth you see as we just think about that franchise evolving over time? Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Chris, look, overall, we remain very confident in the long-term prospects around the medical device market. And I think we saw very good signs of that actually over the course of 2020, where we saw the medical device market drop anywhere from 30% to up to 70%, depending on which category you're looking at, to return to mid-single-digit drops in the third quarter as we went through the rest of the year. As Joe and I believe Chris alluded to earlier in some of their commentary, we would expect see continued impact certainly in the first quarter of 2021, although the early signs, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in hospitals' ability to manage through some of the current patient demands. There are certainly regions and hospitals around the world, let alone in the United States, where you see a tremendous strain on the systems. But overall, we're seeing hospital volumes decrease no more than about 10% or 15% in areas such, for example, in the UK, a couple of other places in Europe. But overall, the resiliency and the ability of the hospital systems that continue with elective surgeries has improved quite significantly. And as you -- as I'm sure you would project, if we look at second quarter, in particular, the year-on-year comparison should return. As we look at our team's performance and consider 2021, we're actually looking at 2019 as more of a benchmark to -- and to use that as an indicator more of what a baseline or normal would be. But again, we can -- we would expect to continue to see expansion over the course of 2021. And beyond that again see a return to a market that was growing in the mid-single-digits previously, and we would expect that to continue going forward as well.\nChris DelOrefice: There was also a question about STELARA.\nAlex Gorsky: Yes. Regarding STELARA, look, we remain very upbeat on the overall performance of STELARA. I mean, if you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, it was about 30% growth for the full year. We are looking at 20% growth. And what's really important to remember about STELARA is just the diversity of indications now that we have with that compound, especially in GI conditions, where we think it's particularly differentiated and unique, both in terms of its efficacy and now a very robust safety profile as well, based upon the years of experience. It is a competitive category. There are a number of new agents. But we also know that this is an area of significant unmet medical need, again, particularly in the Crohn\u2019s space and the rest of the GI category. And so, we think there remains really good opportunity for us to continue to not only maintain but grow our position.\nJoe Wolk: And Chris, if you look at where the growth is coming from for STELARA in recent quarters, it has been in the GI indications that Alex has noted where we're really seeing nice growth in uptake in psoriasis is TREMFYA. You're right, it's a competitive market space, but we\u2019re seeing some switches out of STELARA to TREMFYA, and then TREMFYA is picking up new scripts on its own for our psoriasis play.\nChris DelOrefice: And just for context, the share growth in Crohn's and STELARA was over 5 points quarter-over-quarter, so seeing great progress there. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the questions. Rob, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Two questions in medical device land. With the VELYS approval, can you sort of give us a date on how you're thinking about rolling that out, and whether or not those plans change in the current environment? And then, in Vision Care, there are a couple of different pushes and pulls going on, both in contact lenses as well as in vision surgery. Could you tease that out a little bit as we think about SKU rationalization versus competitive pressures?\nAlex Gorsky: Sure. And good to hear from you, Joanne. Joanne, regarding VELYS, look, we were very excited about the approval with the FDA. As we were able to share with you during our Innovation Day with our Medical Device group, if we look at the flexibility, the accuracy, the reduced footprint that it provides the surgeon and surgical teams, we think that it just has tremendous potential. Again, this is a market that is still -- we think has a significant opportunity for growth in terms of penetration. We also think it will be a nice complement to our ATTUNE fixed bearing cementless knee. And remember, we also have plans to expand VELYS significantly beyond just knee replacement but to other areas as well. So, when you combine that, we think it will be very competitive. And more importantly, we think it will be a great new option for physicians, for orthopedic surgeons and ultimately for patients and their families. I'm not going to get into all of the launch plans. But, what I will tell you is the team has got an aggressive agenda lined up, and they're completing all the other associated testing as we speak. But, we look forward to launching that over the course of 2021 and again, expanding our overall position. Regarding Vision Care, you're right. There are a lot of dynamics that we certainly saw in the past year, in the contact lens market, significant contraction as well as in the surgery market. We believe that our position overall in the contact lens has continued to strengthen. And we did see improvement as we went quarter-to-quarter and ended the year, and we think we'll be well-positioned as we enter 2021. We've also made a number of changes regarding our surgical business. We're excited in 2021 about the TECNIS Symfony launch with a depth of focus lens. It's got improved near-term focus. And we also have a TECNIS Synergy IOL, a first-in-class product, combining a number of different technologies, to really deliver a great range with high contrast. We expect that in '21. So, again, we remain very confident and optimistic about the potential overall in our Vision Care business.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Joanne, just a couple of small builds. In contact lens, as we have noted in prior quarter, if you remember, in the U.S., there was double-digit growth, and some of those were some of the retail dynamics as it related to inventory and stocking that you noted, adjusting for that contact lens did grow. It was worth almost 9 points. And we do view our growth is still competitive versus the market. And then, on the surgical side, it was actually good. We did see some recovery in the market there. So, it's good to see the trend. While we're still declining, it's improving sequentially, and we remain optimistic, including the innovation that Alex mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: So, just a couple of follow-ups on Med Devices. You've made some great progress in 2020, closing the gap on digital surgery and abdominal surgery, orthopedics and lung. And just curious, sort of following on to Joanne's question around the VELYS rollout is, how to think about this -- you get recovery in volumes generally in the market, in some of these end markets, and then, you've got sort of the benefit of these new digital surgery sort of launches. And is that -- do we see that in back half of the year? Do we start to see ortho this year and Ottava maybe the following year? If you could just maybe lay out the cadence for both the top line and any investments that those entail for Med Devices, that would be super helpful.\nAlex Gorsky: Sure, Matt. Thank you very much. Look, we were -- I think, it's important to put maybe perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our Medical Device division was about 1.5-point, and if you look at the expansion as we went through 2019 to where it was growing at almost a 4% rate. And as we've articulated a number of times, our goal is to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. We believe the markets where we compete overall in surgery and orthopedics and vision care and others, cardiovascular, are in the 4% to 5% range. And that's the goal for our businesses. As we -- of course, with 2019 -- or 2020, excuse me, and the effect of COVID, that had a very significant impact. But again, here too, if we normalize out our trends for third and fourth quarter, we think that overall, those quarters were pretty consistent, down about 3.5% after you pull everything else out, and will put us on a good rate, as we mentioned earlier, over the course of 2021 and beyond. Regarding VELYS, as I mentioned earlier, we think it does offer a number of unique advantages. We think it can enhance the surgeon's ability to really personalize total knee arthroscopy. At the same time, it has certain features that will make it easier for use potentially in the operating room. And again, we think it's going to be a great complement to not only our ATTUNE system, but further down the line to our hip procedures and others as well. We do feel that the overall knee market will recover in 2021. It will take place over the course of the year as hospitals are able to continue to get their capacity back, as patients get increasingly confident. The knee market was perhaps hit more than others just because many of those procedures can be delayed, perhaps versus a hip procedure. But, we would expect that to return over the course of this year as we see the pandemic dealt with in a more effective way and things hopefully return to a more normal state. And by the way, we think the outlook for that longer term, given some of the pent-up demand that we're likely to see, will be quite significant. As you saw in our review back in November, we're very excited about Ottava. We truly think it's going to offer a next-generation digital and robotic surgery. As you just mentioned, the team made great progress over the last 12 months. As we brought the various technologies together, we continue to do the build-outs and when -- we remain on track with all the time lines that we have previously committed to. And we're confident that here too is a market that we think is very -- has very low penetration, less than 5% or 10%, certainly on a global basis, more so in certain categories here in the United States. But, whether it's penetration or the ability just to expand those kind of options to surgeons here in the United States around the world, based upon the technology that we'll be bringing, we think it will offer significant upside on the time lines that you just mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: I just have a quick COVID question. And I'm sorry if I missed this, Alex. I feel like you did allude to the in response to Matt's question. But, over the last two quarters, you had given pretty detailed numbers around the COVID impact. Is there any way you could give that for this quarter, just to get a sense of sort of what the normalized growth rate actually would have been, were it not for the COVID resurgence? Thanks so much.\nAlex Gorsky: Yes. Thanks, Danielle. I can take that one. Yes, we were able to do that in Q1 because there was an early impact. And then, what we did was as we provided guidance throughout the year, we kind of gave you a range of expected impact by quarter, based on what our original guidance would have been at the beginning of the year. If you look at what we shared in Q4 ahead of this earnings, we'd anticipated that we could be anywhere from down 10% or flat versus our original thinking, which would have contemplated some growth year-over-year, plus a 53rd week. If you look at where we landed, we basically landed at the low end of that range, given some of the additional softness that the market experienced in the December timeframe where procedures were probably down more around that 10% range. So, overall, in line with expectations, but more towards the low end, given some of the surge we saw at the very end.\nOperator: The last question will be coming from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Thank you very much. Just one quick one. I appreciate the comment that globally in Q4, Medical Device revenue declines were really no worse than Q3 when you adjust out the onetimers. That's pretty impressive given the headlines. I was wondering if you could give us a sense to what happened to device growth, maybe in the United States in Q4 relative to Q3, again net of those onetimers. And also on the U.S., if we think about 2021, is it too aggressive to assume that in the back half of 2021, based on everything you're seeing today that we might be able to approach normal levels of surgical procedure volumes in the United States? I appreciate the comments. Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey Bob. Thank you very much. What we saw in North America in Q4 was it down just about -- or excuse me, up about 2%. And again, there were regions around the country where we saw a differential impact. But, I think it's fair to say that we were pleased to see the ability of the majority of systems in the United States being able to continue to provide elective procedures, even in spite of some of the later surges where we saw even more significant impacts were in Europe and LatAm during that period. And because of our stronger position in certain places in Europe that had a differential impact on us. And again, as hopefully, we see improving trends with the virus in Europe over the course of 2021, we would expect to see that return. And so, regarding your questions on volumes in the back end, look, it's hard to predict based upon where we currently are. As we said earlier, we think the most significant impact this year will be certainly in Q1. As we continue to deal with some of the ongoing surge, we would expect the year-on-year comparisons to change pretty significantly in Q2 and Q3. And again, assuming much improved vaccine distribution, better overall control of COVID-19, we would then expect to see volumes come back to more normalized levels as we finish the year. But obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of assumptions, a lot of dynamics that we'll have to watch closely. But, our current plans would take those kind of projections into consideration.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Thanks everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Apologies to those who we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team, as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex for some brief closing remarks.\nAlex Gorsky: Well, thank you everyone for your comments, for your questions and for your ongoing interest, trust and confidence in Johnson & Johnson. It's likely an overused term at this point, but 2020 was a remarkable year on just so many different fronts. And I want to again end where I started by acknowledging the tremendous toll that this has taken on patients, on families, on the hospital systems around the world, but also give credit to health care systems and our employees who\u2019ve worked so hard to continue to support the same, through this challenging period. We're proud of our performance. We think we're positioned very well as we embark on 2021, and we look forward to keeping you updated as we go through the year and gain more information and insights. Thank you very much, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Alex Gorsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. And thank you everyone for taking time to join us today to discuss our full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. At the start of last year, no one could have imagined just how drastically our lives were about to change because of a virus that would impact billions of people around the world. By any measure, 2020 was a year dominated by uncertainty, yet the pandemic also helped to clarify both our priorities and our values. And within Johnson & Johnson, it has illustrated the power and importance of our credo in guiding our actions to meet the needs of all our stakeholders. Now because of COVID-19, we now have a deeper appreciation on just how pivotal good health is to our safety, security, and prosperity as a society. We have a profound respect and gratitude for all the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff serving on the frontlines of care, for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up every day to keep the world's critical infrastructure up and running, and expectations that companies can and should help drive positive change in the society are higher than ever. As the world's largest and most broadly based global health care company, Johnson & Johnson was built for times like these. We've been leading through the world's biggest public health challenges for over a century. And today, our diversified businesses touch so many parts of people's lives. We had both the ability and the responsibility to act when the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a global pandemic. Within weeks of the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus, Janssen scientists were working 24/7 to identify the most promising lead candidate for a vaccine. I'm proud of the progress of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and the fact that we moved so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of our vaccine and supply chain teams. We look forward to sharing further details from our Phase 3 study by early next week. Additionally, I'm just as proud of the ways that each of my Johnson & Johnson colleagues have gone above and beyond the call of duty to provide uninterrupted access to our medicines, embrace radically new ways of working, and use the full breadth and depth of our expertise to deliver our important medicines and products to patients and consumers and support health care systems that have been overwhelmed by the pandemic. The fact that we've been able not just to weather this crisis but bring our broad-based capabilities to support this crisis and deliver on a shorter term top and bottom line business goals, while increasing our investments in innovation at record levels is a remarkable testament to our purpose-driven culture and the core strengths that characterize our Company for over a century; execution, innovation, and people. Our relentless focus on excellence and execution is key to meeting the needs of all our stakeholders today and tomorrow. The performance of our business in 2020 reflects the continued confidence from patients, physicians, customers, and consumers in our life-saving medicines and products. Our Pharmaceutical business performed well above market, kept pipeline submissions and approvals on track, and exceeded patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. Our Consumer Health business also performed above market for the year, and our Medical Devices business demonstrated resiliency and agility leading to a strong second half recovery. Our unparalleled scientific expertise allowed us to create life-enhancing innovation. Our R&D colleagues across Johnson & Johnson have continued to advance our robust pipeline of innovative and transformational new products. Of note, we initiated our U.S. filing for our BCMA Car-T in multiple myeloma in December. In addition, we filed amivantamab for the treatment of Exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Europe. Our Medical Devices business has made strong progress advancing our pipeline, despite the pandemic, achieving and even accelerating certain key milestones throughout the year. As you heard from Ashley, Dr. Moll and the team at the Medical Devices Update in November, we are developing an end-to-end digital ecosystem across three robotics platforms, and we achieved a significant milestone this month receiving FDA clearance for our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We believe the industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of robotic and digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned to bring innovative, differentiated solutions to the surgery suite over the next 10, 20, and 30 years. I'm also very proud of the great work from our supply chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner even honored Johnson & Johnson with a number 3 ranking across all industries on its Annual 2020 Supply Chain Top 25 Index. That's up five spots from our 2019 ranking. Gartner also awarded Johnson & Johnson the number one spot on its 2020 Health care Supply Chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And finally, we are powered by our people, purpose, and value system. More than 75 years since it was authored, our credo continues to guide all 135,000 of us at Johnson & Johnson. So, with that in mind, I want to highlight a recent appointment to our Board of Directors, an incredibly high honor awarded to one of our own directors. In December, Johnson & Johnson appointed retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General and former U.S. Army Surgeon General, Dr. Nadja West to our Board of Directors. Dr. West's accomplished healthcare background in addition to her deep strategic leadership experience are strong additions to our Board of Directors. In October, Johnson & Johnson's Board Director, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, along with her colleague, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the revolutionary discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, considered to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in molecular biology in the past decade. We are truly proud of her recognition for this incredible work. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in both, our workforce and the communities at which we serve has always been an important part of our culture. However, the past year has also shown a spotlight on the fact that we can all do more. To that end, I am proud of our Race to Health Equity platform launched in November. Our Race to Health Equity aims to help improve racial equity by eliminating health inequities for people of color and our $100 million commitment to invest in and promote health equity. I'm excited to be part of this progress and for Johnson & Johnson to play a part in impactful, lasting change. And most importantly, the talented and committed people at Johnson & Johnson drive our success by putting the patients and consumers we serve around the world at the forefront of all we do. We think and rely on them to continue to innovate, execute and focus on our shared purpose to deliver better health for everyone everywhere. I look forward to addressing your questions during the Q&A portion of the webcast. Right now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to share details related to our performance for the quarter. Thank you. Chris? Hey Terence, this is Alex. Thank you very much for your question. Look, maybe before I answer this -- your question, let me just back up for a higher level, and once again, note, what I think has just been the tremendous contributions and performance of our 150,000 approximate associates around the world, 50,000 of whom have been going to work every day in our factories and our laboratories to ensure the products and services could continue to flow to patients and hospital systems around the world, let alone the important work that we're doing on the vaccine. Next, I also just think it's very important to reflect on the tremendous impact that COVID-19 has had around the world. You've heard some of the numbers that we mentioned earlier today, whether it's almost 100 million cases around the world, let alone 2 million deaths globally or right here in the United States, almost 25 million people and over 400,000 deaths, that's taken a tremendous cost on certainly families, individuals, businesses, our economy on just so many different aspects of our life that all the more important for us to be doing everything we can to make a difference during this pandemic. Last but not least, I'm just very proud of the performance that we had, not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2020. If you look at the various segments, in almost each of our sectors, all of our major platforms, what you saw is us ending the year in a better position than where we started. And that wasn't only for what I would call the near-term financial performance where we saw things like market share gains and position improvements, but also if you look at the investment that we made in research and development, in sales and marketing preparing for the future not only 2021, but that and beyond, again we think we're well-positioned and stronger as we finished the year than even when we began. Now, getting back to your specific question regarding the breakouts, we're going to have much more information in the coming days. We think it's very important to follow the data, to follow the science. At that time, we think it will be more appropriate to provide you with all of the various cuts of the data that we anticipate having. Consistent with the statements that we made from the very beginning, we want to ensure that we've got a very robust program not only geographically, but also by ethnicity, gender, as well as a number of other different parameters, all as part of an effort to give us the best possible understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine, so stay tuned. As Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, and Chris we expect to have these results in the coming days. And our scientists, Dr. Mathai Mammen, Dr. Paul Stoffels, and others will be providing much more detail once we have those results. Hey Larry, thank you very much for your question. As I mentioned earlier, I think it would be inappropriate for us to speculate in any significant way, given the proximity that we are today versus when we expect the results. What we said from the very beginning is that we put a lot of work and thought and very strong science and review into the selection of our lead candidate. I think, the Phase 1 and 2a results, particularly those that were recently published, we are hopeful that's a good precursor to the kind of efficacy and safety that we'll see in larger population, of course, until we see this final data. We won't know for certain, but look we remain optimistic, and we're going to remain very diligent as we go through this final review. I'll hand it over to Joe to take the second part of that question. Hey David, this is Alex. I'll take the first part and then let Joe take the second one. Look, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to pull together all of our data. We're enrolling, as we speak, in the dual dose information. We would expect that -- to have that in the back end of this year. And again, as we -- just as we try to be very transparent and very thorough in the disclosure that we're releasing, we certainly will plan to follow that course with that trial as well. And again, we'll get out information as soon as we can. Regarding some of the variants, obviously, we're watching that closely, based upon some of the regional, the geographical differences that we've seen. And look, our scientists are already anticipating, as you heard from some of the other companies, about what are potential scenarios to ensure that we're prepared. But look, I think, it starts with taking a look at the data that we currently have that we should have shortly. And I think Dr. Paul Stoffels and Dr. Mathai Mammen, once we have that, will be able to give a much more comprehensive review on exactly how we think our vaccine will work against the current strains and variants and our plans for the future. Joe? Hey Louise, Alex. Thanks again for your question. Regarding durability, again, we're going to have to see how some of the early data in some of the preclinical work that we have done plays out in the actual large-scale trials. We're certainly hopeful that you're going to see a durable and a sustainable and patent response, particularly from our vector approach. We have seen that in other programs that we run. So, we're hopeful that we'll see it here, but we would expect that to play out. We are pleased with not only the antibody response that we saw but also some of the cellular level response that would be in T cells. But again, more information will be available once we have our other final results. Secondly, more broadly, about health care, I do think that -- and we do feel that COVID-19 has had a very profound effect on health care systems, both near term and short -- and longer term. I think, in the near term, what we've learned is frankly the importance of innovation and science. And if you reflect back on where we were, just 11 or 12 months ago at the beginning of COVID-19 and where we are now in the number, not only of very innovative vaccine candidates, but therapeutics and the differences that they made. If you take a look at the way hospital protocols very rapidly and quickly started to using data sciences and information to better understand what was going on with patients entering those facilities, how they should be treated, what led to better outcomes, how that's impacted the reduction in morbidity, I think clearly, another example. Third, we've seen a rapid expansion in telehealth, and that's in primary care offices but also specialty offices. The way that companies like ours actually communicate and engage and educate physicians and health care systems, we would see that lasting for some time as well. And clearly, on the public health side, we think that's also a very important dynamic for us to consider going forward. I mean, I think it's clear from this that the world now has a much better understanding of the importance of well-established, well-funded global public health programs, without which we're at significant risk around the world, whether it's our economies, society, just at a number of different levels. So, those are perhaps some of the longer term trends. And last but not least, I'd like to do a -- just a shout out for the partnership and collaboration that we've seen with not only within industry and across industry but also with regulators around the world. And it's certainly our hope that we can take some of that and apply it to other advancements, whether it's cures for cancer, neuroscience, other conditions. If we can take some of those same paradigms and accelerations and apply them there, that would be great news, not only for patients, certainly in health care systems, but for the industry as well. Hey Louise, I might just add one other point and that is, we actually look forward to working with the new administration on issues related to health care. Clearly, the pandemic we feel will shape the perspective in terms of the prioritization around access, around innovation, and frankly, using this as an opportunity to improve the overall health care system. Chris, look, overall, we remain very confident in the long-term prospects around the medical device market. And I think we saw very good signs of that actually over the course of 2020, where we saw the medical device market drop anywhere from 30% to up to 70%, depending on which category you're looking at, to return to mid-single-digit drops in the third quarter as we went through the rest of the year. As Joe and I believe Chris alluded to earlier in some of their commentary, we would expect see continued impact certainly in the first quarter of 2021, although the early signs, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in hospitals' ability to manage through some of the current patient demands. There are certainly regions and hospitals around the world, let alone in the United States, where you see a tremendous strain on the systems. But overall, we're seeing hospital volumes decrease no more than about 10% or 15% in areas such, for example, in the UK, a couple of other places in Europe. But overall, the resiliency and the ability of the hospital systems that continue with elective surgeries has improved quite significantly. And as you -- as I'm sure you would project, if we look at second quarter, in particular, the year-on-year comparison should return. As we look at our team's performance and consider 2021, we're actually looking at 2019 as more of a benchmark to -- and to use that as an indicator more of what a baseline or normal would be. But again, we can -- we would expect to continue to see expansion over the course of 2021. And beyond that again see a return to a market that was growing in the mid-single-digits previously, and we would expect that to continue going forward as well. Yes. Regarding STELARA, look, we remain very upbeat on the overall performance of STELARA. I mean, if you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, it was about 30% growth for the full year. We are looking at 20% growth. And what's really important to remember about STELARA is just the diversity of indications now that we have with that compound, especially in GI conditions, where we think it's particularly differentiated and unique, both in terms of its efficacy and now a very robust safety profile as well, based upon the years of experience. It is a competitive category. There are a number of new agents. But we also know that this is an area of significant unmet medical need, again, particularly in the Crohn's space and the rest of the GI category. And so, we think there remains really good opportunity for us to continue to not only maintain but grow our position. Sure. And good to hear from you, Joanne. Joanne, regarding VELYS, look, we were very excited about the approval with the FDA. As we were able to share with you during our Innovation Day with our Medical Device group, if we look at the flexibility, the accuracy, the reduced footprint that it provides the surgeon and surgical teams, we think that it just has tremendous potential. Again, this is a market that is still -- we think has a significant opportunity for growth in terms of penetration. We also think it will be a nice complement to our ATTUNE fixed bearing cementless knee. And remember, we also have plans to expand VELYS significantly beyond just knee replacement but to other areas as well. So, when you combine that, we think it will be very competitive. And more importantly, we think it will be a great new option for physicians, for orthopedic surgeons and ultimately for patients and their families. I'm not going to get into all of the launch plans. But, what I will tell you is the team has got an aggressive agenda lined up, and they're completing all the other associated testing as we speak. But, we look forward to launching that over the course of 2021 and again, expanding our overall position. Regarding Vision Care, you're right. There are a lot of dynamics that we certainly saw in the past year, in the contact lens market, significant contraction as well as in the surgery market. We believe that our position overall in the contact lens has continued to strengthen. And we did see improvement as we went quarter-to-quarter and ended the year, and we think we'll be well-positioned as we enter 2021. We've also made a number of changes regarding our surgical business. We're excited in 2021 about the TECNIS Symfony launch with a depth of focus lens. It's got improved near-term focus. And we also have a TECNIS Synergy IOL, a first-in-class product, combining a number of different technologies, to really deliver a great range with high contrast. We expect that in '21. So, again, we remain very confident and optimistic about the potential overall in our Vision Care business. Sure, Matt. Thank you very much. Look, we were -- I think, it's important to put maybe perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our Medical Device division was about 1.5-point, and if you look at the expansion as we went through 2019 to where it was growing at almost a 4% rate. And as we've articulated a number of times, our goal is to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. We believe the markets where we compete overall in surgery and orthopedics and vision care and others, cardiovascular, are in the 4% to 5% range. And that's the goal for our businesses. As we -- of course, with 2019 -- or 2020, excuse me, and the effect of COVID, that had a very significant impact. But again, here too, if we normalize out our trends for third and fourth quarter, we think that overall, those quarters were pretty consistent, down about 3.5% after you pull everything else out, and will put us on a good rate, as we mentioned earlier, over the course of 2021 and beyond. Regarding VELYS, as I mentioned earlier, we think it does offer a number of unique advantages. We think it can enhance the surgeon's ability to really personalize total knee arthroscopy. At the same time, it has certain features that will make it easier for use potentially in the operating room. And again, we think it's going to be a great complement to not only our ATTUNE system, but further down the line to our hip procedures and others as well. We do feel that the overall knee market will recover in 2021. It will take place over the course of the year as hospitals are able to continue to get their capacity back, as patients get increasingly confident. The knee market was perhaps hit more than others just because many of those procedures can be delayed, perhaps versus a hip procedure. But, we would expect that to return over the course of this year as we see the pandemic dealt with in a more effective way and things hopefully return to a more normal state. And by the way, we think the outlook for that longer term, given some of the pent-up demand that we're likely to see, will be quite significant. As you saw in our review back in November, we're very excited about Ottava. We truly think it's going to offer a next-generation digital and robotic surgery. As you just mentioned, the team made great progress over the last 12 months. As we brought the various technologies together, we continue to do the build-outs and when -- we remain on track with all the time lines that we have previously committed to. And we're confident that here too is a market that we think is very -- has very low penetration, less than 5% or 10%, certainly on a global basis, more so in certain categories here in the United States. But, whether it's penetration or the ability just to expand those kind of options to surgeons here in the United States around the world, based upon the technology that we'll be bringing, we think it will offer significant upside on the time lines that you just mentioned. Yes. Thanks, Danielle. I can take that one. Yes, we were able to do that in Q1 because there was an early impact. And then, what we did was as we provided guidance throughout the year, we kind of gave you a range of expected impact by quarter, based on what our original guidance would have been at the beginning of the year. If you look at what we shared in Q4 ahead of this earnings, we'd anticipated that we could be anywhere from down 10% or flat versus our original thinking, which would have contemplated some growth year-over-year, plus a 53rd week. If you look at where we landed, we basically landed at the low end of that range, given some of the additional softness that the market experienced in the December timeframe where procedures were probably down more around that 10% range. So, overall, in line with expectations, but more towards the low end, given some of the surge we saw at the very end. Hey Bob. Thank you very much. What we saw in North America in Q4 was it down just about -- or excuse me, up about 2%. And again, there were regions around the country where we saw a differential impact. But, I think it's fair to say that we were pleased to see the ability of the majority of systems in the United States being able to continue to provide elective procedures, even in spite of some of the later surges where we saw even more significant impacts were in Europe and LatAm during that period. And because of our stronger position in certain places in Europe that had a differential impact on us. And again, as hopefully, we see improving trends with the virus in Europe over the course of 2021, we would expect to see that return. And so, regarding your questions on volumes in the back end, look, it's hard to predict based upon where we currently are. As we said earlier, we think the most significant impact this year will be certainly in Q1. As we continue to deal with some of the ongoing surge, we would expect the year-on-year comparisons to change pretty significantly in Q2 and Q3. And again, assuming much improved vaccine distribution, better overall control of COVID-19, we would then expect to see volumes come back to more normalized levels as we finish the year. But obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of assumptions, a lot of dynamics that we'll have to watch closely. But, our current plans would take those kind of projections into consideration. Well, thank you everyone for your comments, for your questions and for your ongoing interest, trust and confidence in Johnson & Johnson. It's likely an overused term at this point, but 2020 was a remarkable year on just so many different fronts. And I want to again end where I started by acknowledging the tremendous toll that this has taken on patients, on families, on the hospital systems around the world, but also give credit to health care systems and our employees who've worked so hard to continue to support the same, through this challenging period. We're proud of our performance. We think we're positioned very well as we embark on 2021, and we look forward to keeping you updated as we go through the year and gain more information and insights. Thank you very much, everybody."

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation, despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwavering commitment of our 135,000 global colleagues was on full display, delivering trusted, life-saving, life-enhancing products to patients and consumers around the world. Their efforts resulted in sound shareholder returns while advancing value-creating opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders now and over the long term. Alex stated on this call and really throughout 2020 that Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. Our disciplined, long-term focus yields a financial strength that affords us the ability to quickly act to address the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, most notably on our ongoing vaccine development, but to also continue investing in innovative solutions to better the future of health care even when short-term uncertainty exists. I am very pleased today to share our financial guidance for 2021, which reflects these principles. But, first, let me review our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of $20 billion, surpassing last year's record high. We did benefit by having our fiscal year-end lapse into 2021, as Chris noted, and we are now planning for a payment related to the anticipated final opioid litigation agreement in principal in 2021 versus the previous planned 2020 payment. In terms of our cash position at the end of 2020, we had approximately $10 billion of net debt, comprised of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. One element of our business that we're particularly proud of that despite the challenges of 2020 offered, we maintained our long-term approach to drive growth and value creation across the enterprise. From an innovation standpoint, the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a top priority throughout the year. Yet, as I said earlier, we continued to make other strategic investments that fortified our pipeline and further enhanced our competitive advantage even during the pandemic. Our level of R&D investment reached an all-time high of $12.1 billion, $800 million more than our 2019 R&D investment. On the transaction front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that strategically complement our portfolio and where our scientific expertise or commercial capabilities can create unique value. Over the course of 2020, we invested over $7 billion in such opportunities. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October, we acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals and a lead therapeutic candidate, nipocalimab, which is in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of rare autoantibody-driven diseases. We believe nipocalimab encompasses a pipeline and a product opportunity that can treat a broad range of devastating autoantibody-driven diseases. In December, we expanded our retina pipeline by acquiring the rights to Hemera Biosciences investigational gene therapy, HMR59, a onetime outpatient intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a severe form of age-related macular degeneration, where currently, there are no other approved therapies. And as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson have come to expect, we continue to prioritize our dividend by announcing last April a 6.3% increase. This translated in returning $10.5 billion to investors in 2020, approximately 50% of our free cash flow. Let's now turn to our full year 2021 guidance. Given our full year 2020 performance in this unprecedented environment and the underlying strength of our broad-based business, we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor and work with health care systems around the globe as they balance surges in COVID-19 cases with treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the tremendous efforts of health care providers around the world that have society in a much better place today with improved treatment protocols and resource allocation compared to the start of the pandemic. We are also encouraged by the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines that will provide added reassurance to people in need of medical procedures. From a macroeconomic perspective, our outlook assumes stabilizing employment levels and a reduction in social restrictions as the year progresses. From a legislative standpoint, we are not assuming significant changes in current tax policy, and consistent with the past four years in our Pharmaceuticals business, we expect net price decreases at similar levels. We will continue to focus on providing access to more patients for our innovative products, resulting in growth being volume-driven. So, let's get into the details for full year 2021 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. I'd like to note upfront that our guidance excludes the financial impact from the potential distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. As Alex noted, we remain committed to provide a safe and effective vaccine. Being in the final stages of a robust 45,000-person study, analytics will be completed, and we plan to report out the results by early next week. Therefore, it would be premature to speculate. We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates, as warranted, likely during our first quarter earnings call in April. Starting with sales. We expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2021 of between 8.0% and 9.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points and as such are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 7.5% to 9.0%, or $88.8 billion to $90.0 billion. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movement. But for some context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.21, there is an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 9.5% and 11.0% or 10.3% at the midpoint compared to 2020 or $90.5 billion to $91.7 billion. Let's now turn to earnings per share. This slide illustrates the components of our 2021 EPS guidance. Roughly half of our EPS growth is attributed to the robust operational sales growth and the other half is attributable to strong net income margin improvement, driven by expected operating margin improvement of more than 200 basis points versus 2020. The medical device COVID-19 recovery and other cost improvement initiatives are planned to more than offset our continued investment to accelerate our business and further strengthen our pipeline of new products for the long term. As a reminder, included in our 2021 guidance is the dilution from the recent acquisition of Momenta, negatively impacting EPS by about $0.15 or $0.10 versus 2020. Considering these items, results in adjusted operational EPS in a range of $9.25 to $9.45 or $9.35 at the midpoint, reflecting a 16.4% year-over-year increase. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 18.3% versus the prior year. Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of what I just shared along with some additional P&L items, to give you more insight into the drivers of our full year guidance. Beginning with other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, litigation and write-offs. As I discussed on previous earnings calls, we will continue to be rigorous regarding portfolio management, but going forward, we will not include the impact of significant divestiture gains in adjusted EPS. Given those considerations, we would be comfortable with your models for 2021, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from between $600 million and $700 million. We continue to actively evaluate external value-creating opportunities, but for purposes of your financial models, we are not assuming any major acquisitions or other major uses of cash at this time. Therefore, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2021 in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% or a midpoint of 17% due to beneficial onetime items in 2020 related to the closeout of audits in several jurisdictions that will not repeat in 2021. Let me spend a few minutes providing some qualitative context about 2021, although not intended to specifically provide segment or quarterly guidance. Given variability that occurred due primarily to COVID-related dynamics, this slide, while not to scale and meant to be illustrative, offers some perspectives on the quarterly phasing across our businesses. From a sales perspective, as Chris noted earlier, we benefited from additional selling days in 2020 that will not repeat in 2021. That should be applied to both, the full year and the fourth quarter for the enterprise and by segment. I'll address each segment starting with Pharmaceuticals, where we anticipate another strong year of above-market growth. Throughout 2020, we saw COVID-19-driven fluctuations, and most pronounced was the first quarter when, as we noted, we benefited from longer script durations. We continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccine development, impacting the first quarter while we pursue authorization. For 2021, we expect more balanced quarter-to-quarter growth. Lastly, while we expect to continue to face pricing pressures and the ongoing negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, we do not expect any significant new generic or biosimilar entrants in 2021. Turning to our Medical Device segment. As mentioned earlier, we observed instances of nonemergency procedure postponements late in the fourth quarter, but health care systems continue to meet the needs of both, COVID and non-COVID patients, resulting in less COVID-19 market disruption as we progressed through 2020. While macro market dynamics such as vaccine deployment, unemployment and health care coverage remain fluid, we are anticipating some moderate procedural disruption to carry into the first quarter but expect continued medical device market improvement throughout 2021 fluctuating by quarter. As you heard during our Medical Device update in November, our core platforms continue to strengthen, driven by enhanced execution and improved cadence of innovation and filling critical portfolio gaps, including and most notably, advancing our future digital surgery offerings. We believe the combination of the expected market recovery and the actions taken to strengthen our device business positions us to drive revenue growth each quarter versus 2020 with some continued headwinds due to COVID-19 tempering growth in the first quarter and the highest growth rate expected in the second quarter, given the significant market disruption realized in the second quarter of 2020. Our Consumer Health segment yielded solid performance throughout the pandemic, resulting in above-market growth. But as noted on our third quarter earnings call, that performance is likely to yield negative COVID-related sales comparisons in the first quarter of 2021, primarily in over-the-counter products. We also plan that our continued SKU rationalization program will have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2021 while we continue progressing our margin expansion. For the second half, we would anticipate more normalized growth as consumers return to more typical usage patterns for products in areas like Skin Health and Beauty. Therefore, although not linear, for the full year, we anticipate growing competitively with the markets in which we compete. We are confident in the strength of our broad-based business and its underlying fundamentals. We are positioned to deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders, not just in 2021, but over the long term. Alex and I look forward to addressing your questions. So, I'm now pleased to turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A session. Chris? Sure. Good morning, Larry. And thanks for the question. I would say with respect to supply, consistent with the comments that were made earlier, we intend to meet all of the firm order commitments that we have, whether that be to the United States, to the European Union or to developing countries through the Gavi organization. And right now, we're well on track to do that. As Alex alluded to, there is still some fluidity with respect to timelines. And I think what we're seeing happening with a little bit of confusion is people are trying to parse this down into weeks. I think, the definitive statement here is that we are very comfortable in meeting our commitments to those respective countries or organizations that I just outlined. In terms of financial implications and pricing, as you can imagine once countries get a chance to see the data, we're in active negotiations for other countries and other organizations, and the volume will impact the selling price. So, it's somewhat of a fluid situation, and that's why we're kind of projecting or leading folks to think about the April first quarter earnings call as a good time when many of those pieces will be in place, and we can give you some credible information to bank on for the balance of 2021. Good morning, David. With respect to kind of the earnings outlook and specifically, the operating margins, you're correct. And not to get cute, but the words were actually greater than 200 basis points. So, that could gravitate upward. We certainly want to keep the flexibility that we've had even during 2021 and all that uncertainty to continue to invest in innovative ideas that really fortify, not just this year, but well beyond. In terms of some of the programs we have that are improving our operating margins, I'd point you to this consumer SKU rationalization. That is certainly something that will have an impact on consumer sales in the first half of the year, but again, with this objective of improving profit margins, and that team has done a great job under Thibaut's leadership with respect to improving the margin profile over the last two years. You may also recall a few years back made significant investments in our supply chain infrastructure. Some of those are starting to pay off in 2021 as well. And then, like it or not, we are working differently, and there are efficiencies that correlate to some of this working differently. I'm not suggesting that we found a steady state in terms of the balance between virtual work and work in the office, but there are some efficiencies that are being realized that I think will actually sustain long term as we move forward. So, those are some of the factors that are going into our bullish call of above 200 basis points margin improvement. Hey Louise, maybe just one other comment to build upon Alex's commentary is that you've referenced towards the end of your question about the new administration and what kind of policies they may have around health care. What I would say is we've been around for 135 years. It's I think 24 different administrations from both, Republican and Democrat. We're going to continue to do what we do best, and that's to innovate. And if I look at our pharmaceutical portfolio, the great performance that they delivered in 2020 was once again met with, for the fourth consecutive year, price decreases overall in the portfolio. So, we're seeing the benefit of innovation, whether it be for the COVID-19 vaccine or other solutions in immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and neuroscience. And so, that's what we're going to be focused on. And by the way, Louise, I just got a comment. You did a really nice job on the news program this morning. That was outstanding work by you. And Chris, if you look at where the growth is coming from for STELARA in recent quarters, it has been in the GI indications that Alex has noted where we're really seeing nice growth in uptake in psoriasis is TREMFYA. You're right, it's a competitive market space, but we're seeing some switches out of STELARA to TREMFYA, and then TREMFYA is picking up new scripts on its own for our psoriasis play."

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. \nChris DelOrefice : Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the third quarter of 2020. I hope everyone is healthy and continues to remain safe during these times. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will be joined by Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Consumer Health; and Mathai Mammen, Global Head of Janssen Research & Development.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K, and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.  Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  Moving to today's agenda. I will cover consolidated and segment sales information, along with some operational highlights from the P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. My comments on the segments will be shared at a high-level to allow more time for Q&A. Joe will provide high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including J&J's response to COVID-19 followed by insights into our capital allocation priorities as well as some key pipeline updates. He will then conclude with our 2020 guidance, and qualitative expectations as we\u2019re positioned for a strong start to 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes.  Worldwide sales were $21.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020, reflecting a reported growth of 1.7% versus the third quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, also increased 1.7% as currency had no impact in the quarter. In the U.S., sales increased 2.7%; while in regions outside the U.S., our reported and operational increase was 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales increase was 2% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S., and 1.1% outside the U.S. Results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we did see improvement throughout the quarter with procedure volume recovering faster than expected as well as positive trends in scripts and physician office visits.  Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.66 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.20, representing increases of 3.5% and 3.8% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 2.4%.  Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the third quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2019, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.  Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and grew 3% with growth in the U.S. of 11.6% and a decline outside the U.S. of 2.7%. Consumer Health delivered strong performance in our U.S. OTC, oral care, and wound care businesses, partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 outside the U.S. primarily in our OTC, and skin health/beauty businesses. We're making good progress executing our SKU rationalization program, which as expected, negatively impacted sales results in mostly OUS markets. However, this was mostly offset by some sales related true-ups in Latin America. Additionally, e-commerce sales continue to drive growth across most brands. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally by 4% on strong U.S. sales of TYLENOL in analgesics due to share growth and increased demand driven by COVID-19, PEPCID in digestive health due to a competitive withdrawal, and ZYRTEC in allergy due to the share gains, incremental distribution, and strong in-season marketing plans. Growth was also driven by increased retailer stocking across multiple brands in preparation for a potential upcoming cold and flu season. This strong performance was partially offset outside the U.S. by the impact of COVID-19 consumption declines in China in pain, and in cough, cold, and digestive health in other regions.  Our OTC business is growing above the market gaining 0.7 points of share on a year-to-date basis. The skin health/beauty franchise returned to growth of 0.9% on strong performance of OGX due to share gains coupled with increased retailer stocking across multiple brands and a reduction in sun care returns due to a rebound in category growth. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. and the negative impact of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific and Latin America. As consumers continued to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, oral care grew by 10.8% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new product launches in Asia Pacific and increased demand globally related to COVID-19. Wound care grew 13.5%, primarily due to strong sales of BAND-AID Brand Adhesive Bandages, and NEOSPORIN. Moving on to the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $11.4 billion grew 4.6% enabled by growth across all regions. The business realized double-digit growth in seven key products with oncology as the main catalyst. Sales grew in the U.S. by 1.5% and outside the U.S. by 8.8%. Our growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19, driven by continued delays in diagnosis and slower new patient starts. The products most impacted were STELARA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA, and our pulmonary hypertension portfolio. The estimated impact of these products was worth roughly 200 basis points on worldwide pharmaceuticals growth in the quarter, which was an improvement from Q2 as office visit and script trends continue to improve. Year-to-date global operational growth was strong at roughly 6%, which remains above expected market growth for 2020. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 12.4%. DARZALEX continued to show momentum in all regions growing 43.4% led by share uptake in lines 1 and 2, with U.S. line 1 share up 2 points versus the prior year. Additionally, the U.S. and European markets exhibited increasing adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation, especially during this pandemic period. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the U.S. filing for amyloidosis. IMBRUVICA grew 11.2% globally driven largely by increased penetration and share gains in Europe. U.S. saw a strong underlying double-digit growth and continued leadership and share growth in CLL line 1, up 1.9 points. U.S. growth was negatively impacted by two comparisons to the prior year, a one-time returns reserve adjustment and higher inventory levels in 2019. On a global basis, these adjustments were worth over 500 basis points. ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum contributing just over $200 million in the quarter with sales more than doubling versus prior year with strong share growth, especially in the metastatic indication. Slightly offsetting these results were declines in ZYTIGA and VELCADE, primarily due to generic competition.  Moving now to immunology, globally sales grew 1.9% in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in STELARA and TREMFYA partially offset by continued erosion in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. Internationally, sales grew at 8.4% offsetting a slight decline in the U.S. of under 1%. Third quarter growth for our immunology portfolio as well as the overall market was impacted by COVID-19 related delayed diagnosis. Year-to-date, immunology growth was 5.7%. STELARA growth of 14% was driven by continued global uptake and share gains in Crohn's Disease, with about a 5 point share increase in the U.S. and growth from the recently approved ulcerative colitis indication, despite the negative impacts to the immunology market created by COVID-19. On a year-to-date basis, STELARA growth remained strong at about 18% globally.  TREMFYA, the first-in-class market leading IL-23 inhibitor grew 12.2% in the quarter, driven by growth of roughly 50% outside the U.S., due to continued strength of new launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales were flat in the quarter. U.S. delivered strong share gains, up nearly 3 points. However, growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 along with an unfavorable prior period pricing adjustment and further investments in rebates offered to enhance access. On a year-to-date basis, global growth for TREMFYA remained strong at 30.3%. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio posted double-digit growth of 13.9% driven by strong growth of OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI of 12.3% and 23.2% respectively, driven by increased market penetration and share growth. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.2 billion declining 3.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 3.3% worldwide. The medical device market continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Q3 but procedures began to resume more widely across the globe and we\u2019re reporting significant improvement in sales versus the 32.5% adjusted operational decline in Q2 and 20.1% decline in June. There was some variability by platform and across markets, but overall, we saw more stable results in total across each month this quarter with September declining in line with the total quarter declines of 3.3%. The sequential improvement compared to Q2 occurred across all segments of our business with the recovery occurring the quickest in the U.S. and China, two of our largest geographies. The U.S. returned to growth in the quarter. China grew almost 17% adjusting for the ASP divestiture despite the negative impact from the sell-through of product stocking that occurred in the first quarter to ensure there was product available to support the expected market recovery in subsequent quarters. We expect most of this product stocking to be depleted in Q4. Most other OUS markets experienced significant improvements compared to Q2. However, the state of procedure recovery has varied by market due to factors such as the structure of different healthcare systems, and localized decisions regarding COVID-19 restrictions. Consistent with what we shared in the prior quarter, the impact to results related to selling days was immaterial for this quarter. As a reminder, we will have extra selling days in the fourth quarter as a result of the 53rd week. Interventional solutions returned to double-digit growth this quarter across both the U.S. and OUS regions delivering 12.4% growth globally. The U.S. and China were the primary drivers with newer product offerings in both electrophysiology and CERENOVUS, positively contributing to both market and share growth for the quarter. Additionally, we received approval from the U.S. FDA for our THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Ablation Catheter for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation making it the only radio frequency catheter on the U.S. market with this indication. Worldwide orthopaedics declined 3.1% versus prior year, with the U.S. returning to growth for the quarter. Hips grew 1.9% globally led by strong us growth of 8.7%. This reflects both market recovery, as well as strength from our leadership position in the U.S. in the anterior approach and related demand for products like the ACTIS total hip system and enabling technologies.  Sales outside the U.S. declined by 8.4% due to COVID-19, as well as product stocking reductions in China worth over 250 basis points. Worldwide trauma returned to growth in Q3 delivering 0.7% growth globally. U.S. growth of 4.2% for the quarter reflects COVID-19 related procedural recovery, as well as continued strength of our newer products, such as the Femoral Neck Systems, and Cannulated Compression Screws. OUS declines reflect slower procedure volumes due to COVID-19. We continue to see stabilization of our spine business with recent launches of SYMPHONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT. Global results for this platform were flat versus prior year.  The knee market accelerated versus Q2 performance, but is recovering slower than the other segments of orthopaedics. The U.S. recovery was better than other markets declining about 2% primarily driven by COVID-19. Performance was aided by the continued success of products like ATTUNE Revision and Cementless. While improving from a Q2 decline of 55.3%, Q3 OUS sales decline of 26.4% reflects slower market recovery, especially in revision procedures where we have higher penetration than primary. Performance was also negatively impacted by a comparison to strong double-digit adjusted growth in the third quarter of 2019. Pricing continues to be a factor in orthopaedics. For the quarter, U.S. price returned to more historic levels, down low single-digits. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced surgery showed significant improvement versus Q2, but still declined by 1.2% due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide energy and endocutters declined about 7% and 3%, respectively. We continue to experience competitive pressures in the U.S. However, relative to the market, both platforms performed well outside the U.S., especially in China due to the strength of new products. Global biosurgery increased over 5%, reflecting share gains from new products and the return of SURGIFLO plus thrombin to the U.S. market after the supply disruption in the prior year. Last year's supply disruption impacted biosurgery growth by about 400 basis points in the quarter. Global wound closure declined less than 5%, in line with the market recovery with continued competitive growth in both the U.S. and China. The vision business declined 9.5% globally. U.S. contact lens growth of about 13% was largely driven by product stocking worth about 11 points, which is expected to return to more normalized levels in Q4. OUS contact lens improved versus the prior quarter. The decline of 18% was negatively impacted by a prior year prebuy in advance of consumption tax increase in Japan worth about 5 points. We continue to advance our contact lens pipeline with the world's first and only drug releasing contact lens for patients with allergic eye itch having received approval from Health Canada for ACUVUE Theravision. Surgical vision declined 16.4% globally due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on procedures and competitive pressures in U.S. I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see that we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.20 reflects a reported increase of 3.8% and an operational increase of 2.4%.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold remained flat versus 2019 as a percent of sales as COVID-19-related fixed cost deleveraging in the Medical Devices business was offset by favorable mix in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceuticals business, partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales and increased brand marketing expense investments in the Consumer business.  We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 13.5% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the third quarter of 2019 by 100 basis points driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business, increased investment in robotics and digital platforms, and the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales. The other income and expense line showed net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $4.2 billion last year. 2019 includes $4 billion related to the initial agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and we've recorded an additional $1 billion in the third quarter of 2020 based on continued negotiations of an all-in settlement amount for the state, local and tribal governments opioid litigation claims for a cumulative total of $5 billion. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased from a 6.4% benefit in the third quarter of 2019 to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, the third quarter 2019 tax rate was significantly affected by the aforementioned $4 billion agreement in principle. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19% versus 20.3% in the same period last year.  Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2020, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise increased by 0.1% versus the third quarter of 2019 to 34.4%. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 340 basis points to 46.4% primarily driven by favorable product mix, and selling and marketing expense leveraging. Medical Devices declined to 21.6% driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including sales declines and fixed cost deleveraging. Consumer Health margins improved by 280 basis points to 24.4% driven by favorable product mix, inclusive of progressing our SKU rationalization program. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Wolk : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks all of you for joining us today. 2020 has proven to be an eventful year with uncertainty sparking rapid change across many industries, particularly in healthcare. I'm honored to represent Johnson & Johnson management to acknowledge the tremendous resilience and the willingness of our colleagues across the globe to tackle the many challenges being encountered. Like in prior quarters, and for that matter, prior years, their strength, character and perseverance is the driving force behind our solid performance this quarter, while solidifying the foundation for long-term success across Johnson & Johnson's businesses. Our team continues to be hard at work pursuing a vaccine candidate to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are proud of the progress that has been made thus far. On September 23, we announced that the first participants were dosed in our pivotal multi-country Phase 3 trial ENSEMBLE, which will evaluate a single dose of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate in up to 60,000 people worldwide, including representation from high-risk populations and underrepresented communities. This follows positive interim results from our Phase 1/2a study, which showed the safety profile and immunogenicity after a single vaccination with our candidates supported for the development. These findings demonstrated that a single dose resulted in immunogenicity in all age groups with similar responses, including older adults. A single dose of a safe and effective vaccine could offer a significant advantage during a global pandemic. We also appreciate that a 2-dose regimen may have the potential for enhanced durability in some participants. Therefore, we plan to run a Phase 3 clinical trial with a 2-dose regimen beginning later this year. Simultaneously, we have scaled up manufacturing capacity and are on track to meet our goal of providing over 1 billion doses of a vaccine per year. We have committed to the public to provide the vaccine once approved on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. As we continue to progress our vaccine clinical program, we are committed to the highest ethical standards, sound scientific principles, pursuit of diversity and inclusion, and transparent communication of our processes and results. Let me be unequivocal here. We have not encountered any undue pressure, and we will maintain the rigorous requirements of research, development and manufacturing to bring a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to the public as we do for all our products. Mathai Mammen will provide a few words on the COVID-19 vaccine candidate at the conclusion of my remarks. Now let's take a deeper look into our results and outlook. Each of our business segments performed well in the third quarter despite COVID-19-related headwinds. We believe our Pharmaceutical segment once again outperformed the market, recovery in our Medical Device business was faster than anticipated. And in Consumer, our strategy focused on science-based products led to solid growth. While COVID dynamics continue to make the outlook fluid and perhaps not linear, we are encouraged by this progress and believe that we will continue to see improvement through the end of the year. As Chris mentioned in his remarks with respect to the additional accrual for opioid litigation, the amount crewed this quarter is intended to bring a comprehensive resolution to the overall opioid litigation with states, cities, counties and tribal governments for a final amount and provide certainty for involved parties and critical assistance for families and communities in need. Regarding our cash position, we ended the third quarter with approximately $7 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $38 billion of debt. Our balance sheet remains strong. We estimate free cash flow through the first 3 quarters to be more than $13 billion. In August, the company completed a $7.5 billion debt offering. We were able to secure historically low rates benefiting from the current low interest rate environment and our strong credit rating. Subsequent to the quarter, approximately $6.5 billion was used to fund our recently closed acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals. Our capital allocation strategy remains intact, committed to managing our entire business and portfolio with a long-term mindset.  While all aspects of our COVID-19 vaccine program are a top priority, we continue to invest in innovation in key areas of our pipeline across all parts of our business.  With respect to M&A, we continue to evaluate potential strategic opportunities that complement the robust R&D portfolio across our broad-based business while driving long-term value for our stakeholders. As I just noted earlier this month, we closed the Momenta Pharmaceuticals transaction, bolstering our pipeline with novel therapeutics being developed for immune-mediated diseases. We are particularly excited by the lead asset, nipocalimab, a potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. The science behind nipocalimab is advancing research in rare autoantibody-driven diseases with significant unmet need with current Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic diseases of the fetus and newborn, and myasthenia gravis. We plan to build on this foundation with additional indications planned in serious dermatological, rheumatic, neurologic and hematologic diseases. Many of these autoantibody diseases have no adequate standard-of-care today. Finally, on capital allocation, our dividend remains a top priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.7 billion to shareholders, in line with the 6.3% increase we announced in April. We continue to make progress advancing key pipeline assets that are expected to deliver long-term growth. Beyond what Chris mentioned in his remarks, there are a few other pipeline items worth highlighting. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline. During the third quarter, we received FDA approval for a second indication of SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. We did make a strategic decision to discontinue development of Pimodivir, an investigational treatment for Influenza A, based on recent results from pre-planned interim analysis that found Pimodivir in combination with the standard-of-care did not demonstrate added benefit in hospitalized patients. As we head into the fourth quarter, we look forward to additional planned submissions, most notably our U.S. filing of our BCMA CAR-T in multiple myeloma as well as the U.S. filing for amivantamab in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding digital robotic surgery in our Medical Device business, we made a significant step for our orthopaedic solution, submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the U.S. FDA in September for our VELYS robotic-assisted solutions for total knee arthroplasty. This is another important milestone in our digital surgery program, complementing the commercial success we have seen with Monarch. As you may recall, we planned a full Medical Device business review back in May and I hoped we could provide that in-person event sometime this year. However, given the ongoing limitations for in-person events, we decided to provide a shorter, limited scope virtual update on our Medical Device business featuring all of our digital surgery solutions. We scheduled this for Thursday, November 19, and we'll provide additional event details in the coming weeks. So let's now turn to our full year 2020 guidance and key updates. As I noted, based on our third quarter results across the enterprise and the continued progress we saw in procedure volumes, we are confident to increase our guidance. To provide you a little more insights regarding our Medical Devices business, as you can see from our results, we exceeded our expectations as the market recovery was even stronger-than-anticipated as hospital and surgeons continue to work through the pent-up demand resulting from restrictions on procedures earlier in the year. Moving to the fourth quarter, we are expecting continued procedure stabilization slightly ahead of our assumptions communicated last quarter. We are updating our range to be flat to down 10% versus flat to down 15% provided last quarter. As a reminder, this range is compared with our original estimates to start the year when we were expecting to continue our positive sales momentum prior to the pandemic. This updated range reflects continued improvement with fourth quarter sales expectations around 2019 levels. This forecast reflects our latest thinking based on what we know today and is consistent with our efforts throughout the year to provide transparency around our assumptions. Taking the qualitative factors related to each of our segments into account, and based on recent developments, we are making the following adjustments to our 2020 guidance: Adjusted operational sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. Moving on to operational sales. Our guidance is $82 billion to $82.8 billion or flat to growth of 1% versus 2019. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.17, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points versus the negative 130 basis points provided in our July guidance or an improvement of 30 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales change between minus 1% to flat compared to 2019 or $81.2 billion to $82 billion. We are expecting our operating margins to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 100 basis points decline with planned investments across all of our business segments in the fourth quarter. We are tightening our other income guidance to $800 million to $900 million versus our previous guidance of $800 million to $1 billion. We are tightening the range of net interest expense, now expected to be net interest expense of $100 million to $150 million. We are also tightening the range of our effective tax rate guidance for 2020, estimated at 17.0% to 17.5%. Given those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $7.95 and to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share versus our July guidance and now reflects no translational currency impact for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.95 to $8.05 or a range of minus 8.4% to minus 7.3%. In case you're now doing a double take, yes, that is the same range I just provided for constant currency. So essentially, on income, we are estimating no year-on-year impact from currency. While not providing guidance related to 2021 at this time, I'd like to provide some early perspectives on how we are thinking about next year for consideration in your financial modeling. We anticipate our Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong, continuing to reach more patients with best-in-class products in areas of high unmet need. As such, we expect to continue delivering solid volume-driven above market growth in 2021.  In Consumer Health, we expect to grow competitively with the market, driven by priority areas and enhanced strength in e-commerce. We expect that continued SKU rationalization and 2020 COVID-related sales comparisons, primarily in OTC, can be a headwind in the first half of 2021.  With respect to margins, we have demonstrated a steady cadence of margin improvement. Our previously announced SKU rationalization will result in margin improvement. But given the tremendous progress the team has made in recent years to reach benchmark levels, the improvement will not be as significant as we've experienced the last [few] years. In our Medical Devices segment, we anticipate a continued increase in procedures associated with pandemic recovery. We continue to believe in the strong underlying fundamentals in the medical device market, such as aging demographics and unmet need, coupled with hospital systems that have successfully navigated the pandemic. As I said on our second quarter earnings call, hospitals are much better prepared for any potential COVID resurgence that become even more efficient in the allocation of resources to meet the needs of all patients. While we certainly continue to watch closely as the rest of 2020 plays out, we remain optimistic heading into 2021. And as you might expect, anticipate to deliver robust double-digit sales growth. Moving on to a few comments related to the 2021 P&L. Consistent with sales, we also anticipate strong comparative year-over-year earnings per share. This is in part due to the 2020 dynamics but also in part due to the strength of our businesses. At this time, we anticipate that operating margin will be more in the range of where we ended 2019. For R&D, we will continue to invest for the long-term and anticipate that level of spend to be in the same range of approximately 14% of sales, consistent with prior years. Lastly, it's important to note that we are committed to the incremental investment necessary to advance our pipeline, inclusive of the negative impact to EPS related to the Momenta acquisition, and that in 2021, the impact to EPS is approximately dilution of $0.10 to $0.15 as we disclosed at the deal signing. We remain confident in our strength heading into 2021 and optimistic in our long-term outlook. I want to thank the business leaders joining our call today, Jennifer, Ashley, Thibaut and Mathai to engage in the Q&A session. In fact, I'm going to take the liberty of kicking off this portion of the webcast with the topic that we are often asked, that being the impact of COVID-19, not only this year but what we anticipate for 2021 by requesting each of these leaders to provide a few brief comments on their respective businesses. And then we'll have Mathai address the state of our vaccine candidate development. Jennifer, let's start with you.\nJennifer Taubert : Well, thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It's really nice to have the opportunity to speak with you today. I'd like to start by acknowledging all those who have been and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. I sincerely hope that you and those closest to you, remain healthy and safe. I'm really proud of the Pharmaceuticals group performance in the third quarter. We know that illnesses don't hit pause just because there's a global pandemic. So whether battling cancer, facing mental health challenges or living with an autoimmune disease, patients rely on our transformational medicines every single day. As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business grew 4.6% operationally in the third quarter, and we delivered our 10th consecutive quarter with sales that exceeded $10 billion and our second quarter with sales exceeding $11 billion. 7 of our key brands grew at double-digit rates, including our oncology brands, ERLEADA, DARZALEX and IMBRUVICA; our immunology brands, STELARA and TREMFYA; and our pulmonary hypertension brands OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And despite the pressures that COVID-19 placed on our business, our growth year-to-date is roughly 6%, definitely above market growth. During the third quarter, we kept a relentless focus on innovation and on delivering for our patients and customers around the world. So we worked really hard to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio of marketed medicines. We delivered on our pipeline of transformational medicines, and we advanced our next wave of innovation. In Q3, we continued the very successful launch of DARZALEX FASPRO, which is our subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX to treat multiple myeloma and we received approvals for SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. And we filed UPTRAVI IV for pulmonary arterial hypertension and DARZALEX for light chain amyloidosis. And on October 1, we closed our acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, which provides a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth through expansion into and leadership in autoantibody-driven diseases. 2020 has been an unprecedented year, and we've adapted our business to meet the new challenges that have been posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We quickly transitioned to scaling omni-channel capabilities to engage with healthcare providers. We enabled patients to both start and stay on therapy using virtual tools and we deployed a number of technologies to help keep our clinical trials on track. And despite some negative impact related to COVID-19 in the quarter, we also saw encouraging signs of recovery in our market performance across multiple metrics. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, and we feel confident in our ability to grow above the market on a full year basis in 2020. And also our expectations of where our business is heading remain unchanged, and we continue to plan for another strong year of above market growth in 2021.  So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today, and I look forward to any questions. But first, let me go ahead and turn it over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley?\nAshley McEvoy : Thank you, Jennifer. Well, listen, clearly, the Med Dev market has been disrupted by this once in a generation event. And I, too, would like to start by acknowledging that this recovery would not be possible without the heroic efforts of healthcare workers around the world. Their selfless dedication to patient care has just been amazing. And I must give a shout out to our J&Jers who since day 1 in Wuhan have been partnering with our customers, covering cases, managing both COVID-19 patients as well as helping to stand back up other important medical procedures. So as Jennifer mentioned, COVID has really been an accelerant for shifts within the med tech industry, really creating a lot of new creative solutions related to digital patient engagement, virtual surgeon training, a shift in sites of care and continued evolution in our business models. We've risen to this challenge in rethinking how we engage with our customers. To name a couple of examples, we partnered with an education partner, Advances in Surgery, where we virtually trained over 1 million surgeons in 150 different countries on COVID-19 protocols as well as ways to safely stand back up medical procedures. We've incorporated remote clinical case support to assist and connect customers around the world. And most recently, in September, we launched resources to educate patients about the importance of routine medical visits and the implications of deferring treatment with the My Health Can't Wait campaign. During the pandemic, we meaningfully advanced our innovation agenda. We continue to increase the overall value of our new product pipeline and are shifting to more substantial and transformational innovation. In quarter 3, we received FDA approval for the indication to treat persistent atrial fibrillation in our Biosense Webster business. We were granted approval from Health Canada for a first of its kind drug-eluting contact lens for allergy sufferers. We submitted our FDA filing for our upcoming VELYS robotic-assisted knee replacement program. We received FDA clearance for our dual mobility hip, a high growth segment. And lastly, we've begun a rollout of an entire revamp of our Ethicon Endocutter ECHELON platform from [budgeted] to powered circular staplers to improve stapling mechanisms, all to reduce leaks and improve outcomes. So as we've been talking about med tech, really, we've been on this 3-year improvement journey, and we are demonstrating progress with growth year-over-year from 1.5% in 2017 to 3.9% in 2019. While COVID temporarily interrupted this progression, our results this quarter demonstrate that in addition to the overall market recovery, the strategic choices we've made to strengthen our competitiveness and our relentless focus on customers and patients are working. It's good to see our largest market, United States grow positive, up 1% growth. Our second largest market, China, delivered 17% growth and platforms like Biosense Webster and CERENOVUS grew double-digits. And hip, trauma and biosurgery, all posted low to mid-single-digit growth. So looking forward, there's still going to be factors like patient willingness and affordability of medical care, which will continue to drive some level of uncertainty in the near term. However, when I look at the end markets overall in med tech, I continue to be optimistic as there's still unmet clinical need to be met. So knowing what we know today with the impact of COVID and what it had on 2020, I expect that we're going to deliver robust double-digit operational growth in 2021. Thanks for your time. Looking forward to the questions. And now I'm going to turn it over to Thibaut.\nThibaut Mongon : Thank you, Ashley, and good morning to all of you on the call. As you heard from Chris, this quarter, again, we have seen that our consumer brands have been very resilient during this unprecedented time. Our Consumer Health sector grew at 33% operationally in the quarter, delivering a 3.4% operational growth on a year-to-date basis, while continuing to expand our margins and this is a testament to the strength of strategy of offering differentiated science-based brands focused on personal health and those by professionals. So in today's environment, consumers globally have heightened interest in personal health and hygiene, and it's driving high demand for efficacious trusted solutions backed by science, like those offered by Johnson & Johnson. And an example of that preference would be the tremendous growth we have seen in our over-the-counter medicine business driven by brands like TYLENOL, ZYRTEC, PEPCID and ZARBEE\u2019S, or in our oral care franchise with LISTERINE mouthwash. In other parts of our business like skin health and beauty, results have been more nuanced. We have seen a negative impact of COVID-19 in categories like sun care and makeup removers, while seeing increased demand for body wash, body lotions or premium hair care. So for 2021, we expect both headwinds and tailwinds as we saw this year. But we strongly believe that our strategy, our capabilities and our focus on execution position us very well for continued performance. We are prepared to see ongoing fluctuation in consumer demand related to the pandemic, potential pantry loading behaviors or lower incidence of conditions like cold and flu. However, even with these uncertainties in mind, we expect to see continued strong growth in e-commerce and continued demand for our leading brands with efficacy is backed by science, resulting in our Consumer Health business to continue to grow competitively with the market in 2021. And with this, let me hand over to Mathai Mammen.\nMathai Mammen : Thank you, Thibaut. Let me now give you a brief update on our COVID-19 vaccine. First, a reminder of a bit of background. On the heels of some really promising Phase 1 and 2a data, we initiated a single dose Phase 3 study called ENSEMBLE a few weeks ago on September 21 in the United States, and we're in the process of opening numerous sites globally. Our vaccine, as a reminder, is based on Ad26. This is a human adenovirus and contains a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our vaccine was shown to elicit a robust immune response in humans as demonstrated by the presence of neutralizing antibodies in T cells. I'd like to now elaborate on the statement we posted on our website yesterday regarding a temporary pause in further dosing in our COVID vaccine clinical trials. First, some context. It's not at all unusual for unexpected illnesses that occur in large studies over their duration. In some cases, they\u2019re called serious adverse events or SAEs, and may have something or nothing to do with the drug or vaccine being investigated. However, as a company that always puts safety first, we take each and every case seriously. In certain cases, when we need more information, we pause the enrollment and dosing of additional participants as we take the time to gather more information. We have a very defined and well thought due process at J&J that follows high standards of scientific, medical and ethical factors, and we followed all of that to the letters here. First, preliminary information is sent to an independent data and safety monitoring board or DSMB. DSMB, as you know, are very commonly part of trials in the pharmaceutical industry. This board is comprised of outside experts who evaluate the information and then make a recommendation to us. In our case here, we were informed of an unexpected illness on Sunday evening October 11, and we followed our process exactly and quickly and posted a statement on our website the following day on Monday, October 12 pausing enrollment. The DSMB was informed immediately on Sunday, and they've requested additional information. We're now awaiting further medical information and evaluation, which we will then forward to the DSMB for their independent recommendation. We're absolutely committed to providing transparent updates throughout our vaccine development program, and we will update you when we lean more. And finally, I'd like -- I would be remiss if I didn't express great enthusiasm for the R&D portfolio at Janssen. I'm very excited with all the really tremendous progress we made against the programs in our portfolio in spite of COVID-19, continue to make deep investments and terrific progress on currently marketed products to extend them further and against new molecular entities. Highlights were already mentioned that include DARZALEX FASPRO for AL amyloidosis, progress as we continue to build on TREMFYA, amivantamab, our CD3 redirector franchise, BCMA CAR-T, RPGR gene therapy and many others. So happy to address any of that in the Q&A. I'll hand it now back to Chris DelOrefice. Chris?\nChris DelOrefice : Terrific. Thank you, Mathai. And thank you, Jennifer, Ashley and Thibaut. Rob, let's now move to questions from the investment community. Can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lewis : Mathai, maybe I'll start with you just as we finished with you. Is there a realistic timeframe for us to learn if the adverse event was in the treatment or placebo arm? And any sense right now if the AE was neurological in nature?\nMathai Mammen : So, we know very little information right now. We've given our information set that we do know to the DSMB, and they've asked a number of specific questions. We don't know whether they haven't informed us. They have the right to unblind. We are still blinded. So we don't know treatment arm, vaccine arm. We know very little at this point. And it will be a few days at minimum for the right set of information to be gathered and evaluated.\nDavid Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And I'll just ask my other two questions right upfront, maybe one for Ashley and one for Joe. Ashley, just thinking about the MDD commentary for September, which suggested improvement but some arresting of improvement in the month of September. As I think about guidance range at the top end, you basically get to do the top end of your range for the fourth quarter to show improvement in the fourth quarter. So what is your confidence in delivering the top end of the range? And what are some of the factors in the fourth quarter that could impact the ability to show sequential improvement? And then for Joe, just quickly on pharma. Thanks for the outlook for '21. Pharma has accelerated the entire year on both the reported and underlying basis, obviously, above market next year. Can pharma accelerate in '21?\nAshley McEvoy : So thanks for the question, David. Maybe I'll start with really -- obviously, we ended Q3 down 3%. As Joe mentioned, our expectations for quarter 4, they're really in line with the range communicated in July. We've tightened it a bit to make it from flat to down 10%. And just as a reminder, this is a guide versus what we originally communicated in the beginning of the year in January of our plan. So if you look at this, it means that our range for quarter 4 could be consistent with the results we delivered in quarter 3, a kind of one-bookend to then delivering some modest growth versus 2019 last year. And things that we're considering, I do think that we're confident in how hospitals are managing through the surges. We are paying close attention to patient sentiment and affordability. And at J&J, I believe, Chris mentioned, we did have -- we are bleeding through some inventory that we procured truly in the beginning of the year for China. And we will be also adjusting from, as Chris mentioned, coming off of last year the Japan consumption tax. So those are two things to consider, one from this year and one from last year. \nJoe Wolk : And David, with respect to Pharmaceuticals, I do think that we could see acceleration. So, the in-line portfolio continues to perform extremely well as we've seen. We're getting nice uptake in some of our larger products, notably STELARA in UC, which was recently an approval we acquired, TREMFYA for PSA. I would also point to some of the filings that we anticipate here in the near-term with respect to the CAR-T BCMA as well as amivantamab for non-small cell lung cancer, potentially on the horizon and part of the mix in 2021. I will also point out that while this quarter was strong, we still have some impact in all three segments related to COVID-19 dynamics. So, there's probably 2 to 3 points of growth that hampered the third quarter reported results. As you can imagine, there's still a segment of the population that's a little bit cautious about going out in public, having their normal office visits. So, I would anticipate that should come back as therapeutics, as vaccines, as people know more about the virus itself. So, it wouldn't be beyond our expectation to think that Jennifer and her team could do even better in 2021.\nChris DelOrefice: Rob, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott : The first one was just a bit of a clarification on the 2021 operating margin dynamics. I just want to make sure I understood what levels you're referring to with results in line with 2019 margins, specifically. Is that including or excluding the ASP gain last year? And as I think about \u201821 margins, would you characterize those as normalized margins for J&J or are these still margins that are going to be depressed as we're facing some COVID disruptions? My second question was just on pharma pricing, and how you're thinking about that for '21. I guess, specifically, as we think about higher unemployment rates and adverse payer mix, is there any expectation we should be thinking about pricing at all different in '21 versus what we're seeing in 2020?\nJoe Wolk : Chris, thanks for the questions. I'll take the first question around margins, and then I'll turn it over to Jennifer to give some thoughts with respect to an outlook to the extent we can provide on pharmaceutical pricing. So, with margins, in my commentary, I referenced, we should be around 2019 operating margin levels, that would exclude other income. So, it would exclude the ASP divestiture gain that you've referenced. Our operating margin for 2019 was 31.3%. We expect to get back to that level. We're going to continue to invest in our pipeline. Recall, too, that in our projections for 2021, we're looking at the Momenta transaction, which was dilutive by as much as $0.15. So that's part of the mix. But I would say, Chris, to probably best labelled, if I was to label them as normal operating margins, we expect to grow our bottom line slightly faster than our top line in most years. And so, I think we'll continue to look to do that with respect to the portfolio and our investment capacity, but not compromising the long-term at any point in time.\nJennifer Taubert : Chris, it's Jennifer. I can jump in on the pricing one. So, whether it's based on unemployment trends or whether it's based on healthcare reform, we do see that there is going to be continued pressure on pricing across the pharma industry. I think an important reminder is that for us, our growth is all based on volume, not price. So, we think relative to our competitive set, that we are very well positioned for this future environment. We work very, very hard to develop robust value propositions and to be able to get appropriate value for our products in the market, and we'll continue to do so. But whether it's through healthcare reform efforts, which actually we think could ultimately have a positive if it can help lower patient out-of-pocket costs or through other channel mix and dynamics, we do think that there will be continued pressure there.\nChris DelOrefice: Thank you, Chris, appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: One for Ashley, one for Jennifer. Ashley, I appreciate the commentary about 2021, you expect double-digit growth. My question is, can you grow in 2021 over 2020 -- 2019 levels in the device business. And for Jennifer, you have the SUSTENNA bench trial starting this week. Can you offer any thoughts on that? Do you still believe it will be very difficult for a generic company to manufacture a generic version of SUSTENNA even if you lose that litigation?\nAshley McEvoy: Thank you, Larry. So listen, for 2021, we do anticipate, as I mentioned, double-digit growth versus 2020. And we do anticipate growth in 2021 relative to where we exited 2019.\nJennifer Taubert : And then if we talk about INVEGA SUSTENNA, we are very confident in our IP positions around our long-acting injectable portfolio, whether we're talking about INVEGA SUSTENNA, whether we're talking about INVEGA TRINZA, those products bring significant benefit to patients with schizophrenia. And so Larry, as you noted, we do have the bench trial that's starting, but that we feel good in our position there and that those assets are going to continue to be able to deliver not only for patients with schizophrenia, but also for Janssen and for Johnson & Johnson.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.\nJosh Jennings : First question for Ashley. I was hoping -- just thanks for the 2021 outlook on the Medical Devices franchise, but I was hoping you could help us think through the risk the Affordable Care Act being repealed by the Trump administration? And then secondarily, if unemployment levels stay where they are, what type of headwinds you expect in 2021 and whether those have been baked into that 2021 outlook? And then I was also hoping for Jennifer to ask about the immunology franchise just by revenue it\u2019s been largest business in pharma, seems like bolstering it through the Momenta acquisition. But wanted to ask about any updates you can provide on the outlook for REMICADE declines with the premise being just if that anchor can get lighter, declines can be tempered, that would be a positive for that immunology franchise in 2021 and beyond. But any help you can give on the outlook for REMICADE from here?\nAshley McEvoy: Well, thank you, Josh. I think your question was about the ACA. And in our business for J&J Med Device, we have about 60% of our payer mix as public. Clearly, a big chunk of that is Medicare and then the smaller amount of Medicaid and about 40% private. So we do anticipate Medicaid increasing its amount, and we do anticipate given employment and some of the economic challenges that, that private amount may decrease a bit. So we\u2019ve factored those into our considerations when you look at 2021. And then I think your second question was really around patient sentiment. And I would tell you that, that's fast-evolving data that we look at weekly and monthly. And we are always looking to how do we replenish that funnel, and we've factored those considerations into our assumptions into 2021.\nJennifer Taubert : Yes. And then it's Jennifer. I'll jump in on the immunology front. So immunology, as you know, is our largest business for the Janssen franchise and continues to deliver very, very strong growth. And both STELARA and TREMFYA delivered very solid quarters. STELARA is showing very significant gains globally in both Crohn's Disease and in the ulcerative colitis launch. And very importantly, just this week, we have 5-year long-term remission data in Crohn's Disease that is actually being presented publicly, which we think is another great catalyst and demonstration of the significant benefits that STELARA offers to patients in the GI space. From a TREMFYA perspective, we've got very strong growth and competitiveness as we continue to launch into not only psoriasis, but now also psoriatic arthritis, which we think is going to be a great catalyst, not only for psoriatic arthritis, but also for the psoriasis business. And right now with TREMFYA, we're the only IL-23 that has that psoriatic arthritis indication and hopefully, as you know, we're also studying it for GI applications and our Crohn's Phase 2 data was actually presented this week as well at the United European Gastroenterology Week. So using our IL-23 pathway strategy, we're not only developing TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but also taking it into the GI space where we believe that we're going to be able to benefit even more patients because there's still so much unmet medical need there. Now you've referenced Momenta, and we were really excited to both announce that deal and to close that deal in a very short timeframe. And that acquisition is going to give us the opportunity to enter into the autoantibody space, where we believe for nipocalimab, we've got as many as 10 or more indications that we're going to be able to go into to really transform autoantibody-related diseases. And just about all of these are very underserved, in many cases, we'll be able to be first-in-class, and we believe, best-in-class, and we think this is going to be a really significant catalyst for us. We've also got a number of other assets in the immunology portfolio, the one we brought in bermekimab from XBiotech. We've got other novel mechanisms that are being developed in GI applications, and we'll look forward to really unveiling the true breadth of our immunology pipeline when we have our Analyst Day in 2021. But so let me come back to your question on REMICADE. REMICADE, I think we can anticipate continued relatively similar declines going forward as that product is very, very late in its life cycle. But please know across the breadth of our immunology portfolio, we have got a ton of strength there and are really planning on continuing -- having that be one of our leading franchises for the Janssen business globally.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate it. Rob, next question please?\nOperator: Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy : Ashley, this is a question for you. And I guess I'm curious, you gave a lot of color, I appreciate that. So I just want to get a little bit deeper. And I'm wondering if you guys could characterize what you're seeing from a backlog work down versus new patients entering the system, if there's a way to sort of even qualitatively characterize that? And then the second part of the question for Ashley, I'll just ask it now. As we think about the referral funnel refill within devices, and maybe this is even an appropriate question for pharma and diagnoses, where do you see the areas that are most susceptible should we see some hiccups in the referral funnel reselling?\nAshley McEvoy : So thank you, Danielle. When we look at -- again, I have to give a huge acknowledgment to our customers, quite frankly, around the world of how they've really figured out how to manage people with COVID as well as manage patients who don't have COVID. And when we look at our top 10 markets, we see about a 95% recovery to-date in the past 4 weeks. And really, obviously, with China leading the way, but we also saw positives in areas like Germany, in areas like Russia. In the United States, it is around 95%, and -- which is remarkable, if you think about it, that we're in October. And then we look at the top 10 IDNs, which are really -- many of those are presenting more hotter spots for COVID, they're around 92% recovered. And clearly, some hospitals are well above 100, and some are a little softer than that. And so I think it really demonstrates to us that they have really learned how to manage those patient populations quite well. And when we go forward, we did see in quarter 3, a significant kind of clearing out of the patient backlog. We think when we go into quarter 4, there's a little bit more to go. What we're paying attention to is really the diagnosis, Danielle, to say, let me give you an example, colorectal surgery. Those colorectal surgeries in the United States are down about 10% to 12% from a procedure point of view versus pre-COVID baseline. But the diagnosis, the colonoscopy is down about 20% to 30%. Now that's improving because that used to be down 50%. So we're looking at MRIs for joint and spine surgeries. And when we start to see that number improve, I think it shows that the new patient funnel is starting to replenish at a pace we hope to have.\nJennifer Taubert : So when we look on the pharma side, so we continue to see improving new-to-brand trends. For some of the assets, there's still a little bit below pre-COVID levels as patients are just getting back in for the diagnosis and the workups and everything to ultimately get diagnosed and then treated. But as we take a look at total demand, most of our brands and as we're looking across the market, are really back to and above pre-COVID levels. And we\u2019re definitely seeing stability and some growth in that area. I think while new-to-brand has still been a bit depressed, what we're seeing is higher rates of refills, higher rates of persistency and lower rates of switch. And so they sort of compensate for each other. And so we've been really pleased with the recovery that we've seen. We think that our customers as well are really adapting and figuring out how to use a combination of both telehealth as well as in-person visits depending upon the actual patient and potential diagnosis and we see very positive trends going forward. And should there be any type of second wave, we think that they're going to be much better able to handle that in the second wave than what we saw originally.\nChris DelOrefice: Rob, next question please?\nOperator: Next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn : I was just wondering on the COVID vaccine, if you can remind us of what you're hoping to show on the efficacy profile? And then second part of that question is, what steps both you and the industry can take to encourage broad utilization of a vaccine, if successful? And then my second question relates to your EGFR MET antibody, some pretty compelling Phase 1 data at ESMO this year. You mentioned this asset a couple of times in your remarks, but maybe you could just expand on the development program here for lung cancer and also other tumors, such as head and neck and colorectal and remind us of how you're thinking about both the near-term opportunity as well as the longer term opportunity?\nChris DelOrefice: Mathai, do you want to address the vaccine question and start with the pipeline?\nMathai Mammen : Sure. So in terms of the vaccine overall, like as soon as we overcome this temporary pause. Our plan is to continue to pursue studies that were on route. And the vaccine efficacy -- specifically was your question, all statistical analysis plan assume something and we've assumed 70% vaccine efficacy for this trial. But of course, based on the Phase 1/2a data, we're very bullish on that or better efficacy. So, if we happen to see better efficacy than that, what will happen, we\u2019ll see events -- will -- as they come in, will show a greater imbalance between placebo and vaccine. And we have a chance to finish even faster. And so that's how it'll manifest, we just assume something for the moment. But that doesn\u2019t actually dictate how the study is conducted. \nChris DelOrefice: Jennifer, do you want to take the broader vaccine question, and we can come back to amivantamab. \nJennifer Taubert: Sure. So a couple of points. So first, our industry is demonstrating really heroic and historic leadership during this public health crisis. And between everything that, the R&D teams and manufacturing teams are doing around the clock to help bring forward new vaccines and new treatments, as well as what the commercial teams are doing to be prepared to both be able to supply these products in the marketplace but also make sure that there's going to be a receptive audience and demand, people actually wanting to get these vaccines once they get to market. There's a lot of work that's underway there now. What I can say is, as an industry group, we really have come together. And in working with our local industry associations, be they bio or pharma in the U.S., be at IFPMA ex-U.S., there's a lot of work that's underway to help develop and build vaccine confidence across the board by different types of audiences. So everything from making sure that providers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, people who would be involved in the administration have accurate information and information that they can use with their patients, because they're viewed so positively to broad campaigns, to even very targeted local campaigns to get add on specific minority populations, who otherwise might not be as receptive. All of this work is currently underway and I think you can look forward to many types of different campaigns to enroll all of the appropriate folks at the appropriate time, once we have greater line of sight into when these products will actually be able to reach the market.  But safe to say everybody realizes the vaccine confidence is really, really key. And there's a lot of great work that that's being done and more to come on that as we're able to start unveiling it as the products get closer to the market and emergencies authorizations. \nThibaut Mongon : Thanks, Jennifer. Maybe I can take the question on the EGFR-cMet antibody amivantamab. It is a really exciting project for us. You asked about near-term and long-term. First on the antibody itself, it's a really interesting antibody. It's unique to us and it incorporates both EGFR binding peak and the CMS binding peak and CMS is common resistance mechanism for EGFR therapy. So it's both the primary mutation and the resistance mechanism at the same time. The near-term plan is to go forward with an Exon 20 EGFR tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, there are really no good opportunities for patients with Exon 20 signatures. But that's how we will begin but our eyes are on the larger EGFR mutation market and patients in non-small lung cancer. So with time, we plan on exploring multiple lines of therapy and eventually all EGFR containing tumors.\nChris DelOrefice: Rob, last question please?\nOperator: That comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nLouise Chen : So I wanted to ask you on the FDA. Have you any change in their appetite for risk. We've seen a recent speed of complete response letter, not sure if that's just a timing issue or if they've truly changed your thinking there? And then just a follow-up question here on the vaccine, how any potential changes to your vaccine program impact the manufacturing process you've already started? And how many patients have you dosed thus far?\nChris DelOrefice: Mathai, with the vaccine and then Jennifer and/or Mathai weighing on the FDA. Actually Mathai, why don' you start with the vaccine?\nMathai Mammen : Yes, vaccine question. So this interaction right now we're having with regulators and DSMB doesn't change our manufacturing process or plans at all. And we're well underway with our program right now, and we're looking forward to getting going. Our overall plans are to complete recruitment of the [50,000] subjects in 2 or 3 months, and that remains on track.\nJennifer Taubert : Yes. And in terms of our working with the agency, we've had a really good track record over the past few months, really during the height of COVID and continuing to submit files, have them accepted and really importantly, get approvals, not only on time but actually ahead of time. So as an example, our DARZALEX FASPRO formulation, our subcu form for multiple myeloma was actually approved ahead of schedule. We had an IMBRUVICA new indication. As you know, we've got 11 indications now for IMBRUVICA. And we had 1 of the new ones there approved ahead of time. I mentioned TREMFYA PSA in that approval. And I could go on and list others, but we continue to have very productive conversations with the FDA and continue to have our products moving through the pipeline as anticipated, and in some cases, even faster than planned.\nAshley McEvoy : Yes. Just to complement what Jennifer mentioned -- this is Ashley, Louise, I would just echo that from a med tech point of view. You heard us share around the new indication in our PMA for persistent AFib. But recently, in the past couple of months, we were granted a breakthrough designation for the slowing down the progression of myopia in our vision business. That's moving forward nicely, and we were granted a breakthrough designation that's moving forward nicely on the combination of our Monarch and Illumina Diagnostics, coupled with our NeuWave ablation technology for lung nodules. But from a notion of regulatory approvals and engagement as well as audits, I couldn't be more encouraged.\nChris DelOrefice : Great. Thank you, everyone. Thanks, Louise. Appreciate the question. And thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for some brief closing remarks.\nJoe Wolk : Great. Thank you, Chris, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining today's call to discuss our third quarter results and your very thoughtful questions. I'd also like to take a moment to just thank the Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their unrelenting commitment to deliver for patients and all of our stakeholders around the world. Don't forget to mark your calendars to join us for our virtual medical device update on Thursday, November 19. Best wishes for continued safety and health and know that we will responsibly provide relevant, transparent updates as warranted. Bye for now.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ashley McEvoy",
            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer. Well, listen, clearly, the Med Dev market has been disrupted by this once in a generation event. And I, too, would like to start by acknowledging that this recovery would not be possible without the heroic efforts of healthcare workers around the world. Their selfless dedication to patient care has just been amazing. And I must give a shout out to our J&Jers who since day 1 in Wuhan have been partnering with our customers, covering cases, managing both COVID-19 patients as well as helping to stand back up other important medical procedures. So as Jennifer mentioned, COVID has really been an accelerant for shifts within the med tech industry, really creating a lot of new creative solutions related to digital patient engagement, virtual surgeon training, a shift in sites of care and continued evolution in our business models. We've risen to this challenge in rethinking how we engage with our customers. To name a couple of examples, we partnered with an education partner, Advances in Surgery, where we virtually trained over 1 million surgeons in 150 different countries on COVID-19 protocols as well as ways to safely stand back up medical procedures. We've incorporated remote clinical case support to assist and connect customers around the world. And most recently, in September, we launched resources to educate patients about the importance of routine medical visits and the implications of deferring treatment with the My Health Can't Wait campaign. During the pandemic, we meaningfully advanced our innovation agenda. We continue to increase the overall value of our new product pipeline and are shifting to more substantial and transformational innovation. In quarter 3, we received FDA approval for the indication to treat persistent atrial fibrillation in our Biosense Webster business. We were granted approval from Health Canada for a first of its kind drug-eluting contact lens for allergy sufferers. We submitted our FDA filing for our upcoming VELYS robotic-assisted knee replacement program. We received FDA clearance for our dual mobility hip, a high growth segment. And lastly, we've begun a rollout of an entire revamp of our Ethicon Endocutter ECHELON platform from [budgeted] to powered circular staplers to improve stapling mechanisms, all to reduce leaks and improve outcomes. So as we've been talking about med tech, really, we've been on this 3-year improvement journey, and we are demonstrating progress with growth year-over-year from 1.5% in 2017 to 3.9% in 2019. While COVID temporarily interrupted this progression, our results this quarter demonstrate that in addition to the overall market recovery, the strategic choices we've made to strengthen our competitiveness and our relentless focus on customers and patients are working. It's good to see our largest market, United States grow positive, up 1% growth. Our second largest market, China, delivered 17% growth and platforms like Biosense Webster and CERENOVUS grew double-digits. And hip, trauma and biosurgery, all posted low to mid-single-digit growth. So looking forward, there's still going to be factors like patient willingness and affordability of medical care, which will continue to drive some level of uncertainty in the near term. However, when I look at the end markets overall in med tech, I continue to be optimistic as there's still unmet clinical need to be met. So knowing what we know today with the impact of COVID and what it had on 2020, I expect that we're going to deliver robust double-digit operational growth in 2021. Thanks for your time. Looking forward to the questions. And now I'm going to turn it over to Thibaut. So thanks for the question, David. Maybe I'll start with really -- obviously, we ended Q3 down 3%. As Joe mentioned, our expectations for quarter 4, they're really in line with the range communicated in July. We've tightened it a bit to make it from flat to down 10%. And just as a reminder, this is a guide versus what we originally communicated in the beginning of the year in January of our plan. So if you look at this, it means that our range for quarter 4 could be consistent with the results we delivered in quarter 3, a kind of one-bookend to then delivering some modest growth versus 2019 last year. And things that we're considering, I do think that we're confident in how hospitals are managing through the surges. We are paying close attention to patient sentiment and affordability. And at J&J, I believe, Chris mentioned, we did have -- we are bleeding through some inventory that we procured truly in the beginning of the year for China. And we will be also adjusting from, as Chris mentioned, coming off of last year the Japan consumption tax. So those are two things to consider, one from this year and one from last year. Thank you, Larry. So listen, for 2021, we do anticipate, as I mentioned, double-digit growth versus 2020. And we do anticipate growth in 2021 relative to where we exited 2019. Well, thank you, Josh. I think your question was about the ACA. And in our business for J&J Med Device, we have about 60% of our payer mix as public. Clearly, a big chunk of that is Medicare and then the smaller amount of Medicaid and about 40% private. So we do anticipate Medicaid increasing its amount, and we do anticipate given employment and some of the economic challenges that, that private amount may decrease a bit. So we've factored those into our considerations when you look at 2021. And then I think your second question was really around patient sentiment. And I would tell you that, that's fast-evolving data that we look at weekly and monthly. And we are always looking to how do we replenish that funnel, and we've factored those considerations into our assumptions into 2021. So thank you, Danielle. When we look at -- again, I have to give a huge acknowledgment to our customers, quite frankly, around the world of how they've really figured out how to manage people with COVID as well as manage patients who don't have COVID. And when we look at our top 10 markets, we see about a 95% recovery to-date in the past 4 weeks. And really, obviously, with China leading the way, but we also saw positives in areas like Germany, in areas like Russia. In the United States, it is around 95%, and -- which is remarkable, if you think about it, that we're in October. And then we look at the top 10 IDNs, which are really -- many of those are presenting more hotter spots for COVID, they're around 92% recovered. And clearly, some hospitals are well above 100, and some are a little softer than that. And so I think it really demonstrates to us that they have really learned how to manage those patient populations quite well.

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks all of you for joining us today. 2020 has proven to be an eventful year with uncertainty sparking rapid change across many industries, particularly in healthcare. I'm honored to represent Johnson & Johnson management to acknowledge the tremendous resilience and the willingness of our colleagues across the globe to tackle the many challenges being encountered. Like in prior quarters, and for that matter, prior years, their strength, character and perseverance is the driving force behind our solid performance this quarter, while solidifying the foundation for long-term success across Johnson & Johnson's businesses. Our team continues to be hard at work pursuing a vaccine candidate to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are proud of the progress that has been made thus far. On September 23, we announced that the first participants were dosed in our pivotal multi-country Phase 3 trial ENSEMBLE, which will evaluate a single dose of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate in up to 60,000 people worldwide, including representation from high-risk populations and underrepresented communities. This follows positive interim results from our Phase 1/2a study, which showed the safety profile and immunogenicity after a single vaccination with our candidates supported for the development. These findings demonstrated that a single dose resulted in immunogenicity in all age groups with similar responses, including older adults. A single dose of a safe and effective vaccine could offer a significant advantage during a global pandemic. We also appreciate that a 2-dose regimen may have the potential for enhanced durability in some participants. Therefore, we plan to run a Phase 3 clinical trial with a 2-dose regimen beginning later this year. Simultaneously, we have scaled up manufacturing capacity and are on track to meet our goal of providing over 1 billion doses of a vaccine per year. We have committed to the public to provide the vaccine once approved on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. As we continue to progress our vaccine clinical program, we are committed to the highest ethical standards, sound scientific principles, pursuit of diversity and inclusion, and transparent communication of our processes and results. Let me be unequivocal here. We have not encountered any undue pressure, and we will maintain the rigorous requirements of research, development and manufacturing to bring a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to the public as we do for all our products. Mathai Mammen will provide a few words on the COVID-19 vaccine candidate at the conclusion of my remarks. Now let's take a deeper look into our results and outlook. Each of our business segments performed well in the third quarter despite COVID-19-related headwinds. We believe our Pharmaceutical segment once again outperformed the market, recovery in our Medical Device business was faster than anticipated. And in Consumer, our strategy focused on science-based products led to solid growth. While COVID dynamics continue to make the outlook fluid and perhaps not linear, we are encouraged by this progress and believe that we will continue to see improvement through the end of the year. As Chris mentioned in his remarks with respect to the additional accrual for opioid litigation, the amount crewed this quarter is intended to bring a comprehensive resolution to the overall opioid litigation with states, cities, counties and tribal governments for a final amount and provide certainty for involved parties and critical assistance for families and communities in need. Regarding our cash position, we ended the third quarter with approximately $7 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $38 billion of debt. Our balance sheet remains strong. We estimate free cash flow through the first 3 quarters to be more than $13 billion. In August, the company completed a $7.5 billion debt offering. We were able to secure historically low rates benefiting from the current low interest rate environment and our strong credit rating. Subsequent to the quarter, approximately $6.5 billion was used to fund our recently closed acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals. Our capital allocation strategy remains intact, committed to managing our entire business and portfolio with a long-term mindset.  While all aspects of our COVID-19 vaccine program are a top priority, we continue to invest in innovation in key areas of our pipeline across all parts of our business.  With respect to M&A, we continue to evaluate potential strategic opportunities that complement the robust R&D portfolio across our broad-based business while driving long-term value for our stakeholders. As I just noted earlier this month, we closed the Momenta Pharmaceuticals transaction, bolstering our pipeline with novel therapeutics being developed for immune-mediated diseases. We are particularly excited by the lead asset, nipocalimab, a potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. The science behind nipocalimab is advancing research in rare autoantibody-driven diseases with significant unmet need with current Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic diseases of the fetus and newborn, and myasthenia gravis. We plan to build on this foundation with additional indications planned in serious dermatological, rheumatic, neurologic and hematologic diseases. Many of these autoantibody diseases have no adequate standard-of-care today. Finally, on capital allocation, our dividend remains a top priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.7 billion to shareholders, in line with the 6.3% increase we announced in April. We continue to make progress advancing key pipeline assets that are expected to deliver long-term growth. Beyond what Chris mentioned in his remarks, there are a few other pipeline items worth highlighting. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline. During the third quarter, we received FDA approval for a second indication of SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. We did make a strategic decision to discontinue development of Pimodivir, an investigational treatment for Influenza A, based on recent results from pre-planned interim analysis that found Pimodivir in combination with the standard-of-care did not demonstrate added benefit in hospitalized patients. As we head into the fourth quarter, we look forward to additional planned submissions, most notably our U.S. filing of our BCMA CAR-T in multiple myeloma as well as the U.S. filing for amivantamab in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding digital robotic surgery in our Medical Device business, we made a significant step for our orthopaedic solution, submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the U.S. FDA in September for our VELYS robotic-assisted solutions for total knee arthroplasty. This is another important milestone in our digital surgery program, complementing the commercial success we have seen with Monarch. As you may recall, we planned a full Medical Device business review back in May and I hoped we could provide that in-person event sometime this year. However, given the ongoing limitations for in-person events, we decided to provide a shorter, limited scope virtual update on our Medical Device business featuring all of our digital surgery solutions. We scheduled this for Thursday, November 19, and we'll provide additional event details in the coming weeks. So let's now turn to our full year 2020 guidance and key updates. As I noted, based on our third quarter results across the enterprise and the continued progress we saw in procedure volumes, we are confident to increase our guidance. To provide you a little more insights regarding our Medical Devices business, as you can see from our results, we exceeded our expectations as the market recovery was even stronger-than-anticipated as hospital and surgeons continue to work through the pent-up demand resulting from restrictions on procedures earlier in the year. Moving to the fourth quarter, we are expecting continued procedure stabilization slightly ahead of our assumptions communicated last quarter. We are updating our range to be flat to down 10% versus flat to down 15% provided last quarter. As a reminder, this range is compared with our original estimates to start the year when we were expecting to continue our positive sales momentum prior to the pandemic. This updated range reflects continued improvement with fourth quarter sales expectations around 2019 levels. This forecast reflects our latest thinking based on what we know today and is consistent with our efforts throughout the year to provide transparency around our assumptions. Taking the qualitative factors related to each of our segments into account, and based on recent developments, we are making the following adjustments to our 2020 guidance: Adjusted operational sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. Moving on to operational sales. Our guidance is $82 billion to $82.8 billion or flat to growth of 1% versus 2019. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.17, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points versus the negative 130 basis points provided in our July guidance or an improvement of 30 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales change between minus 1% to flat compared to 2019 or $81.2 billion to $82 billion. We are expecting our operating margins to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 100 basis points decline with planned investments across all of our business segments in the fourth quarter. We are tightening our other income guidance to $800 million to $900 million versus our previous guidance of $800 million to $1 billion. We are tightening the range of net interest expense, now expected to be net interest expense of $100 million to $150 million. We are also tightening the range of our effective tax rate guidance for 2020, estimated at 17.0% to 17.5%. Given those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $7.95 and to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share versus our July guidance and now reflects no translational currency impact for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.95 to $8.05 or a range of minus 8.4% to minus 7.3%. In case you're now doing a double take, yes, that is the same range I just provided for constant currency. So essentially, on income, we are estimating no year-on-year impact from currency. While not providing guidance related to 2021 at this time, I'd like to provide some early perspectives on how we are thinking about next year for consideration in your financial modeling. We anticipate our Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong, continuing to reach more patients with best-in-class products in areas of high unmet need. As such, we expect to continue delivering solid volume-driven above market growth in 2021.  In Consumer Health, we expect to grow competitively with the market, driven by priority areas and enhanced strength in e-commerce. We expect that continued SKU rationalization and 2020 COVID-related sales comparisons, primarily in OTC, can be a headwind in the first half of 2021.  With respect to margins, we have demonstrated a steady cadence of margin improvement. Our previously announced SKU rationalization will result in margin improvement. But given the tremendous progress the team has made in recent years to reach benchmark levels, the improvement will not be as significant as we've experienced the last [few] years. In our Medical Devices segment, we anticipate a continued increase in procedures associated with pandemic recovery. We continue to believe in the strong underlying fundamentals in the medical device market, such as aging demographics and unmet need, coupled with hospital systems that have successfully navigated the pandemic. As I said on our second quarter earnings call, hospitals are much better prepared for any potential COVID resurgence that become even more efficient in the allocation of resources to meet the needs of all patients. While we certainly continue to watch closely as the rest of 2020 plays out, we remain optimistic heading into 2021. And as you might expect, anticipate to deliver robust double-digit sales growth. Moving on to a few comments related to the 2021 P&L. Consistent with sales, we also anticipate strong comparative year-over-year earnings per share. This is in part due to the 2020 dynamics but also in part due to the strength of our businesses. At this time, we anticipate that operating margin will be more in the range of where we ended 2019. For R&D, we will continue to invest for the long-term and anticipate that level of spend to be in the same range of approximately 14% of sales, consistent with prior years. Lastly, it's important to note that we are committed to the incremental investment necessary to advance our pipeline, inclusive of the negative impact to EPS related to the Momenta acquisition, and that in 2021, the impact to EPS is approximately dilution of $0.10 to $0.15 as we disclosed at the deal signing. We remain confident in our strength heading into 2021 and optimistic in our long-term outlook. I want to thank the business leaders joining our call today, Jennifer, Ashley, Thibaut and Mathai to engage in the Q&A session. In fact, I'm going to take the liberty of kicking off this portion of the webcast with the topic that we are often asked, that being the impact of COVID-19, not only this year but what we anticipate for 2021 by requesting each of these leaders to provide a few brief comments on their respective businesses. And then we'll have Mathai address the state of our vaccine candidate development. Jennifer, let's start with you. And David, with respect to Pharmaceuticals, I do think that we could see acceleration. So, the in-line portfolio continues to perform extremely well as we've seen. We're getting nice uptake in some of our larger products, notably STELARA in UC, which was recently an approval we acquired, TREMFYA for PSA. I would also point to some of the filings that we anticipate here in the near-term with respect to the CAR-T BCMA as well as amivantamab for non-small cell lung cancer, potentially on the horizon and part of the mix in 2021. I will also point out that while this quarter was strong, we still have some impact in all three segments related to COVID-19 dynamics. So, there's probably 2 to 3 points of growth that hampered the third quarter reported results. As you can imagine, there's still a segment of the population that's a little bit cautious about going out in public, having their normal office visits. So, I would anticipate that should come back as therapeutics, as vaccines, as people know more about the virus itself. So, it wouldn't be beyond our expectation to think that Jennifer and her team could do even better in 2021. Chris, thanks for the questions. I'll take the first question around margins, and then I'll turn it over to Jennifer to give some thoughts with respect to an outlook to the extent we can provide on pharmaceutical pricing. So, with margins, in my commentary, I referenced, we should be around 2019 operating margin levels, that would exclude other income. So, it would exclude the ASP divestiture gain that you've referenced. Our operating margin for 2019 was 31.3%. We expect to get back to that level. We're going to continue to invest in our pipeline. Recall, too, that in our projections for 2021, we're looking at the Momenta transaction, which was dilutive by as much as $0.15. So that's part of the mix. But I would say, Chris, to probably best labelled, if I was to label them as normal operating margins, we expect to grow our bottom line slightly faster than our top line in most years. And so, I think we'll continue to look to do that with respect to the portfolio and our investment capacity, but not compromising the long-term at any point in time. Great. Thank you, Chris, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining today's call to discuss our third quarter results and your very thoughtful questions. I'd also like to take a moment to just thank the Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their unrelenting commitment to deliver for patients and all of our stakeholders around the world. Don't forget to mark your calendars to join us for our virtual medical device update on Thursday, November 19. Best wishes for continued safety and health and know that we will responsibly provide relevant, transparent updates as warranted. Bye for now."

            "content": "Thank you, Ashley, and good morning to all of you on the call. As you heard from Chris, this quarter, again, we have seen that our consumer brands have been very resilient during this unprecedented time. Our Consumer Health sector grew at 33% operationally in the quarter, delivering a 3.4% operational growth on a year-to-date basis, while continuing to expand our margins and this is a testament to the strength of strategy of offering differentiated science-based brands focused on personal health and those by professionals. So in today's environment, consumers globally have heightened interest in personal health and hygiene, and it's driving high demand for efficacious trusted solutions backed by science, like those offered by Johnson & Johnson. And an example of that preference would be the tremendous growth we have seen in our over-the-counter medicine business driven by brands like TYLENOL, ZYRTEC, PEPCID and ZARBEE'S, or in our oral care franchise with LISTERINE mouthwash. In other parts of our business like skin health and beauty, results have been more nuanced. We have seen a negative impact of COVID-19 in categories like sun care and makeup removers, while seeing increased demand for body wash, body lotions or premium hair care. So for 2021, we expect both headwinds and tailwinds as we saw this year. But we strongly believe that our strategy, our capabilities and our focus on execution position us very well for continued performance. We are prepared to see ongoing fluctuation in consumer demand related to the pandemic, potential pantry loading behaviors or lower incidence of conditions like cold and flu. However, even with these uncertainties in mind, we expect to see continued strong growth in e-commerce and continued demand for our leading brands with efficacy is backed by science, resulting in our Consumer Health business to continue to grow competitively with the market in 2021. And with this, let me hand over to Mathai Mammen. Thanks, Jennifer. Maybe I can take the question on the EGFR-cMet antibody amivantamab. It is a really exciting project for us. You asked about near-term and long-term. First on the antibody itself, it's a really interesting antibody. It's unique to us and it incorporates both EGFR binding peak and the CMS binding peak and CMS is common resistance mechanism for EGFR therapy. So it's both the primary mutation and the resistance mechanism at the same time. The near-term plan is to go forward with an Exon 20 EGFR tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, there are really no good opportunities for patients with Exon 20 signatures. But that's how we will begin but our eyes are on the larger EGFR mutation market and patients in non-small lung cancer. So with time, we plan on exploring multiple lines of therapy and eventually all EGFR containing tumors."

            "name": "Jennifer Taubert",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It's really nice to have the opportunity to speak with you today. I'd like to start by acknowledging all those who have been and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. I sincerely hope that you and those closest to you, remain healthy and safe. I'm really proud of the Pharmaceuticals group performance in the third quarter. We know that illnesses don't hit pause just because there's a global pandemic. So whether battling cancer, facing mental health challenges or living with an autoimmune disease, patients rely on our transformational medicines every single day. As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business grew 4.6% operationally in the third quarter, and we delivered our 10th consecutive quarter with sales that exceeded $10 billion and our second quarter with sales exceeding $11 billion. 7 of our key brands grew at double-digit rates, including our oncology brands, ERLEADA, DARZALEX and IMBRUVICA; our immunology brands, STELARA and TREMFYA; and our pulmonary hypertension brands OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And despite the pressures that COVID-19 placed on our business, our growth year-to-date is roughly 6%, definitely above market growth. During the third quarter, we kept a relentless focus on innovation and on delivering for our patients and customers around the world. So we worked really hard to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio of marketed medicines. We delivered on our pipeline of transformational medicines, and we advanced our next wave of innovation. In Q3, we continued the very successful launch of DARZALEX FASPRO, which is our subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX to treat multiple myeloma and we received approvals for SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. And we filed UPTRAVI IV for pulmonary arterial hypertension and DARZALEX for light chain amyloidosis. And on October 1, we closed our acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, which provides a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth through expansion into and leadership in autoantibody-driven diseases. 2020 has been an unprecedented year, and we've adapted our business to meet the new challenges that have been posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We quickly transitioned to scaling omni-channel capabilities to engage with healthcare providers. We enabled patients to both start and stay on therapy using virtual tools and we deployed a number of technologies to help keep our clinical trials on track. And despite some negative impact related to COVID-19 in the quarter, we also saw encouraging signs of recovery in our market performance across multiple metrics. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, and we feel confident in our ability to grow above the market on a full year basis in 2020. And also our expectations of where our business is heading remain unchanged, and we continue to plan for another strong year of above market growth in 2021.  So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today, and I look forward to any questions. But first, let me go ahead and turn it over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley? Chris, it's Jennifer. I can jump in on the pricing one. So, whether it's based on unemployment trends or whether it's based on healthcare reform, we do see that there is going to be continued pressure on pricing across the pharma industry. I think an important reminder is that for us, our growth is all based on volume, not price. So, we think relative to our competitive set, that we are very well positioned for this future environment. We work very, very hard to develop robust value propositions and to be able to get appropriate value for our products in the market, and we'll continue to do so. But whether it's through healthcare reform efforts, which actually we think could ultimately have a positive if it can help lower patient out-of-pocket costs or through other channel mix and dynamics, we do think that there will be continued pressure there. And then if we talk about INVEGA SUSTENNA, we are very confident in our IP positions around our long-acting injectable portfolio, whether we're talking about INVEGA SUSTENNA, whether we're talking about INVEGA TRINZA, those products bring significant benefit to patients with schizophrenia. And so Larry, as you noted, we do have the bench trial that's starting, but that we feel good in our position there and that those assets are going to continue to be able to deliver not only for patients with schizophrenia, but also for Janssen and for Johnson & Johnson. Yes. And then it's Jennifer. I'll jump in on the immunology front. So immunology, as you know, is our largest business for the Janssen franchise and continues to deliver very, very strong growth. And both STELARA and TREMFYA delivered very solid quarters. STELARA is showing very significant gains globally in both Crohn's Disease and in the ulcerative colitis launch. And very importantly, just this week, we have 5-year long-term remission data in Crohn's Disease that is actually being presented publicly, which we think is another great catalyst and demonstration of the significant benefits that STELARA offers to patients in the GI space. From a TREMFYA perspective, we've got very strong growth and competitiveness as we continue to launch into not only psoriasis, but now also psoriatic arthritis, which we think is going to be a great catalyst, not only for psoriatic arthritis, but also for the psoriasis business. And right now with TREMFYA, we're the only IL-23 that has that psoriatic arthritis indication and hopefully, as you know, we're also studying it for GI applications and our Crohn's Phase 2 data was actually presented this week as well at the United European Gastroenterology Week. So using our IL-23 pathway strategy, we're not only developing TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but also taking it into the GI space where we believe that we're going to be able to benefit even more patients because there's still so much unmet medical need there. Now you've referenced Momenta, and we were really excited to both announce that deal and to close that deal in a very short timeframe. And that acquisition is going to give us the opportunity to enter into the autoantibody space, where we believe for nipocalimab, we've got as many as 10 or more indications that we're going to be able to go into to really transform autoantibody-related diseases. And just about all of these are very underserved, in many cases, we'll be able to be first-in-class, and we believe, best-in-class, and we think this is going to be a really significant catalyst for us. We've also got a number of other assets in the immunology portfolio, the one we brought in bermekimab from XBiotech. We've got other novel mechanisms that are being developed in GI applications, and we'll look forward to really unveiling the true breadth of our immunology pipeline when we have our Analyst Day in 2021. But so let me come back to your question on REMICADE. REMICADE, I think we can anticipate continued relatively similar declines going forward as that product is very, very late in its life cycle. But please know across the breadth of our immunology portfolio, we have got a ton of strength there and are really planning on continuing -- having that be one of our leading franchises for the Janssen business globally. So when we look on the pharma side, so we continue to see improving new-to-brand trends. For some of the assets, there's still a little bit below pre-COVID levels as patients are just getting back in for the diagnosis and the workups and everything to ultimately get diagnosed and then treated. But as we take a look at total demand, most of our brands and as we're looking across the market, are really back to and above pre-COVID levels. And we're definitely seeing stability and some growth in that area. I think while new-to-brand has still been a bit depressed, what we're seeing is higher rates of refills, higher rates of persistency and lower rates of switch. And so they sort of compensate for each other. And so we've been really pleased with the recovery that we've seen. We think that our customers as well are really adapting and figuring out how to use a combination of both telehealth as well as in-person visits depending upon the actual patient and potential diagnosis and we see very positive trends going forward. And should there be any type of second wave, we think that they're going to be much better able to handle that in the second wave than what we saw originally. Sure. So a couple of points. So first, our industry is demonstrating really heroic and historic leadership during this public health crisis. And between everything that, the R&D teams and manufacturing teams are doing around the clock to help bring forward new vaccines and new treatments, as well as what the commercial teams are doing to be prepared to both be able to supply these products in the marketplace but also make sure that there's going to be a receptive audience and demand, people actually wanting to get these vaccines once they get to market. There's a lot of work that's underway there now. What I can say is, as an industry group, we really have come together. And in working with our local industry associations, be they bio or pharma in the U.S., be at IFPMA ex-U.S., there's a lot of work that's underway to help develop and build vaccine confidence across the board by different types of audiences. So everything from making sure that providers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, people who would be involved in the administration have accurate information and information that they can use with their patients, because they're viewed so positively to broad campaigns, to even very targeted local campaigns to get add on specific minority populations, who otherwise might not be as receptive. All of this work is currently underway and I think you can look forward to many types of different campaigns to enroll all of the appropriate folks at the appropriate time, once we have greater line of sight into when these products will actually be able to reach the market.  But safe to say everybody realizes the vaccine confidence is really, really key. And there's a lot of great work that that's being done and more to come on that as we're able to start unveiling it as the products get closer to the market and emergencies authorizations. Yes. And in terms of our working with the agency, we've had a really good track record over the past few months, really during the height of COVID and continuing to submit files, have them accepted and really importantly, get approvals, not only on time but actually ahead of time. So as an example, our DARZALEX FASPRO formulation, our subcu form for multiple myeloma was actually approved ahead of schedule. We had an IMBRUVICA new indication. As you know, we've got 11 indications now for IMBRUVICA. And we had 1 of the new ones there approved ahead of time. I mentioned TREMFYA PSA in that approval. And I could go on and list others, but we continue to have very productive conversations with the FDA and continue to have our products moving through the pipeline as anticipated, and in some cases, even faster than planned."

            "name": "Mathai Mammen",
            "content": "Thank you, Thibaut. Let me now give you a brief update on our COVID-19 vaccine. First, a reminder of a bit of background. On the heels of some really promising Phase 1 and 2a data, we initiated a single dose Phase 3 study called ENSEMBLE a few weeks ago on September 21 in the United States, and we're in the process of opening numerous sites globally. Our vaccine, as a reminder, is based on Ad26. This is a human adenovirus and contains a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our vaccine was shown to elicit a robust immune response in humans as demonstrated by the presence of neutralizing antibodies in T cells. I'd like to now elaborate on the statement we posted on our website yesterday regarding a temporary pause in further dosing in our COVID vaccine clinical trials. First, some context. It's not at all unusual for unexpected illnesses that occur in large studies over their duration. In some cases, they're called serious adverse events or SAEs, and may have something or nothing to do with the drug or vaccine being investigated. However, as a company that always puts safety first, we take each and every case seriously. In certain cases, when we need more information, we pause the enrollment and dosing of additional participants as we take the time to gather more information. We have a very defined and well thought due process at J&J that follows high standards of scientific, medical and ethical factors, and we followed all of that to the letters here. First, preliminary information is sent to an independent data and safety monitoring board or DSMB. DSMB, as you know, are very commonly part of trials in the pharmaceutical industry. This board is comprised of outside experts who evaluate the information and then make a recommendation to us. In our case here, we were informed of an unexpected illness on Sunday evening October 11, and we followed our process exactly and quickly and posted a statement on our website the following day on Monday, October 12 pausing enrollment. The DSMB was informed immediately on Sunday, and they've requested additional information. We're now awaiting further medical information and evaluation, which we will then forward to the DSMB for their independent recommendation. We're absolutely committed to providing transparent updates throughout our vaccine development program, and we will update you when we lean more. And finally, I'd like -- I would be remiss if I didn't express great enthusiasm for the R&D portfolio at Janssen. I'm very excited with all the really tremendous progress we made against the programs in our portfolio in spite of COVID-19, continue to make deep investments and terrific progress on currently marketed products to extend them further and against new molecular entities. Highlights were already mentioned that include DARZALEX FASPRO for AL amyloidosis, progress as we continue to build on TREMFYA, amivantamab, our CD3 redirector franchise, BCMA CAR-T, RPGR gene therapy and many others. So happy to address any of that in the Q&A. I'll hand it now back to Chris DelOrefice. Chris? So, we know very little information right now. We've given our information set that we do know to the DSMB, and they've asked a number of specific questions. We don't know whether they haven't informed us. They have the right to unblind. We are still blinded. So we don't know treatment arm, vaccine arm. We know very little at this point. And it will be a few days at minimum for the right set of information to be gathered and evaluated. Sure. So in terms of the vaccine overall, like as soon as we overcome this temporary pause. Our plan is to continue to pursue studies that were on route. And the vaccine efficacy -- specifically was your question, all statistical analysis plan assume something and we've assumed 70% vaccine efficacy for this trial. But of course, based on the Phase 1/2a data, we're very bullish on that or better efficacy. So, if we happen to see better efficacy than that, what will happen, we'll see events -- will -- as they come in, will show a greater imbalance between placebo and vaccine. And we have a chance to finish even faster. And so that's how it'll manifest, we just assume something for the moment. But that doesn't actually dictate how the study is conducted. Yes, vaccine question. So this interaction right now we're having with regulators and DSMB doesn't change our manufacturing process or plans at all. And we're well underway with our program right now, and we're looking forward to getting going. Our overall plans are to complete recruitment of the [50,000] subjects in 2 or 3 months, and that remains on track."

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the second quarter of 2020. I hope everyone is healthy and continues to remain safe during these times.  Joining me on the call today to address Johnson & Johnson's response to the global coronavirus pandemic, along with our second quarter results, are Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joaquin Duato, Vice Chairman of Executive Committee, will also join Paul, Joe and myself.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.  Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date.  Our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures, are also available at investor.jnj.com.  Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.  Moving to today's agenda. I will cover consolidated and segment sales information, along with some operational highlights from the P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Next, Paul will provide an update on our vaccine platform, including our efforts to develop and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine. Finally, Joe will conclude by providing insights on our cash position and how we think about our capital allocation during this time. He will then provide an update on our full year guidance. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes.  Worldwide sales were $18.3 billion for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 10.8% versus the second quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, decreased 9% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. In the U.S., sales decreased 8.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported decline was 13.4%. However, operational sales decline outside the U.S. was 9.6% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 3.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales decline was 8.8% worldwide, 8.1% in the U.S. and 9.4% outside the U.S.  Results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we did see improvement throughout the quarter as countries and states began to reopen. China, for example, returned to growth in the second quarter, led by a strong rebound of our Medical Devices segment.  Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.36 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.08 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $4.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.67, representing decreases of 36% and 35.3%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 34.5%.  Beginning with Consumer Health, I would now comment on business segment sales performance for the second quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. I will also be providing additional insights using our best estimates on the impacts of COVID-19 to our performance in the areas where it had the largest influence.  Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.3 billion, declining 3.6%, with operational growth in the U.S. of 1.3% and a decline outside the U.S. of 7.4%. Our Consumer Health segment realized a negative estimated impact associated with COVID-19 of about 700 basis points. This impact was the result of consumers stocking products during the first quarter and lower consumption due to government lockdowns during the second quarter. Our year-to-date growth was 3.6% and normalizes for some of the timing of consumer stocking that occurred in the first quarter.  Excluding the negative impact of COVID-19, our Consumer Health segment delivered solid performance, with continued strong performance in our U.S. OTC and Oral Care businesses. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally almost 11%, with about 30% growth in the U.S. and a 5% decline outside the U.S... In the U.S., we estimate about 2/3 of the growth was due to the COVID-19 pandemic as we continue to see strong demand and share gains for Adult Tylenol. Additional brands driving growth include U.S. PEPCID due to share gains from a competitive withdrawal from the market and continued strong performance of Zarbee's Naturals. Outside the U.S., declines were primarily driven by COVID-19 restrictions, most notably in China, partially offset by an increase in antismoking consumption.  Our Oral Care franchise was positively impacted by COVID-19 as the franchise grew 6.3% from strong demand of Adult Listerine primarily in the U.S. across multiple channels. Growth outside of the U.S. was also driven by Asia Pacific from promotional activities and new product launches of Adult Listerine.  The Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined 14.3% and was the franchise that was most negatively impacted by COVID-19 due to changes in consumers' skin health and beauty routines. The U.S. declined by 19.2% from reduced consumption of sun care, cosmetics and facial care products, impacting the NEUTROGENA and AVEENO brands. Outside the U.S., our Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined by 8.2%, primarily from the COVID-19 impact in Asia Pacific and SKU rationalization initiatives in EMEA.  And in our remaining Consumer Health franchises, Baby Care, Women's Health and Wound Care/Other all declined primarily due to COVID-19. Global Baby Care declined 11.6% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. The U.S. grew when you exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture, primarily due to increased COVID-19 demand. The COVID-19 increased demand in the U.S. was more than offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 outside the U.S., primarily in Asia Pacific. The slower performance outside the U.S. was also negatively impacted by the SKU rationalization program and lapping of Johnson's restaged launch in EMEA. Globally, we continue to see strong growth in AVEENO Baby.  Moving on to the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.8 billion grew 3.9%, enabled by growth across all regions and in all key therapeutic areas, except for the cardiovascular, metabolism and other therapeutic area, due primarily to biosimilar competition on PROCRIT. We realized double-digit growth in 8 key products. Sales grew in the U.S. by 5.8% and outside the U.S. by 1.4%.  Our growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by COVID-19, driven by delayed diagnosis and slower new patient starts due to office closures and access to physician-administered drugs as well as the phasing impact of stocking in the first quarter. The products most impacted by COVID-19 were DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, STELARA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and our pulmonary hypertension portfolio. And we estimate impact on these products to be worth roughly 300 to 350 basis points to our worldwide Pharmaceutical growth. Despite this impact, global operational growth for the first half of the year is strong at 7%, which remains above expected market growth. While not significant in total, our second quarter results did include favorable prior period pricing adjustments in the U.S. to XARELTO and INVOKANA, partially offset by a negative adjustment to STELARA.  Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 5.7%. Our prior year results included a favorable onetime adjustment for DARZALEX related to the completion of pricing and reimbursement discussions in certain European countries. Excluding this impact, growth for the total oncology portfolio was about 9% for the quarter or 15% on a year-to-date basis.  DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 18.8% globally. Excluding the previously mentioned onetime adjustment, worldwide growth was about 33%. And excluding the negative impact of COVID-19, we estimate that DARZALEX growth would have been more in line with previous quarters. The U.S. grew 32.9% with strong growth across all lines of therapy, driven by the new frontline indications for multiple myeloma. During the quarter, we launched a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and Europe, an innovative fixed-dose formulation, which can be administered in 3 to 5 minutes and offers a clinically meaningful reduction in infusion and administration-related reactions. We are pleased with the uptake of this new product and the benefit it provides to our patients and health care providers.  IMBRUVICA grew 17% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth, primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U.S., along with strong uptake outside the U.S. While negatively impacted by delayed diagnosis and the reversal of Q1 stocking related to COVID-19 in the quarter, IMBRUVICA growth year-to-date is strong at over 25% as IMBRUVICA remains the best-in-class BTK inhibitor and is the new and total patient share leader in CLL line 1, CLL line 2+ and MCL line 2+.  ERLEADA continued its strong launch trajectory with sales more than doubling versus prior year. During the quarter, we presented results at the Annual ASCO Conference from the final analysis of the pivotal Phase III SPARTAN study, demonstrating that ERLEADA significantly improved overall survival in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Slightly offsetting these results were declines in ZYTIGA and VELCADE, primarily due to generic competition.  Moving now to immunology. Globally, sales grew 3% in the second quarter, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. Internationally, sales grew double digits at 11%, offsetting a slight decline in the U.S. of under 1%. Second quarter growth for our immunology portfolio as well as the overall market was impacted by COVID-19-related delayed diagnosis, access and the impact of first quarter stocking. Year-to-date, immunology growth is 7.9% worldwide and U.S. growth is 5.1%.  STELARA growth of about 10% was driven by continued share gains in Crohn's disease with about a 7-point share increase in the U.S. and growth from the recently approved ulcerative colitis indication. STELARA growth was negatively impacted by a prior period price adjustment impacting growth by over 250 basis points globally and was negatively impacted by COVID-19. On a year-to-date basis, STELARA growth remains strong at about 20% globally.  TREMFYA, the first-in-class market-leading IL-23 inhibitor therapy, grew 46% globally and achieved roughly a 10% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 3 points from the second quarter of 2019. We are excited to share that TREMFYA received FDA approval earlier this week for adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.  Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of about 14% from share loss due to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing almost 9%, led by double-digit U.S. growth of 13.8% due to market growth in the U.S., along with share gains for INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA. We continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO, where the unmet need remains high.  In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 4.7%, led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and Juluca for HIV, partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products.  Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio posted double-digit growth of 15%, driven by strong growth of OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI of 17.6% and 39.5%, respectively, driven by increased market penetration and share growth.  I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $4.3 billion, declining by 32.7% due to the negative impact of COVID-19 restricting elective procedures across all regions. Sales declined in the U.S. by 39.6% and declined 26.4% outside the U.S. Given the negative impact of COVID-19 across all platforms, my commentary will focus on key trends in each platform. As expected, our Q2 results included 1 additional selling day versus prior year, positively impacting results by about 50 basis points. We expect a minor benefit in Q3 from selling days.  Interventional Solutions declined by 20.5% globally, with a U.S. decline of 30.5% and an OUS decline of 10.9%. Interventional Solutions saw improvement throughout the quarter, returning to growth in June at almost 3%. China had a particularly strong recovery, growing double digits in the quarter. The U.S. returned to growth in June, led by electrophysiology performance. Procedures in electrophysiology over the last 2 weeks of the month averaged 91% of pre-COVID levels across the U.S., with the Northeast part of the country recovering at the slowest rate, primarily due to the New York City metro area.  Orthopedics declined by 33.9% in the quarter due to market declines from restrictions on deferrable procedures and reductions in general activity such as travel and recreation that negatively impacted trauma. The U.S. saw the largest recovery of all regions, with June declining less than 8% versus prior year as U.S. hips grew high single digits and U.S. trauma was flat. Knees and spine also showed improvement globally throughout the quarter with June declines of around 21% and 15%, respectively. For the quarter, U.S. pure price improved slightly versus previous quarters across all platforms.  Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery declined by 22.9%, with worldwide energy and endocutters declining about 27% for the quarter and less than 20% in the month of June. Biosurgery declined less than 13% in Q2 as results were positively impacted by almost 9 points due to the recovery from the SURGIFLO stopped shipment in Q2 2019. Biosurgery returned to growth in the month of June, led by the U.S. and Asia Pacific.  General Surgery declined 39.5%. In addition to the negative impact of COVID-19, global sales were negatively impacted by 10 points due to an unfavorable prior period pricing adjustment in the U.S. The impact was primarily related to COVID-19, providing enhanced insight into the level and mix of inventory in our distributor channel, resulting in the need to increase our reserves. Wound closure declined almost 28% for the quarter, with June declining 17%.  Vision declined by 39.3% in total, with contact lenses declining 33.6% and surgical declining 55.2%. Contact lenses was negatively impacted by COVID-19, which resulted in less new wearers entering the category due to the shutdown of optical stores and lower consumption for existing wearers as people spent more time at home. The e-commerce channel, which primarily serves existing wearers, is estimated to have a slight decline versus the second quarter of prior year, representing significant outperformance compared to other channels. Contact lens performance is recovering overall as geographies start to open back up, with June declining approximately 26% versus prior year.  I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $1.67 reflects a reported decline of 35.3% and an operational decline of 34.5%.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged, primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed cost deleveraging in the Medical Devices business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins declined, driven by the negative impact of Medical Device sales, partially offset by favorable segment mix, expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business and optimized brand marketing expenditures in the Consumer Health business.  We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the second quarter 2019 by 180 basis points, driven by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Device sales and segment mix.  The other income and expense line showed net expense of $24 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the net income of $1.7 billion last year. This was primarily driven by the ASP divestiture gain of $2 billion in the second quarter of 2019.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate declined from 20.4% in the second quarter of 2019 to 8% in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of recording additional adjustments to the transitional provision of Swiss tax, which benefited the rate by approximately 7.5 points. We expect no further adjustments to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform and encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.7% versus 19.3% in the same period last year, primarily driven by Swiss tax reform adjustments.  Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2020, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise declined versus the second quarter of 2019 to 29.1%. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Pharmaceutical margins improved by 250 basis points to 44.1%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and selling and marketing expense leveraging. Medical Devices declined to 1.2%, driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including significant sales declines coupled with continued overhead cost and idle manufacturing expenses. Additionally, 2019 results included the gain of approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. Consumer margins improved by 310 basis points to 24%, driven by planned prioritization and optimization of brand marketing expenses.  That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter 2020. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Paul.\nPaulus Stoffels: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our vaccine program, particularly our progress on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.  As you know, we announced our lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate on March 30. And since then, we have made significant progress. We have seen strong preclinical data so far, which were published in the Journal of Science in May. These data validated the preclinical vaccine challenge model and showed that prototype DNA vaccines were able to create strong immunity. Based on these data and interactions with regulatory authorities, we were able to accelerate the clinical development program of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Since then, we have initiated a study of a final Ad26 vaccine candidate in nonhuman primate challenge model. These results will be published in a major scientific journal in the coming weeks.  Based on this total package of results, we are very comfortable moving forward with Phase I/IIa studies later this month. This represents an acceleration of our time line from our original date of September to the end of July. These studies will establish both the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate as well as evaluate the single dose and the booster dose regimen. The trials will be conducted in more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years as well as adult aged 65 years and older. Our study sites are located in the U.S. and Belgium.  We are also planning for a Phase II study in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany and plan to conduct a Phase I study in Japan. We anticipate the initiation of the trial on July 22 in Belgium and the following week in the U.S. We are also in discussions with the National Institute of Health with the objective to start a Phase III clinical trial ahead of its original schedule, potentially in late September, to evaluate the effectiveness of our vaccine. We are using epidemiology data to predict and plan where our study should take place. We also announced that, in parallel with the clinical development, we are working to expand our global manufacturing capacity to be able to deliver more than 1 billion doses of our COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021. We have made excellent progress on this front as well.  In addition to building out our internal manufacturing capabilities, we entered into collaborations with Emergent BioSolutions and Catalent Biologics and others to support commercial manufacturing of the vaccine. As you have heard me say previously, our COVID-19 vaccine program is leveraging Janssen's adenovector technology that provides the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates. The same technology was used to construct our HIV, RSV and Zika vaccine candidates.  And to develop our Ebola vaccine regimen, we just received marketing authorization from the European Commission for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. The EMA approval is the culmination of work that begun in response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014. Achieving major regulatory approval in this time frame is a tremendous accomplishment. The approval marks the first major regulatory approval of a vaccine developed by Janssen, confirming the potential of our adenovector technology. To date, more than 80,000 people have been vaccinated using this vaccine technology.  As we have previously shared, we are also working on an HIV vaccine and are pleased to report that we have reached an important milestone. Earlier this month, our Imbokodo trial, taking place across Sub-Saharan Africa, reached an important milestone with all people having completed all study vaccination despite difficult COVID-19 circumstances. And we expect the outcomes of this study in the next 2 years. Together with our partners at the NIH and The Gates Foundation, we now have the most advanced HIV candidate in clinical development. These recent milestones strengthen our confidence in our vaccine technology.  The work we are doing today to help address the COVID-19 pandemic built on more than 130 years of Johnson & Johnson's leadership in public health. We believe we have a responsibility to step in and invest in solutions for global public health crisis and are proud to be contributing to the global response to COVID-19. Our efforts to expedite the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and to identify potential treatments are enhanced by multiple collaborations with government, academia, health authorities and others worldwide. And we are working with them to ensure the broadest possible access to people around the world. Thank you.  Joe, I will now turn it over to you.\nJoseph Wolk: Thank you, Paul, not only for that encouraging update, but to you and your team for leading the rapid and responsible advancement of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It is one of many actions that illustrate how Johnson & Johnson is deploying our range of capabilities to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic as we aspire to do across health care for patients and consumers who count on us each and every day.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and those close to you continue to be safe and healthy. While the second quarter was strong relative to expectations, the main message my colleagues and I want you to take away from today's call is that the long-term fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson's business remains strong and our expectations of where the business is heading have not changed. An indicator of that strength is our balance sheet, so let me briefly touch upon our cash position and capital allocation thoughts before getting into guidance commentary.  We ended the quarter in a net debt position of $11 billion, made up of cash and cash equivalents of $19 billion and debt of $30 billion. We did issue commercial paper in the quarter for additional liquidity at favorable interest rates commensurate with our financial strength. Our long-term capital allocation strategy remains intact. We'll continue to prioritize investing in innovation, returning capital to shareholders by paying dividends and increasing them annually, as we have done for 58 years, and then capitalizing on strategic acquisition opportunities that fortify our existing portfolio while simultaneously compensating shareholders for the risks we bear on their behalf.  Earlier, Chris provided specific commentary related to COVID-19 impacts that our business experienced in the second quarter. I will now provide some industry context regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and what that may mean to our business going forward.  With respect to the health care industry, we are encouraged to see many procedures starting to return versus what we saw in the back half of the first quarter across the globe. For example, according to IQVIA, office visits are down approximately 10% to 15% as of late June compared to the earlier stages of the pandemic in mid-April when office visits were down almost 70%. So still down, but showing improvement. This is indicator for our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments.  Johnson & Johnson is developing programs to alleviate patient concerns related to elective surgeries and procedures as well as helping the overall industry treat patients with new public education materials and resources that increase patient confidence and inspire people to prioritize their health. In consumer, based on U.S. Nielsen data, we saw the categories we compete in decline in April by 10%. However, June data suggests those categories declined, but with an improving trend falling just 2% to 3%.  With that high-level backdrop, I will now update you on how we are thinking about performance for the balance of 2020. Our objective with guidance, as always, is to transparently provide information that is useful for you, identifying key assumptions and highlighting factors less clear that may influence our current full year outlook. Similar to our guidance update in April, it is important to caveat that the impact of the pandemic is very fluid and likely to continue evolving over the coming weeks and months. As such, our perspective relies upon numerous internal and external sources to help inform financial projections related to our near-term outlook.  What does that include? Our assumptions consider external expert assessments related to the macro impact of COVID-19 and potential negative consequences it may have on the overall health care system on the number of insured individuals and evolving consumer and patient spending in addition to the frame of mind related to health care behavior when it comes to, for instance, elective procedures and office visits. We are also relying on numerous conversations that Alex, Ashley, and our Medical Device leaders are having with hospital system administrators and surgeons related to capacity, the preparedness for potential spikes of the virus, the improvements that have been implemented to treat COVID-19 patients and the economics of their institution. Lastly, we review extensive analytics on our business that account for individual weekly hospital trends.  Taking these quantitative and qualitative factors into account, let's delve into our updated 2020 guidance, beginning with our Pharmaceutical business. Our expectations for our Pharmaceutical business remain unchanged. In Q2, we did experience reduced patient interactions with health care providers which impacted new patient starts and lower activity for physician-administered drugs, but we are seeing improvement in recent weeks for those areas. You may recall Q1 was very strong, with a modest piece of that strength attributable to pharmacy providers offering longer prescription durations, which slightly impacted Q2 results negatively. All in all, the strength of our Pharmaceutical portfolio that addresses significant patient need gives us confidence to expect above-market growth in 2020 once again.  Regarding our Consumer Health segment. Here, too, we see no changes to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We are off to a fast start in over-the-counter medicines and Oral Care, with those franchises growing year-to-date 2 to 3x versus what we grew in 2019, reflecting some increased COVID-19 demand. As Chris shared, that growth is partially offset by results in other categories, namely skin health/beauty, primarily due to COVID-19. We are proceeding as planned with the SKU rationalization program mentioned in January to improve future operating margins.  Shifting to Medical Devices. Changes from the guidance we offered in April are driven by what we have learned since then. And similar to the first quarter, these assumptions are the most ambiguous at this time. As expected, the medical device industry continues to experience near-term negative impacts while elective procedures are deferred and hospital resources are redeployed to address COVID-19. We assume the most significant negative impact to Medical Devices would occur in the second quarter. That is still our expectation.  In April, based on data available at the time, we assumed a weighted average decline across all markets and all procedures in the second quarter of 40% to 60% versus our original expectations to start the year. As you can see on this slide, total Medical Devices performed better than that assumption as economies around the world began opening sooner than anticipated, but was still down approximately 35% in the quarter. Importantly, we are encouraged by the improvement we saw in each month in the second quarter, with the month of June being down the least at approximately 25% versus our original expectations. Not surprisingly, urgent procedures declined at a lesser rate than procedures considered deferrable.  As we think about the remainder of 2020, the ramp of the recovery is the most difficult variable to estimate. When we provided guidance in April, we expected the impact of COVID-19 in Medical Devices to linger throughout Q2 and Q3 with a recovery in Q4. However as just noted, we experienced a faster recovery than anticipated. And thus, the backlog of patients we originally predicted in Q4 as a result of pent-up demand is now presumed to occur earlier in the year.  Additionally, given China was the first country impacted and Japan and Korea were seeing early success in containing the virus, we bucketed these 3 markets together when providing guidance in April. As you can see, China has been the first market to recover and returned to double-digit growth versus prior year in Q2. However, Japan and Korea saw new cases rise early in the quarter and implemented restrictions, resulting in declines consistent with the rest of total Medical Devices. Similarly, the bucket of countries we defined as major markets saw some countries like Germany outperforming our overall Medical Devices business, whereas other markets such as the U.S. declined 40% versus our original expectations to start the year.  Clearly, the countries bucketed together in our April framework are performing differently from each other and therefore are no longer the best representation of how our business will perform going forward. Additionally, the dynamics within a country can be very different across communities. Our evolving detailed procedural model allows us to forecast at a granular level within each country. As such, we are not relying on the previous regionally based buckets and instead are providing our expectations for Q3 and Q4 for total Medical Devices to provide visibility to the impact in a simplified manner.  In Q3, we now expect a decline of 10% to 25% versus our original expectations to start the year, a smaller decline than we incorporated in our April guidance. In Q4, we are now assuming a decline of 15% to 0%, consistent with my remarks from a moment ago, with the pent-up demand we were anticipating largely occurs throughout quarters 2 and 3. Considering all these factors, we estimate a negative operational sales impact of approximately $3.8 billion to approximately $5.3 billion to the Medical Devices forecast below our original January guidance. While there are many moving parts, the impact on Medical Devices is the sole change to our prior operational sales guidance for the enterprise.  Now we often get asked about a second wave of COVID. Our thinking continues to be that, if that occurs, it should not have the same level of global impact that's been experienced in the last 4 months. This assumption is based on opinions shared by various experts as they believe, as do we, that if this occurs, the world is much better prepared. How so? Testing is more readily available. Remarkably, over 700,000 tests now occur daily in the U.S. alone. There is adequate supply of necessary medical equipment. Isolation and other preventative measures are being implemented quickly with more precision. Treatment protocols continue to improve, and there may be therapeutic options available. Finally, a portion of the population will have developed antibodies. While 1 death is too many, with a rapidly declining death rate related to the virus, the health care system is much better positioned than when the virus first appeared. Therefore, while we actively monitor the rising case rate, our premise is that procedures and doctor visits will be largely permissible in the second half of this year.  So let's summarize our Medical Device outlook. We still estimate the most significant negative impact occurred in Q2, but the impact to both Q2 and Q3 is now expected to be less than what we were anticipating in April. This upside is partially offset in Q4 compared to our April guidance as that predicted bolus of patients is now assumed to have occurred earlier in the year. We are seeing signs of recovery. And while the next few months and quarters contain uncertainty, the long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid. And most importantly, we continue to see tremendous potential over the long term to serve our patients and customers. Given all these factors, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the following. Adjusted operational sales of minus 0.8% to positive 1.0%, incorporating the latest range of negative Medical Device operational sales impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $5 billion versus January guidance. Moving on to operational sales. Our guidance is $81 billion to $82.5 billion or minus 1.3% to a positive 0.5%. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.13, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 130 basis points versus the negative 200 basis points provided in our April guidance, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between minus 2.6% to minus 0.8% compared to 2019 or $79.9 billion to $81.4 billion. We are maintaining our expectation for operating margins with a decline year-over-year of 100 basis points as well as April guidance ranges of net other income and net interest expense. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 is now estimated to be 16.5% to 17.5%, tighter than the previous range.  Given those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $7.85 to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. This reflects an operational or constant currency decline of 9.6% to 7.3%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share versus our April guidance impact of a negative $0.15. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.75 to $7.95, a range of minus 10.7% to minus 8.4%. I know many of you are interested in our thoughts beyond 2020, so I thought I would say a few words on very early thinking on select topics for next year. In our Pharmaceutical business, we don't anticipate new biosimilar or generic competitors and expect another year of above-market performance, largely driven by increased penetration and new indications across our existing diversified portfolio led by key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA. In our Consumer Health business, we will continue to focus on delivering solid growth in our core strongholds of OTC and skin health and continued expansion of the e-commerce channel. In Medical Devices, based on what we know today, we expect procedures to be largely permissible throughout the year. And given COVID-19's impact on 2020, we expect to deliver robust double-digit operational sales growth. Regarding the P&L for 2021. While not providing guidance at this very early stage, I will share that we are expecting other income and expense to be consistent with the guidance I just shared for 2020. In addition, while we continue to manage our portfolio with rigor, emphasizing platforms where we can optimize our success, we are planning to treat future significant divestiture gains as a special item going forward. We would expect to improve operating margins from this year's level given higher sales as well as realizing benefits from our SKU rationalization initiative in Consumer Health. And finally, as a reminder, when comparing revenue next year versus this year, our 2020 fiscal calendar has the benefit of additional 2 to 3 shipping days associated with a 53rd week. Robust plans are being developed and will be finalized as we move throughout 2020. We anticipate strong EPS growth in 2021 on an operational basis given some of the dynamics at play in 2020, and commit to providing updates as appropriate on future earnings calls. Let me conclude prepared remarks with our key developments in the quarter. As we look at our pipeline, we have been able to advance a majority of our portfolio despite COVID-19, but I'd like to highlight a few items. Beginning with the Pharmaceutical pipeline. In addition to the progress Paul referenced on the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we had a number of approvals in the second quarter included on this slide, several ahead of their PDUFA dates. Most notable are TREMFYA for active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., DARZALEX for subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU, IMBRUVICA frontline in CLL combo with rituximab in the U.S. and the Ebola vaccine in the EU. We updated our filing time line slightly for our BCMA CAR-T. We remain on track to initiate the U.S. regulatory application by year-end 2020 and have updated timing of the EU submission to early 2021, which accounts for comprehensive manufacturing and commercial plans.  You will also note that we are no longer filing niraparib in line 3 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The data from the Phase II GALAHAD study did demonstrate a highly competitive efficacy and safety profile for niraparib, which supported FDA breakthrough therapy designation. However, recent approvals of other agents in this class have removed the path to gain accelerated approval for niraparib based on this single-arm study. Considering this development, we will not be moving forward with regulatory submissions with GALAHAD, but niraparib remains an important part of our prostate cancer pipeline, with $1-billion-plus revenue potential. Turning to Medical Devices. We continue to advance our innovation agenda with some notable achievements in the quarter, such as: U.S. FDA breakthrough designation for Monarch-enabled NeuWave ablation technology; CE Mark for Heliostar, our single-shot balloon catheter; and CE Mark for QDOT, a microcatheter enabling better lesion treatment, just to highlight a few. We also continued to advance digital surgery offerings. Since launch, there have been over 3,200 lung biopsies completed using the Monarch system. We will also expand the system with multi-specialty applications with endourology next in line for U.S. approval with the treatment of kidney stones, a market that is almost twice the size of the one we are in today. We continue to make great progress towards a second half 2020 U.S. regulatory submission for our orthopedic robotics solution as part of our VELYS digital surgery platform, first in knees, coming out of our acquisition of Orthotaxy. In General Surgery, we will incorporate elements from the general surgery robotic platforms of both Verb and Auris, which we believe enhances our value proposition and increases our ability to create a differentiated platform for surgeons. We continue to have ongoing conversations with regulatory authorities around the world. And based on these conversations, we will not be following a 510(k) regulatory pathway in the U.S. After analyzing time to market compared to overall value proposition, our goal is to initiate first-in-human studies with our robotic solution in the second half of 2022. We continue to be very excited about the overall program and that our continued investment here will offer a differentiated and competitive product to the market with better outcomes for patients. The new time lines are based on what we know today, reflecting a world that is very different than what it was just a few short months ago. One item occurring after the second quarter close and not listed on this slide was Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation's sale of the equity position in Idorsia. As part of the Actelion acquisition in 2017, you may recall that we employed an innovative deal structure resulting in the formation of a new company, which is now established. We remain very excited about our ongoing partnership with Idorsia on assets like Ponesimod and Aprocitentan.  Before I hand the call back to Chris, I want to express our sincere gratitude to our 132,000 associates around the world. Johnson & Johnson's strong foundations begin with their tireless effort and unwavering dedication to elevating the standards of health care. In a tumultuous year, they remain focused on credo values and meeting commitments to patients, doctors and nurses, employees, parents and children, communities and shareholders. Without them, our current and future success would not be possible. Chris, back to you to begin the Q&A portion.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: Just two for me. Can you maybe first talk about -- I think you addressed the potential for a second wave, but any early read in terms of what you're seeing in some of the regions in the U.S. that are seeing a rapid increase in COVID cases? Are those still -- states still seeing a recovery in procedure volumes? Or are you starting to see some slowdown in volumes in some of those regions? And then my second question was on the Vision business and just elaborate on some of the trends and how you're thinking about recovery there. It seems like that's one of the segments of the market that might be seeing a bit of a lagging recovery versus some of your other device businesses. I'm just interested in how you're thinking about that franchise over the coming quarters.\nAlex Gorsky: Chris, this is Alex. Can you hear me okay on the audio?\nChristopher Schott: Yes.\nAlex Gorsky: Okay. Chris, first of all, thank you very much for the question. And look, before I start off answering directly to your question, I just want to continue to acknowledge the great work of our colleagues across Johnson & Johnson, as we just shared with you in the second quarter. And while we're going to be reviewing a lot of statistics and a lot of facts and a lot of figures on the call today, I also think it's always important to acknowledge the direct impact that COVID-19 has had on patients, it's had on family and friends for all of us in some way. And also, I'd be remiss if I didn't do a shout out for the frontline health care workers, the doctors, the surgeons, the nurses, the assistants who have been showing up for the last 5 months dealing with just an unprecedented pandemic, learning real-time and adjusting as necessary, literally working 24/7.  And finally, our own J&J workers, nearly 1/3 of our workforce who have continued to show up to ensure that we could have supply of our products as well as continue the important research and the development, not only on our vaccine, but on so many other therapeutics, devices and consumer products for patients and consumers around the world. So Chris, as I have reached out and been able to connect with CEOs of hospital systems across the United States, but also more broadly with other administrators around the world, as we've taken a look at the data, clearly, we believe that the virus' spread has accelerated, particularly in the South, Southeast, the Southwest and Far West. What we're -- what they are seeing in the hospital right now is clearly a resurgence over the previous rates. Similar to Joe's earlier comments, the general sentiment is that they are better prepared in the hospitals, but it's important to note that, in certain counties, certain cities and localities, be it Dade in Florida, Miami, Palm Beach, areas around Dallas -- excuse me, Houston, San Anton, San Diego, Los Angeles, that the rates are increasing at a very significant rate.  I think the general sentiment is that they are better prepared in terms of the kind of equipment that they have on hand. Testing still depends on where you are. While testing rates have increased dramatically, there are still -- there still remain spottages in particular areas and other areas where hospitals have ramped up their own laboratory capabilities, combined with others. They think that they're getting the results in a reasonable period of time. And of course, they've got better protocols in place in terms of understanding, whether it's treating with dexamethasone, anticoagulants and other approaches that are leading to better outcomes.  I think the things that we're -- they're continuing to watch very closely is the exact incidence rate and how that unfolds in the coming weeks and months, we think it's going to be critical. I mean, thus far, as we alluded to, the death rates and the hospitalization rates have not -- while increasing, have not been the same as we saw very early. But the next few weeks are going to be critical, and obviously, we're going to have to watch that very closely.  And I think something else that the hospitals are keeping a close handle on are the staffing. Because in many cases, just as they were beginning to ramp back up with elective procedures and bring staffing back on. Now they're having to, in many cases, reallocate it based upon the surge that they're seeing take place.  I think the other important factor is they learned a lot about reopening-up their surgical suites and also how to create additional space for ICU and CCU patients. They've seen some of the detrimental effect of these delayed procedures. Therefore, they, as much as possible, want to try to continue ensuring the patients can get access to those procedures even while managing the pandemic. But again, depending on where they are, there have been some areas where they shut down elective procedures and they're managing it based upon the case load they're seeing. So that's an overall response. If I back up just one more step, if we look at the data through the end of June, I think Chris alluded to this in his remarks as well as Joe, across the United States and the majority of the surgical categories that we're operating in, we're seeing about a return to 85% to 90% of what we did in pre-COVID baseline periods. But obviously, we're going to watch that closely as we watch the numbers and the areas I mentioned increase, at least as of late and in the coming weeks.\nJoseph Wolk: Chris, this is Joe. Maybe just to pick up with respect to your questions around Vision Care specifically. So contact lenses was down a little bit over 30% in the quarter. Clearly the impact of COVID-19 as there's just simply less new wearers entering the category due to a shutdown of optical stores, but also lower consumption for existing wearers as people adopt shelter-in-place measures and stay at home. The e-commerce channel, which primarily serves existing wearers, was also down when you compare it to the second quarter of last year. But we are seeing an improved performance. So if you look at June, contact lenses was down almost 25% versus the prior year. So you're seeing that same quarterly improvement throughout -- the monthly improvement throughout the quarter with respect to contact lenses. In terms of Vision Surgical, I would say that's probably one of the most deferrable procedures out there. And so as we start to see elective procedures become more prevalent, we would expect that to return as well.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Chris, I would just add on Vision Care. I think when you think of our contact lens business going forward, we've had consistent strong performance there with at- or above-market performance levels the past 4 years and have had a very strong cadence of innovation 2019, Transition Light Intelligent Technology; 2020, we're excited about our ACUVUE Theravision, first anti-allergy contact lens. And then did receive FDA breakthrough device designation on our myopia control lens. So it's a franchise that we feel very strong about going into the future.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Maybe one for Paul on the vaccines and a quick commentary on recovery for Joe. Paul, just to start off on vaccines for a second here, just two quick ones. Our sense is the FDA wanted hundreds of exposures before allowing Phase II trials. So I guess, what's your confidence you're going to have the data needed to start those Phase III trials later this year? And then a lot of investors are focused on sort of humoral versus cellular immunity. I just wonder if you could talk to the durability of neutralizing antibodies and whether we should expect the CD8 response. And frankly, does that matter, in your view? And then a quick recovery comment for Joe.\nPaulus Stoffels: Well first, from experience, to start the clinical trial, we have developed a vaccine platform over the last 6, 7 years. And we have now more than 80,000 people who have been vaccinated by our platform. And that is in RSV, in Zika, in HIV and Ebola. And that gives very good comfort that we have a safe platform. In addition to that, we have been able, in RSV and Zika, to use a high dose, at 110-11, for those who know what it means, is that is the highest dose you can administer, but with almost no fever. So we will be able to administer a very high single dose, which will be enabled in our Zika and in our RSV, will elicit a very strong neutralizing antibody response as well as a cellular immunity response with one single dose. Whether we need to boost for durability, we have learned that in Ebola, we have learned that in others, that maybe yes, but not immediately. We are going to test a boost dose as we start, but we think more that we will have to boost 1 year or 2 years after the single high dose.  So we're going to learn fast. And with a single-dose Phase I study, we should be able to start mid-September with the experience we have, and that's in full discussion with the regulatory authorities around the world.\nJoseph Wolk: David, your second point?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Are you there? On your question on recovery? Operator? Rob, are you there...\nOperator: Yes, I'm here.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Let's move on to the next question. We can always come back to David if need be.\nOperator: Sure. Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: I'll ask one recovery and one vaccine question as well. Just on the recovery, thanks so much for the data, Alex. Just when you talk at the end of June, 85% to 95% of pre-COVID levels and the spike in cases in the South, are you seeing other parts of the world offset that? And so in other words, you're still seeing improvements in trends through mid-July? And then second, for Paul. When are we going to see the initial human clinical data? And you didn't mention when you expect availability of the vaccine. I think your prior comments were maybe early 2021. Are you still going to seek EUA approval based on the Phase I/II trial? Or do you think you'll need the Phase III data for approval?\nAlex Gorsky: Sure, Larry. Let me respond to the first, and then I'll ask Paul obviously to cover the second. Look, the data that we're citing, we're trying to provide the most up-to-date information we had, which basically goes with the data through the latter part of June, I think for the first couple of days in July. And if we look across the world, we see basically most of the -- majority of countries up over 85%. And what I mean by that is if we're tracking their weekly recovery rate and we compare that to pre-COVID period and we adjust for that over a several-week period, those numbers are in the, I would say, north of 80% to 85% range.  The one outlier to that is the U.K. The U.K. is still below 50%. And again, we're clearly developing the ability to track this, not only on a country and a region basis, but the United States on a -- literally on state, a county and city and individual hospital bases. And again, there are differences at each one of those levels. But at an overall country level, if we take about the top 12 markets around the world, what I'd say is the overwhelming majority of them are north of 85%, with the outlier being the U.K.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Larry, I think on that one, China is a good example where we continue to see very good progress and momentum, with double-digit growth in recent times here in Q2.\nPaulus Stoffels: On your vaccine question, Larry, first, I want to also add to it that neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immunity is important here for -- not just for the response, but also for durability. Our initial data on the Phase I will be available second half of September, which they will be -- become the basis for a Phase III study. And that will start mid to end September, that's the goal. With a large number of people included and a simple design with a single dose, we could have data before the year-end, or at the latest, early next year. And availability of a vaccine will be starting early next year. We'll have some dosages before the year-end which will be used for clinical trials and maybe for other reasons, but the larger quantity will start first quarter of next year. And then in the year, we will deliver up to 1 billion dosage of our vaccine. And all of that is in place. We have the manufacturing sites. We have the filling sites. We have everything what's needed to deliver that 1 billion vaccines and more next year.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks for all you guys are doing to fight COVID. I just had a question on -- following up just on the robotics platform. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more detail. It sounded to me that you were redesigning, if I heard you right, the program to integrate the two systems. Could you just provide a little bit more details on that, and just the timing? I just want to make sure I understood the comments in the prepared remarks.\nAlex Gorsky: Sure, Kristen, this is Alex. First of all, I just want to restate our excitement about the overall digital space. And when we look at the potential of this market currently being less than 5% penetrated. And understandably, that's indicative of some markets in the United States at well over 50% for certain procedures. But on a global basis, we think there's just tremendous growth opportunity. Two, if you just look at the acceleration of technology that we're also seeing, and clearly, that's been the driving force behind our investment, both in Auris, but also our partnership with Verb and Verily. And as we brought those different capabilities, those different technologies together, I think it's actually reinforced the potential and the possibilities that we see in surgery for the future.  And I also think it's important to note that we continue to see really good uptake with our Monarch system. We're going to expand the system with multiple specialty applications, with endourology next in line for U.S. approval for the treatment of kidney stones. And that market in itself is about twice the size of where we are today.  We're making good progress even with -- as our teams deal with the COVID-19 situation on the General Surgery robotic platforms, and that's for both Verb and Auris. We think that it clearly enhances not only the capabilities, but our value proposition and our ability long term to really create and launch a differentiated platform.  As Joe, I believe, Chris may have alluded to earlier in their points, we continue to have ongoing conversations with regulatory authorities around the world. We will not be following a 510(k) regulatory pathway for the U.S. And after analyzing time to market compared to the overall value proposition, look, our goal is to initiate first-in-human studies with our robotic solution in the second half of 2022.  And again, we think there is significant potential. We continue to be impressed by the technology advancements we're seeing with both the Verb and Verily and the Auris combination. Our teams are making very good progress as we speak. And we'll be providing more information as well on our digital, and we'll be providing you some further updates regarding a more focused digital review in the coming months. So stay tuned. But I think we're as excited as ever about the possibility and the potential in this market.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Matt Miksic with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMatthew Miksic: So just one clarification on the recovery side, if I could emphasize this one topic, but it sounds like the fourth quarter expectations came down as you're describing a little bit just on the backlog not being as strong, given the strength and recovery that we saw in June. And are your assumptions for the back half and for Q3, Q4 based on sort of the trends exiting June? And Alex, as you point out, we need to watch carefully over the next several weeks. Is that sort of the setup for the back half?  And then maybe, if that does -- if we pause here at all in the next month or 2, is it fair to say that, I guess, are we looking at making up those -- does the backlog go back up and this sort of brings up Q4, Q1? Is that the right sort of way to think about the flow of procedures? And I have one follow-up for Paul in vaccines.\nJoseph Wolk: So Matt, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. You're thinking about it appropriately. So we took down the fourth quarter simply because that pent-up demand or that backlog that we thought would occur from a deferment of procedures in Q2 and Q3 when we issued guidance in April is, quite frankly, not occurring. That's a good thing for certainly patients, but for the health care system, that there's not some unintended consequences with the deferral of very, very important procedures.  The model going forward is based on the best information we had coming out of June. So yes, it would reflect that. And I think that's probably a fair assumption or premise to say that if we had a slowdown here as cases rise in select areas, that, that slowdown would probably be compensated with an improvement to the outlook for Q4, possibly Q1, depending on how long elective procedures are not permitted.  Again, I do want to emphasize that collectively as a society, as a health care system at large, we're much better prepared. And when there are isolation measures that are put in place, it's much more selective than maybe the universal approach we were looking at back at the end of March or early April. So I think it would be less of an impact, but I don't think it's unfair to think that, that impact, if negative, would come back in a positive way at some point later in the future.\nAlex Gorsky: Matt, this is Alex. I think one other factor that we're going to have to watch closely is also what's happening more broadly with the economy, unemployment and insurance rates and coverage as we head into Q4. And I think, again, the next few weeks and the next couple of months will be very important in determining that, but that's another factor that we're watching. Of course, that's not the case outside the United States. It's over -- about 50% of our business in the U.S., so that's another figure that we're going have to watch closely.\nMatthew Miksic: And then the follow-up -- that's super helpful color -- and on -- for Paul on vaccines. Just it sounds like the immunogenicity is on track as you're moving into first-in-human studies. I guess it may be too early to answer this question, but any color or thoughts at this point on what level of protection this antibody creation can give us at this point? Or what do we know? And what do you expect to learn maybe over the next several months in terms of actual protection?\nPaulus Stoffels: Well, in nonhuman primates and in animal models, you can get to a high level of protection. So we -- it's difficult to extrapolate to humans. But typically, we have a good correlation between animal models in all of our experiments with RSV, HIV, Ebola and Zika. So we should expect significantly above 50%. Well, the barrier is for the FDA, I think you should expect 70%, 80%, in that range at least, and that is also the statistics which will go into the studies. So let's hope we reach that because that could create herd immunity and we could hopefully get a stop -- put a stop to the disease. So let's hope for a very good neutralizing antibody level protecting people at a very high level.\nOperator: Next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nRobert Hopkins: I'll just ask one as a follow-up on the guidance, and thank you for providing that. So just on the fourth quarter guidance for devices, it sounds like the reduction from previous commentary is really just a function, as you said, of better trends in deferred procedures here in Q2 and Q3. I'm curious, does that Q4 guidance that you provided of minus 15% to zero, does that assume a slowdown from current trends due to the spread of COVID in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks? Or are you assuming that your kind of current trends continue? Just want to get a sense for whether you assume, in that 0 to 15%, that things get worse as we go forward or not?\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. So Bob, I would say that it probably looks at trends the way they were occurring more at the end of June. That's the best data -- official data that we had. So we rely on certainly the IHME model, but also studies that are being done and analytics from UCLA, MIT and various other sources.  As Alex mentioned, the outreach that he's had personally, that Ashley has had personally, and other medical device leaders in our company, to the customers themselves to understand what's going on in the ground is probably the most insightful qualitative analysis we put into our modeling, and that's been extremely helpful. So I would say it's largely based on the trends that we saw at the end of June.  And again, I do want to caution folks that while we are seeing a rise in cases, it is in very select communities, in very select states. So again, it's not that same universal approach. And to the size of the business in Medical Devices, it would have a relatively minor impact, in our thinking, should one of those areas slow down versus what the dynamic was at the end of March and early April.\nOperator: Your next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nLouise Chen: So, my first question is just on this new-to-brand prescription pickup. How much of an improvement have you seen? Are there any metrics that you can provide here? And how will it unfold throughout the rest of the year in your mind? And then second question is, how should we think about how much of your increase in your 2020 financial guidance was already captured or incorporated into the second quarter '20 beat?\nJoseph Wolk: Joaquin, maybe you want to answer the new to brand?\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. Thank you. Let me take the new-to-brand data. Overall, what we have seen in both prescriptions and new-to-brand is that they are still below pre-COVID levels, about 9% in overall prescriptions and about 30% in new-to-brand. And I'm talking about market now in general. But what we are seeing is at -- during the quarter, a constant improvement. So, the trends are still improving, and we are seeing particularly positive trends in oncology, where diagnostics visits and IV drug administrations have already returned to the pre-pandemic levels.\nJoseph Wolk: Thanks, Joaquin. And Louise, with respect to your question about how much has already been captured with the second quarter results. I think if you just look purely at the numbers, a lot of the guidance uptake was dependent upon, at least for top line, on the results of the second quarter, specifically in Medical Devices. From our April guidance, we kind of knocked out the worst-case scenario, if you will. And we also saw a little bit of improvement with currency translation as well. With respect to earnings in the bottom line. As you know, I think coming into the call, at least as of Monday's data, it suggests that we beat by roughly $0.20 per share on the bottom line. We've taken our guidance up operationally $0.10 as we're going to continue to look and challenge our teams for good, solid investments for the balance of this year that fortify 2021 and beyond. And that's kind of how we're thinking of this going forward.\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. I would also add that, with respect to our own brands, what we are seeing both in immunology and oncology is that we continue to gain share both in total TRxs and in new-to-brand. For example, when you look at STELARA in Crohn's colonic disease, where year-over-year share gain has been 6.8 points. And when you look at our actual share in overall Crohn's disease is 16%, and our new-to-brand share is 17.7%. So, when you look at our share trends both in immunology and in oncology, in total TRxs and in new-to-brand share, in both cases, we see share gains.\nChristopher DelOrefice: We have time for one more question. Rob, could you introduce the next question, please?\nOperator: Sure, sure. Your next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: I appreciate the early insights on 2021. But just I might have missed it, but any thoughts on how we should think about margins maybe relative -- I know this year is kind of an outlier, but relative to prior years? And then would welcome your latest perspective on any impact you're seeing with respect to payer mix from elevated unemployment and how this might impact 2021. I know, Alex, you touched on this a little bit, but maybe anything you're seeing at this point and how you're thinking about that right now?\nJoseph Wolk: So Terence, I'll answer in terms of operating margin first before turning it over to Joaquin for some of the payer mix. In terms of margins, you -- this right -- that' you're absolutely right. This is a year that's a little bit abnormal, to say the least. So we would expect margin improvement off of this year.  I would point to a number of initiatives that we had already in place that should continue to yield better margins, specifically in our consumer unit, where we did have a SKU rationalization program which should be fully executed by the end of this year. That will help improve margins. And then some broader supply chain initiatives that we had with respect to our partnership with Jabil largely in our Medical Device unit.  So, we would anticipate that there would be margin improvement. We're still going to look to prioritize investment in R&D. I think it was a very strong sign for the company that our level of R&D investment in the second quarter of this year was actually slightly higher than what it was last year. Despite the work-from-home dynamic, we continued to progress our pipeline across all three of our businesses.\nJoaquin Duato: So regarding our payer mix. Just for background, our payer mix now, it's about 50% commercial and about 40% -- 43% Medicare and Medicaid: Medicare being 37%, Medicaid 6%. So a very well-diversified payer mix. At this point, we have not seen any major changes in our payer mix yet. So we have not seen those changes. Depending, as Alex referred before, on the economic recovery and the resulting unemployment rate, we could expect, in the second half of the year, an increase in Medicaid, health exchanges and also uninsured numbers, which will also create affordability problems. But again, at this point, we have not seen changes in our payer mix yet.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Joaquin. Appreciate it. Terence, thank you. And as always, thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest. If we weren't able to get to your question at this time, obviously, please reach out to the Investor Relations team. And then I'll just turn it over to Alex now just for a final comment.\nAlex Gorsky: Well, thank you, Chris. And look, let me end where we started and thank all of you for your ongoing support, and also thank all of our colleagues at Johnson & Johnson who've been working around the clock over the past several quarters to ensure that we can continue to serve all of our credo stakeholders, the patients, the doctors, the surgeons, mothers and fathers that depend on us, that are ensuring that our employees have got a safe environment, the communities where we serve, and ultimately to you, our shareholders.  Hopefully, you also agree that the transparency and the strength of our results in the second quarter reinforce, I think, the core philosophy of Johnson & Johnson, and that in -- whether it be in good times or in challenging times like these, that our strategy, our business model and our value system will ensure that we're able to navigate through in a way that's best for everyone.  So, thank you. We'll -- we're committed to keeping you updated on the progress that we're making in our various programs and as we get more information. And thank you very much, everyone. Stay healthy and stay safe. Bye for now.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson Johnson's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alex Gorsky",
            "content": "Chris, this is Alex. Can you hear me okay on the audio? Okay. Chris, first of all, thank you very much for the question. And look, before I start off answering directly to your question, I just want to continue to acknowledge the great work of our colleagues across Johnson & Johnson, as we just shared with you in the second quarter. And while we're going to be reviewing a lot of statistics and a lot of facts and a lot of figures on the call today, I also think it's always important to acknowledge the direct impact that COVID-19 has had on patients, it's had on family and friends for all of us in some way. And also, I'd be remiss if I didn't do a shout out for the frontline health care workers, the doctors, the surgeons, the nurses, the assistants who have been showing up for the last 5 months dealing with just an unprecedented pandemic, learning real-time and adjusting as necessary, literally working 24/7.  And finally, our own J&J workers, nearly 1/3 of our workforce who have continued to show up to ensure that we could have supply of our products as well as continue the important research and the development, not only on our vaccine, but on so many other therapeutics, devices and consumer products for patients and consumers around the world. So Chris, as I have reached out and been able to connect with CEOs of hospital systems across the United States, but also more broadly with other administrators around the world, as we've taken a look at the data, clearly, we believe that the virus' spread has accelerated, particularly in the South, Southeast, the Southwest and Far West. What we're -- what they are seeing in the hospital right now is clearly a resurgence over the previous rates. Similar to Joe's earlier comments, the general sentiment is that they are better prepared in the hospitals, but it's important to note that, in certain counties, certain cities and localities, be it Dade in Florida, Miami, Palm Beach, areas around Dallas -- excuse me, Houston, San Anton, San Diego, Los Angeles, that the rates are increasing at a very significant rate.  I think the general sentiment is that they are better prepared in terms of the kind of equipment that they have on hand. Testing still depends on where you are. While testing rates have increased dramatically, there are still -- there still remain spottages in particular areas and other areas where hospitals have ramped up their own laboratory capabilities, combined with others. They think that they're getting the results in a reasonable period of time. And of course, they've got better protocols in place in terms of understanding, whether it's treating with dexamethasone, anticoagulants and other approaches that are leading to better outcomes.  I think the things that we're -- they're continuing to watch very closely is the exact incidence rate and how that unfolds in the coming weeks and months, we think it's going to be critical. I mean, thus far, as we alluded to, the death rates and the hospitalization rates have not -- while increasing, have not been the same as we saw very early. But the next few weeks are going to be critical, and obviously, we're going to have to watch that very closely.  And I think something else that the hospitals are keeping a close handle on are the staffing. Because in many cases, just as they were beginning to ramp back up with elective procedures and bring staffing back on. Now they're having to, in many cases, reallocate it based upon the surge that they're seeing take place.  I think the other important factor is they learned a lot about reopening-up their surgical suites and also how to create additional space for ICU and CCU patients. They've seen some of the detrimental effect of these delayed procedures. Therefore, they, as much as possible, want to try to continue ensuring the patients can get access to those procedures even while managing the pandemic. But again, depending on where they are, there have been some areas where they shut down elective procedures and they're managing it based upon the case load they're seeing. So that's an overall response. If I back up just one more step, if we look at the data through the end of June, I think Chris alluded to this in his remarks as well as Joe, across the United States and the majority of the surgical categories that we're operating in, we're seeing about a return to 85% to 90% of what we did in pre-COVID baseline periods. But obviously, we're going to watch that closely as we watch the numbers and the areas I mentioned increase, at least as of late and in the coming weeks. Sure, Larry. Let me respond to the first, and then I'll ask Paul obviously to cover the second. Look, the data that we're citing, we're trying to provide the most up-to-date information we had, which basically goes with the data through the latter part of June, I think for the first couple of days in July. And if we look across the world, we see basically most of the -- majority of countries up over 85%. And what I mean by that is if we're tracking their weekly recovery rate and we compare that to pre-COVID period and we adjust for that over a several-week period, those numbers are in the, I would say, north of 80% to 85% range.  The one outlier to that is the U.K. The U.K. is still below 50%. And again, we're clearly developing the ability to track this, not only on a country and a region basis, but the United States on a -- literally on state, a county and city and individual hospital bases. And again, there are differences at each one of those levels. But at an overall country level, if we take about the top 12 markets around the world, what I'd say is the overwhelming majority of them are north of 85%, with the outlier being the U.K. Sure, Kristen, this is Alex. First of all, I just want to restate our excitement about the overall digital space. And when we look at the potential of this market currently being less than 5% penetrated. And understandably, that's indicative of some markets in the United States at well over 50% for certain procedures. But on a global basis, we think there's just tremendous growth opportunity. Two, if you just look at the acceleration of technology that we're also seeing, and clearly, that's been the driving force behind our investment, both in Auris, but also our partnership with Verb and Verily. And as we brought those different capabilities, those different technologies together, I think it's actually reinforced the potential and the possibilities that we see in surgery for the future.  And I also think it's important to note that we continue to see really good uptake with our Monarch system. We're going to expand the system with multiple specialty applications, with endourology next in line for U.S. approval for the treatment of kidney stones. And that market in itself is about twice the size of where we are today.  We're making good progress even with -- as our teams deal with the COVID-19 situation on the General Surgery robotic platforms, and that's for both Verb and Auris. We think that it clearly enhances not only the capabilities, but our value proposition and our ability long term to really create and launch a differentiated platform.  As Joe, I believe, Chris may have alluded to earlier in their points, we continue to have ongoing conversations with regulatory authorities around the world. We will not be following a 510(k) regulatory pathway for the U.S. And after analyzing time to market compared to the overall value proposition, look, our goal is to initiate first-in-human studies with our robotic solution in the second half of 2022.  And again, we think there is significant potential. We continue to be impressed by the technology advancements we're seeing with both the Verb and Verily and the Auris combination. Our teams are making very good progress as we speak. And we'll be providing more information as well on our digital, and we'll be providing you some further updates regarding a more focused digital review in the coming months. So stay tuned. But I think we're as excited as ever about the possibility and the potential in this market. Matt, this is Alex. I think one other factor that we're going to have to watch closely is also what's happening more broadly with the economy, unemployment and insurance rates and coverage as we head into Q4. And I think, again, the next few weeks and the next couple of months will be very important in determining that, but that's another factor that we're watching. Of course, that's not the case outside the United States. It's over -- about 50% of our business in the U.S., so that's another figure that we're going have to watch closely. Well, thank you, Chris. And look, let me end where we started and thank all of you for your ongoing support, and also thank all of our colleagues at Johnson & Johnson who've been working around the clock over the past several quarters to ensure that we can continue to serve all of our credo stakeholders, the patients, the doctors, the surgeons, mothers and fathers that depend on us, that are ensuring that our employees have got a safe environment, the communities where we serve, and ultimately to you, our shareholders.

Stay healthy and stay safe. Bye for now."

Our sense is the FDA wanted hundreds of exposures before allowing Phase II trials. So I guess, what's your confidence you're going to have the data needed to start those Phase III trials later this year? And then a lot of investors are focused on sort of humoral versus cellular immunity. I just wonder if you could talk to the durability of neutralizing antibodies and whether we should expect the CD8 response. And frankly, does that matter, in your view? And then a quick recovery comment for Joe."

            "content": "Thank you, Paul, not only for that encouraging update, but to you and your team for leading the rapid and responsible advancement of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It is one of many actions that illustrate how Johnson & Johnson is deploying our range of capabilities to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic as we aspire to do across health care for patients and consumers who count on us each and every day.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and those close to you continue to be safe and healthy. While the second quarter was strong relative to expectations, the main message my colleagues and I want you to take away from today's call is that the long-term fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson's business remains strong and our expectations of where the business is heading have not changed. An indicator of that strength is our balance sheet, so let me briefly touch upon our cash position and capital allocation thoughts before getting into guidance commentary.  We ended the quarter in a net debt position of $11 billion, made up of cash and cash equivalents of $19 billion and debt of $30 billion. We did issue commercial paper in the quarter for additional liquidity at favorable interest rates commensurate with our financial strength. Our long-term capital allocation strategy remains intact. We'll continue to prioritize investing in innovation, returning capital to shareholders by paying dividends and increasing them annually, as we have done for 58 years, and then capitalizing on strategic acquisition opportunities that fortify our existing portfolio while simultaneously compensating shareholders for the risks we bear on their behalf.  Earlier, Chris provided specific commentary related to COVID-19 impacts that our business experienced in the second quarter. I will now provide some industry context regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and what that may mean to our business going forward.  With respect to the health care industry, we are encouraged to see many procedures starting to return versus what we saw in the back half of the first quarter across the globe. For example, according to IQVIA, office visits are down approximately 10% to 15% as of late June compared to the earlier stages of the pandemic in mid-April when office visits were down almost 70%. So still down, but showing improvement. This is indicator for our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments.  Johnson & Johnson is developing programs to alleviate patient concerns related to elective surgeries and procedures as well as helping the overall industry treat patients with new public education materials and resources that increase patient confidence and inspire people to prioritize their health. In consumer, based on U.S. Nielsen data, we saw the categories we compete in decline in April by 10%. However, June data suggests those categories declined, but with an improving trend falling just 2% to 3%.  With that high-level backdrop, I will now update you on how we are thinking about performance for the balance of 2020. Our objective with guidance, as always, is to transparently provide information that is useful for you, identifying key assumptions and highlighting factors less clear that may influence our current full year outlook. Similar to our guidance update in April, it is important to caveat that the impact of the pandemic is very fluid and likely to continue evolving over the coming weeks and months. As such, our perspective relies upon numerous internal and external sources to help inform financial projections related to our near-term outlook.  What does that include? Our assumptions consider external expert assessments related to the macro impact of COVID-19 and potential negative consequences it may have on the overall health care system on the number of insured individuals and evolving consumer and patient spending in addition to the frame of mind related to health care behavior when it comes to, for instance, elective procedures and office visits. We are also relying on numerous conversations that Alex, Ashley, and our Medical Device leaders are having with hospital system administrators and surgeons related to capacity, the preparedness for potential spikes of the virus, the improvements that have been implemented to treat COVID-19 patients and the economics of their institution. Lastly, we review extensive analytics on our business that account for individual weekly hospital trends.  Taking these quantitative and qualitative factors into account, let's delve into our updated 2020 guidance, beginning with our Pharmaceutical business. Our expectations for our Pharmaceutical business remain unchanged. In Q2, we did experience reduced patient interactions with health care providers which impacted new patient starts and lower activity for physician-administered drugs, but we are seeing improvement in recent weeks for those areas. You may recall Q1 was very strong, with a modest piece of that strength attributable to pharmacy providers offering longer prescription durations, which slightly impacted Q2 results negatively. All in all, the strength of our Pharmaceutical portfolio that addresses significant patient need gives us confidence to expect above-market growth in 2020 once again.  Regarding our Consumer Health segment. Here, too, we see no changes to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. We are off to a fast start in over-the-counter medicines and Oral Care, with those franchises growing year-to-date 2 to 3x versus what we grew in 2019, reflecting some increased COVID-19 demand. As Chris shared, that growth is partially offset by results in other categories, namely skin health/beauty, primarily due to COVID-19. We are proceeding as planned with the SKU rationalization program mentioned in January to improve future operating margins.  Shifting to Medical Devices. Changes from the guidance we offered in April are driven by what we have learned since then. And similar to the first quarter, these assumptions are the most ambiguous at this time. As expected, the medical device industry continues to experience near-term negative impacts while elective procedures are deferred and hospital resources are redeployed to address COVID-19. We assume the most significant negative impact to Medical Devices would occur in the second quarter. That is still our expectation.  In April, based on data available at the time, we assumed a weighted average decline across all markets and all procedures in the second quarter of 40% to 60% versus our original expectations to start the year. As you can see on this slide, total Medical Devices performed better than that assumption as economies around the world began opening sooner than anticipated, but was still down approximately 35% in the quarter. Importantly, we are encouraged by the improvement we saw in each month in the second quarter, with the month of June being down the least at approximately 25% versus our original expectations. Not surprisingly, urgent procedures declined at a lesser rate than procedures considered deferrable.  As we think about the remainder of 2020, the ramp of the recovery is the most difficult variable to estimate. When we provided guidance in April, we expected the impact of COVID-19 in Medical Devices to linger throughout Q2 and Q3 with a recovery in Q4. However as just noted, we experienced a faster recovery than anticipated. And thus, the backlog of patients we originally predicted in Q4 as a result of pent-up demand is now presumed to occur earlier in the year.  Additionally, given China was the first country impacted and Japan and Korea were seeing early success in containing the virus, we bucketed these 3 markets together when providing guidance in April. As you can see, China has been the first market to recover and returned to double-digit growth versus prior year in Q2. However, Japan and Korea saw new cases rise early in the quarter and implemented restrictions, resulting in declines consistent with the rest of total Medical Devices. Similarly, the bucket of countries we defined as major markets saw some countries like Germany outperforming our overall Medical Devices business, whereas other markets such as the U.S. declined 40% versus our original expectations to start the year.  Clearly, the countries bucketed together in our April framework are performing differently from each other and therefore are no longer the best representation of how our business will perform going forward. Additionally, the dynamics within a country can be very different across communities. Our evolving detailed procedural model allows us to forecast at a granular level within each country. As such, we are not relying on the previous regionally based buckets and instead are providing our expectations for Q3 and Q4 for total Medical Devices to provide visibility to the impact in a simplified manner.  In Q3, we now expect a decline of 10% to 25% versus our original expectations to start the year, a smaller decline than we incorporated in our April guidance. In Q4, we are now assuming a decline of 15% to 0%, consistent with my remarks from a moment ago, with the pent-up demand we were anticipating largely occurs throughout quarters 2 and 3. Considering all these factors, we estimate a negative operational sales impact of approximately $3.8 billion to approximately $5.3 billion to the Medical Devices forecast below our original January guidance. While there are many moving parts, the impact on Medical Devices is the sole change to our prior operational sales guidance for the enterprise.  Now we often get asked about a second wave of COVID. Our thinking continues to be that, if that occurs, it should not have the same level of global impact that's been experienced in the last 4 months. This assumption is based on opinions shared by various experts as they believe, as do we, that if this occurs, the world is much better prepared. How so? Testing is more readily available. Remarkably, over 700,000 tests now occur daily in the U.S. alone. There is adequate supply of necessary medical equipment. Isolation and other preventative measures are being implemented quickly with more precision. Treatment protocols continue to improve, and there may be therapeutic options available. Finally, a portion of the population will have developed antibodies. While 1 death is too many, with a rapidly declining death rate related to the virus, the health care system is much better positioned than when the virus first appeared. Therefore, while we actively monitor the rising case rate, our premise is that procedures and doctor visits will be largely permissible in the second half of this year.  So let's summarize our Medical Device outlook. We still estimate the most significant negative impact occurred in Q2, but the impact to both Q2 and Q3 is now expected to be less than what we were anticipating in April. This upside is partially offset in Q4 compared to our April guidance as that predicted bolus of patients is now assumed to have occurred earlier in the year. We are seeing signs of recovery. And while the next few months and quarters contain uncertainty, the long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid. And most importantly, we continue to see tremendous potential over the long term to serve our patients and customers. Given all these factors, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the following. Adjusted operational sales of minus 0.8% to positive 1.0%, incorporating the latest range of negative Medical Device operational sales impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $5 billion versus January guidance. Moving on to operational sales. Our guidance is $81 billion to $82.5 billion or minus 1.3% to a positive 0.5%. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.13, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 130 basis points versus the negative 200 basis points provided in our April guidance, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between minus 2.6% to minus 0.8% compared to 2019 or $79.9 billion to $81.4 billion. We are maintaining our expectation for operating margins with a decline year-over-year of 100 basis points as well as April guidance ranges of net other income and net interest expense. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 is now estimated to be 16.5% to 17.5%, tighter than the previous range.  Given those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $7.85 to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. This reflects an operational or constant currency decline of 9.6% to 7.3%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share versus our April guidance impact of a negative $0.15. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.75 to $7.95, a range of minus 10.7% to minus 8.4%. I know many of you are interested in our thoughts beyond 2020, so I thought I would say a few words on very early thinking on select topics for next year. In our Pharmaceutical business, we don't anticipate new biosimilar or generic competitors and expect another year of above-market performance, largely driven by increased penetration and new indications across our existing diversified portfolio led by key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA. In our Consumer Health business, we will continue to focus on delivering solid growth in our core strongholds of OTC and skin health and continued expansion of the e-commerce channel. In Medical Devices, based on what we know today, we expect procedures to be largely permissible throughout the year. And given COVID-19's impact on 2020, we expect to deliver robust double-digit operational sales growth. Regarding the P&L for 2021. While not providing guidance at this very early stage, I will share that we are expecting other income and expense to be consistent with the guidance I just shared for 2020. In addition, while we continue to manage our portfolio with rigor, emphasizing platforms where we can optimize our success, we are planning to treat future significant divestiture gains as a special item going forward. We would expect to improve operating margins from this year's level given higher sales as well as realizing benefits from our SKU rationalization initiative in Consumer Health. And finally, as a reminder, when comparing revenue next year versus this year, our 2020 fiscal calendar has the benefit of additional 2 to 3 shipping days associated with a 53rd week. Robust plans are being developed and will be finalized as we move throughout 2020. We anticipate strong EPS growth in 2021 on an operational basis given some of the dynamics at play in 2020, and commit to providing updates as appropriate on future earnings calls. Let me conclude prepared remarks with our key developments in the quarter. As we look at our pipeline, we have been able to advance a majority of our portfolio despite COVID-19, but I'd like to highlight a few items. Beginning with the Pharmaceutical pipeline. In addition to the progress Paul referenced on the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we had a number of approvals in the second quarter included on this slide, several ahead of their PDUFA dates. Most notable are TREMFYA for active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., DARZALEX for subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU, IMBRUVICA frontline in CLL combo with rituximab in the U.S. and the Ebola vaccine in the EU. We updated our filing time line slightly for our BCMA CAR-T. We remain on track to initiate the U.S. regulatory application by year-end 2020 and have updated timing of the EU submission to early 2021, which accounts for comprehensive manufacturing and commercial plans.  You will also note that we are no longer filing niraparib in line 3 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The data from the Phase II GALAHAD study did demonstrate a highly competitive efficacy and safety profile for niraparib, which supported FDA breakthrough therapy designation. However, recent approvals of other agents in this class have removed the path to gain accelerated approval for niraparib based on this single-arm study. Considering this development, we will not be moving forward with regulatory submissions with GALAHAD, but niraparib remains an important part of our prostate cancer pipeline, with $1-billion-plus revenue potential. Turning to Medical Devices. We continue to advance our innovation agenda with some notable achievements in the quarter, such as: U.S. FDA breakthrough designation for Monarch-enabled NeuWave ablation technology; CE Mark for Heliostar, our single-shot balloon catheter; and CE Mark for QDOT, a microcatheter enabling better lesion treatment, just to highlight a few. We also continued to advance digital surgery offerings. Since launch, there have been over 3,200 lung biopsies completed using the Monarch system. We will also expand the system with multi-specialty applications with endourology next in line for U.S. approval with the treatment of kidney stones, a market that is almost twice the size of the one we are in today. We continue to make great progress towards a second half 2020 U.S. regulatory submission for our orthopedic robotics solution as part of our VELYS digital surgery platform, first in knees, coming out of our acquisition of Orthotaxy. In General Surgery, we will incorporate elements from the general surgery robotic platforms of both Verb and Auris, which we believe enhances our value proposition and increases our ability to create a differentiated platform for surgeons. We continue to have ongoing conversations with regulatory authorities around the world. And based on these conversations, we will not be following a 510(k) regulatory pathway in the U.S. After analyzing time to market compared to overall value proposition, our goal is to initiate first-in-human studies with our robotic solution in the second half of 2022. We continue to be very excited about the overall program and that our continued investment here will offer a differentiated and competitive product to the market with better outcomes for patients. The new time lines are based on what we know today, reflecting a world that is very different than what it was just a few short months ago. One item occurring after the second quarter close and not listed on this slide was Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation's sale of the equity position in Idorsia. As part of the Actelion acquisition in 2017, you may recall that we employed an innovative deal structure resulting in the formation of a new company, which is now established. We remain very excited about our ongoing partnership with Idorsia on assets like Ponesimod and Aprocitentan.  Before I hand the call back to Chris, I want to express our sincere gratitude to our 132,000 associates around the world. Johnson & Johnson's strong foundations begin with their tireless effort and unwavering dedication to elevating the standards of health care. In a tumultuous year, they remain focused on credo values and meeting commitments to patients, doctors and nurses, employees, parents and children, communities and shareholders. Without them, our current and future success would not be possible. Chris, back to you to begin the Q&A portion. Chris, this is Joe. Maybe just to pick up with respect to your questions around Vision Care specifically. So contact lenses was down a little bit over 30% in the quarter. Clearly the impact of COVID-19 as there's just simply less new wearers entering the category due to a shutdown of optical stores, but also lower consumption for existing wearers as people adopt shelter-in-place measures and stay at home. The e-commerce channel, which primarily serves existing wearers, was also down when you compare it to the second quarter of last year. But we are seeing an improved performance. So if you look at June, contact lenses was down almost 25% versus the prior year. So you're seeing that same quarterly improvement throughout -- the monthly improvement throughout the quarter with respect to contact lenses. In terms of Vision Surgical, I would say that's probably one of the most deferrable procedures out there. And so as we start to see elective procedures become more prevalent, we would expect that to return as well. David, your second point? So Matt, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. You're thinking about it appropriately. So we took down the fourth quarter simply because that pent-up demand or that backlog that we thought would occur from a deferment of procedures in Q2 and Q3 when we issued guidance in April is, quite frankly, not occurring. That's a good thing for certainly patients, but for the health care system, that there's not some unintended consequences with the deferral of very, very important procedures.  The model going forward is based on the best information we had coming out of June. So yes, it would reflect that. And I think that's probably a fair assumption or premise to say that if we had a slowdown here as cases rise in select areas, that, that slowdown would probably be compensated with an improvement to the outlook for Q4, possibly Q1, depending on how long elective procedures are not permitted.  Again, I do want to emphasize that collectively as a society, as a health care system at large, we're much better prepared. And when there are isolation measures that are put in place, it's much more selective than maybe the universal approach we were looking at back at the end of March or early April. So I think it would be less of an impact, but I don't think it's unfair to think that, that impact, if negative, would come back in a positive way at some point later in the future. Yes. So Bob, I would say that it probably looks at trends the way they were occurring more at the end of June. That's the best data -- official data that we had. So we rely on certainly the IHME model, but also studies that are being done and analytics from UCLA, MIT and various other sources.  As Alex mentioned, the outreach that he's had personally, that Ashley has had personally, and other medical device leaders in our company, to the customers themselves to understand what's going on in the ground is probably the most insightful qualitative analysis we put into our modeling, and that's been extremely helpful. So I would say it's largely based on the trends that we saw at the end of June.  And again, I do want to caution folks that while we are seeing a rise in cases, it is in very select communities, in very select states. So again, it's not that same universal approach. And to the size of the business in Medical Devices, it would have a relatively minor impact, in our thinking, should one of those areas slow down versus what the dynamic was at the end of March and early April. Joaquin, maybe you want to answer the new to brand? Thanks, Joaquin. And Louise, with respect to your question about how much has already been captured with the second quarter results. I think if you just look purely at the numbers, a lot of the guidance uptake was dependent upon, at least for top line, on the results of the second quarter, specifically in Medical Devices. From our April guidance, we kind of knocked out the worst-case scenario, if you will. And we also saw a little bit of improvement with currency translation as well. With respect to earnings in the bottom line. As you know, I think coming into the call, at least as of Monday's data, it suggests that we beat by roughly $0.20 per share on the bottom line. We've taken our guidance up operationally $0.10 as we're going to continue to look and challenge our teams for good, solid investments for the balance of this year that fortify 2021 and beyond. And that's kind of how we're thinking of this going forward. So Terence, I'll answer in terms of operating margin first before turning it over to Joaquin for some of the payer mix. In terms of margins, you -- this right -- that' you're absolutely right. This is a year that's a little bit abnormal, to say the least. So we would expect margin improvement off of this year.  I would point to a number of initiatives that we had already in place that should continue to yield better margins, specifically in our consumer unit, where we did have a SKU rationalization program which should be fully executed by the end of this year. That will help improve margins. And then some broader supply chain initiatives that we had with respect to our partnership with Jabil largely in our Medical Device unit.  So, we would anticipate that there would be margin improvement. We're still going to look to prioritize investment in R&D. I think it was a very strong sign for the company that our level of R&D investment in the second quarter of this year was actually slightly higher than what it was last year. Despite the work-from-home dynamic, we continued to progress our pipeline across all three of our businesses."

            "name": "Paulus Stoffels",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our vaccine program, particularly our progress on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.  As you know, we announced our lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate on March 30. And since then, we have made significant progress. We have seen strong preclinical data so far, which were published in the Journal of Science in May. These data validated the preclinical vaccine challenge model and showed that prototype DNA vaccines were able to create strong immunity. Based on these data and interactions with regulatory authorities, we were able to accelerate the clinical development program of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Since then, we have initiated a study of a final Ad26 vaccine candidate in nonhuman primate challenge model. These results will be published in a major scientific journal in the coming weeks.  Based on this total package of results, we are very comfortable moving forward with Phase I/IIa studies later this month. This represents an acceleration of our time line from our original date of September to the end of July. These studies will establish both the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate as well as evaluate the single dose and the booster dose regimen. The trials will be conducted in more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years as well as adult aged 65 years and older. Our study sites are located in the U.S. and Belgium.  We are also planning for a Phase II study in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany and plan to conduct a Phase I study in Japan. We anticipate the initiation of the trial on July 22 in Belgium and the following week in the U.S. We are also in discussions with the National Institute of Health with the objective to start a Phase III clinical trial ahead of its original schedule, potentially in late September, to evaluate the effectiveness of our vaccine. We are using epidemiology data to predict and plan where our study should take place. We also announced that, in parallel with the clinical development, we are working to expand our global manufacturing capacity to be able to deliver more than 1 billion doses of our COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021. We have made excellent progress on this front as well.  In addition to building out our internal manufacturing capabilities, we entered into collaborations with Emergent BioSolutions and Catalent Biologics and others to support commercial manufacturing of the vaccine. As you have heard me say previously, our COVID-19 vaccine program is leveraging Janssen's adenovector technology that provides the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates. The same technology was used to construct our HIV, RSV and Zika vaccine candidates.  And to develop our Ebola vaccine regimen, we just received marketing authorization from the European Commission for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. The EMA approval is the culmination of work that begun in response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014. Achieving major regulatory approval in this time frame is a tremendous accomplishment. The approval marks the first major regulatory approval of a vaccine developed by Janssen, confirming the potential of our adenovector technology. To date, more than 80,000 people have been vaccinated using this vaccine technology.  As we have previously shared, we are also working on an HIV vaccine and are pleased to report that we have reached an important milestone. Earlier this month, our Imbokodo trial, taking place across Sub-Saharan Africa, reached an important milestone with all people having completed all study vaccination despite difficult COVID-19 circumstances. And we expect the outcomes of this study in the next 2 years. Together with our partners at the NIH and The Gates Foundation, we now have the most advanced HIV candidate in clinical development. These recent milestones strengthen our confidence in our vaccine technology.  The work we are doing today to help address the COVID-19 pandemic built on more than 130 years of Johnson & Johnson's leadership in public health. We believe we have a responsibility to step in and invest in solutions for global public health crisis and are proud to be contributing to the global response to COVID-19. Our efforts to expedite the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and to identify potential treatments are enhanced by multiple collaborations with government, academia, health authorities and others worldwide. And we are working with them to ensure the broadest possible access to people around the world. Thank you.  Joe, I will now turn it over to you. Well first, from experience, to start the clinical trial, we have developed a vaccine platform over the last 6, 7 years. And we have now more than 80,000 people who have been vaccinated by our platform. And that is in RSV, in Zika, in HIV and Ebola. And that gives very good comfort that we have a safe platform. In addition to that, we have been able, in RSV and Zika, to use a high dose, at 110-11, for those who know what it means, is that is the highest dose you can administer, but with almost no fever. So we will be able to administer a very high single dose, which will be enabled in our Zika and in our RSV, will elicit a very strong neutralizing antibody response as well as a cellular immunity response with one single dose. Whether we need to boost for durability, we have learned that in Ebola, we have learned that in others, that maybe yes, but not immediately. We are going to test a boost dose as we start, but we think more that we will have to boost 1 year or 2 years after the single high dose.  So we're going to learn fast. And with a single-dose Phase I study, we should be able to start mid-September with the experience we have, and that's in full discussion with the regulatory authorities around the world. On your vaccine question, Larry, first, I want to also add to it that neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immunity is important here for -- not just for the response, but also for durability. Our initial data on the Phase I will be available second half of September, which they will be -- become the basis for a Phase III study. And that will start mid to end September, that's the goal. With a large number of people included and a simple design with a single dose, we could have data before the year-end, or at the latest, early next year. And availability of a vaccine will be starting early next year. We'll have some dosages before the year-end which will be used for clinical trials and maybe for other reasons, but the larger quantity will start first quarter of next year. And then in the year, we will deliver up to 1 billion dosage of our vaccine. And all of that is in place. We have the manufacturing sites. We have the filling sites. We have everything what's needed to deliver that 1 billion vaccines and more next year. Well, in nonhuman primates and in animal models, you can get to a high level of protection. So we -- it's difficult to extrapolate to humans. But typically, we have a good correlation between animal models in all of our experiments with RSV, HIV, Ebola and Zika. So we should expect significantly above 50%. Well, the barrier is for the FDA, I think you should expect 70%, 80%, in that range at least, and that is also the statistics which will go into the studies. So let's hope we reach that because that could create herd immunity and we could hopefully get a stop -- put a stop to the disease. So let's hope for a very good neutralizing antibody level protecting people at a very high level."

Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today\u2019s agenda, Alex will start with his perspectives related to the COVID-19 pandemic and JNJ\u2019s response. Paul will then update you on our efforts to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus along with JNJ\u2019s therapeutic development efforts. Next, I will cover consolidated and segment sales information along with some operational highlights from the P&L with the estimated COVID-19 impact framed where applicable. Joe will conclude by providing insights on the status of our operations, including actions we are taking to maintain business continuity, how we think about our capital allocation during this time and will provide an update on our full year guidance. The remaining time will be available for your questions. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky.\nAlex Gorsky: Thank you, Chris and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I also want to thank Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels for joining our first quarter webcast. As the Vice Chairs of Johnson & Johnson and given the leadership role they are playing as we mobilize our efforts and resources across the company to address COVID-19, I thought it would be helpful to have both of them available to answer potential questions and convey key information. Paul will also share more detailed perspective in his prepared commentary which will follow my remarks. Clearly, COVID-19 is at the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind, which is why we plan to spend a fair amount of time during the earnings webcast discussing this unprecedented global pandemic, the profound impact it is having on global public health, and our unwavering commitment to create and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Johnson & Johnson was built for times like this and our strong first quarter results are just one reflection of our sustainable business model. Our Johnson & Johnson colleagues remain focused on delivering on the commitments and responsibilities to our patients, doctors, nurses, employees, parents, children, communities and shareholders as defined in our Credo. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $1.01 which is another reflection of our stability and further underscores our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. This marks the 58th consecutive year of dividend increases for Johnson & Johnson and we believe that taking this action is the right thing to do for our shareholders at this time and importantly a strong example of the confidence we have in our business now and in the future. Given Chris and Joe will discuss our first quarter performance and outlook in greater detail, I would like to take just a few minutes to highlight four pillars of strength that reinforce why Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. These pillars serve as the foundation of our resiliency and response to the current COVID-19 crisis and provide the dynamic foundation for Johnson & Johnson to continue to build a stronger, healthier and successful future for all of our stakeholders. And we recognize the challenges that individuals, companies and the world are facing right now. As we look forward, we are confident that together we will win this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and we are maintaining a long-term view of optimism. The first pillar is our longstanding belief in driving both performance and purpose with equal commitment. Across Johnson & Johnson, we operate with the belief there is a tightly linked connection between our company\u2019s purpose, which is to advance health for humanity and our financial performance which has helped us deliver lifesaving medicines and lifesaving products as well as invest and support communities around the world. We recognize the challenges that families and their loved ones are facing in these volatile and unpredictable times and this is exactly why across our enterprise we have been working so hard our help those in need and to accelerate our collective efforts towards ending this pandemic. Some examples of note include, we are applying all of our capabilities to support nurses, doctors, midwives and community health workers. Recently, it was announced that Johnson & Johnson family of companies and the Johnson & Johnson Foundation are increasing our previous $250 million commitment over 10 years by an additional $50 million for immediate COVID-19 response. This contribution will primarily focus on supporting frontline health workers who are truly modern day heroes and the backbone of the healthcare system. We are also working diligently to convert manufacturing lines of several facilities around the world for products most in need during the pandemic so we can continue to provide important medicines and products to patients. The second pillar I want to highlight is of strategic advantage of being the most broadly based healthcare company in the industry. Leading across the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices segments provides us with the unique and powerful perspective that enables us to see more, reach more, learn more and do more across the full spectrum of health as well as throughout every age and stage of our patients and consumers\u2019 lives. In fact, in our pharmaceutical business, we are thrilled to have identified a lead candidate for a potential vaccine. In consumer, Tylenol is one of our most iconic and trusted brands by consumers and healthcare professional for reducing fever and we have increased production running our Tylenol manufacturing plant 24/7 to maximize supply. We have also refocused our manufacturing lines to make our easiest-to-produce pills, which are the white Tylenol caplets, so we can increase production and throughput. In Medical Devices, we are experiencing a near term negative impact and expect this to continue while elective procedures are deferred and hospital resources are redeployed to address patients impacted by this pandemic. That said, Medical Devices has historically been a strong market and we believe the underlying fundamentals of the market remain intact. We continue to see tremendous potential over the long-term to serve our patients and customers. And at this time, and in this time of need, we are utilizing our supply chain delivery in 3D printing expertise in collaboration with Prisma Health to manufacture and distribute the VESper ventilator expansion splitter device, which addresses the acute ventilator shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic and at no cost to healthcare providers. Additionally, we continue to support and share product availability to healthcare workers, hospital systems and surgeons in critical need areas such as trauma, stroke and other life saving surgeries that cannot be deferred. The third pillar is our unparalleled scientific expertise. Innovation is integral to our ability to deliver breakthrough healthcare solutions and the remarkable and ambitious work that we have underway to eradicate COVID-19 is a true testament to this fact. Based on 134 years of experience, we know that the power of our science, the scale of our business and the dedication of our employees is critical in driving innovative solutions that can change people\u2019s lives for the better and change the face of healthcare. In collaboration with scientists from various external institutions, we have been able to identify a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate. We will leverage the scientific expertise of our internal teams with a decade of work spend developing vaccines for HIV, Zika and Ebola to apply the groundbreaking science and scalable manufacturing platform that we already have in place. This is monumental and is much needed. We are accelerating timelines and plan to begin production at risk imminently. And we are committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The fourth and last pillar is the world-class talent, capabilities and dedication of our 132,000 colleagues worldwide. We always take actions and employee tactics to support our Johnson & Johnson colleagues, both professionally and personally, to ensure they are safe and well equipped and today is no different. We are ensuring employees are able to play their part in helping to fight the COVID-19 outbreak at home and at work. Some examples include we\u2019ve implemented significantly enhanced sanitizing procedures and appropriate distancing to ensure we maintain safe, clean and well functioning facilities across our manufacturing, distribution centers and research and development sites. We are rolling out a one-time award of $1000 per essential employee with cost of living adjustments globally whose presence is required on site to recognize the extraordinary work these employees are doing to advance our science and ensure supply of our most essential products and medicines. We are providing 100% of base salary and benefits through April 30 to employees who are primary caregivers and are unable to work remotely due to COVID-related family care responsibilities, underlying health issues, connectivity issues or other unique circumstances. And we are granting up to 14 weeks of paid leave to employees around the world with medical training who volunteer or who are called to serve the communities in diagnosing, treating and providing health support related to COVID-19. And underpinning each of these four pillars is our Credo. Our Credo has been a source of both inspiration and confidence for me and my Johnson & Johnson colleagues, especially in times like these. For more than 75 years, our Credo has been the moral compass that guides our business decisions and it\u2019s the blueprint that outlines how we operate and care for the world. Guided by our Credo and unyielding sense of purpose, we have created a powerful legacy of improving the health and well-being of people worldwide, while delivering sustainable long-term value to all of our stakeholders. We have a century plus history of leading in times of great challenge. We have done it before and we can do it again. This is what the world expects of us and this is what we are all committed to, and prepared to do. Now as the world continues to face the significant and urgent public health crisis, I want to emphasize that across Johnson & Johnson, we are leveraging our broad base, size and scale to think, lead and operate with the same level of incredible urgency relying on the same courage, conviction and core strengths that set us apart and empower us to make a positive impact on society and healthcare. I am both proud and amazed at the level of dedication that I\u2019ve witnessed from every Johnson & Johnson business, function, team and person over the last several weeks. Now, we certainly don\u2019t have all the answers today. We\u2019ll find the ones needed to ensure our success for tomorrow and we won\u2019t take shortcuts to compromise our standards or values as we move with speed and determination. As I said earlier, Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. We take a long-term strategic view, which means we\u2019re in this for the long haul delivering value to all of our stakeholders. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I\u2019ll now turn it over to Paul, who will provide an update on the progress we\u2019re making with the COVID-19 vaccine development. Thank you. Paul?\nPaul Stoffels: Thank you, Alex. I\u2019m pleased to provide an update on a multi-pronged approach to addressing COVID-19 including developing a vaccine and screening of compound libraries to identify potential new treatments to address this pandemic. In addition, we are exploring immunomodulators to protect against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS in COVID-19. While we focus today on finding potential new treatments, ultimately a vaccine is key to eradicating the ongoing threat of the pandemic. Since 2011, Johnson & Johnson has invested heavily to build state-of-the-art vaccine capabilities which we used to develop and manufacture our Ebola, Zika, RSV and HIV vaccine candidates. We are bringing to bear those same capabilities to rapidly accelerate our efforts towards the potential COVID-19 vaccine. We are pleased to see that there are many approaches to vaccines for COVID-19 which show the importance of ongoing research in industry over the past several decades. Our COVID-19 vaccine program leverages Janssen Adeno vector and PER. C6 technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. Based on the WHO criteria for key attributes for prioritizing vaccine platforms, here on the right, the attributes of our platform put us in a leadership position. First, our Adeno26 viral vector platform induces potent and long lasting humoral and cellular immune responses in humans. Further this approach has very low to no risk on the respiratory disease enhancement based on the immune responses observed across our programs. This is in line with the observation that targeted preclinical models used in context of the RSV vaccine development have shown that this platform is not associated with enhanced respiratory disease. Our platform has a proven safety profile. More than 50,000 people have been vaccinated and we have demonstrated that it\u2019s well tolerated. Our PER.C6 cell line offers a high yielding vaccine manufacturing platform and is scalable and fully industrialized providing us the ability to make hundreds of millions of vaccines per year. Capacity in our Leiden-based vaccines launch facility is as high as 300 million doses per year. Finally, we have 2 to 8 Celsius stability data on our vaccine making it compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels and therefore will not require new infrastructure to get it to the people who need it. We began working on a vaccine candidate in early January as soon as the coronavirus sequence became first available. As you can see in the infographic on the right, to make vaccine candidates, we insert a piece of the spike protein into the genome of a non-replicating and therefore non-infective adenovirus, a type of common cold virus. The research teams at Janssen in collaboration with BIDMC at Harvard Medical School constructed and tested multiple vaccine candidates. The vaccine constructs were tested then to identify those with most promise in producing an immune response in pre-clinical testing. Based on this work, Johnson & Johnson announced for March 30 that we have identified the lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate along with two backups. In order for any vaccine to be manufacture to GMP in large quantities, it is necessary to first produce a Master Seed bank which is den for genitive of all future large scale vaccination batches. All three candidates are now entering pre-Master Seed production. Final selection of start of Master Seed production is expected in June 2020. As we have already announced, we are expanding our global manufacturing capacity in parallel, including the establishment of a new U.S. vaccine manufacturing capability. We are also in discussions with other potential partners to expand manufacturing capacity in Europe and Asia and look forward to making those announcements in the coming weeks. We plan to begin production at risk imminently and our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally. We are on track to start Phase 1 clinical trials in early September in the U.S. and Europe with clinical data on safety and immunogenicity expected to be available by the end of the year. This could allow vaccine availability for emergency use authorization as early as early 2021. We are confident in this vaccine candidate because we have now seen good data in animal models. While we are moving with extreme speeds, we are absolutely committed to making sure that our vaccine follows all guidelines with regard to good manufacturing practices and quality controls. We are not cutting any corners when it comes to safety. We are able to achieve the speed because we are doing several processes in parallel many at risk rather than in sequence. In addition to our work on vaccines we are screening compound libraries, including compounds from Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies to identify potential treatments against COVID-19 and exploring immunomodulators to protect against ARDS. The antiviral screening efforts are being conducted in partnership with the Rega Institute at the University of Leuven in Belgium. As I mentioned, we have been able to reach this point as a result of multiple collaborations. As you also saw in the March 30 announcement as part of our new partnership with BARDA, we have together committed more than $1 billion of investment to co-fund vaccine research, development, clinical testing and accelerated manufacturing. If a vaccine is approved, we will work with relevant healthcare authorities to ensure that our products are accessible wherever needed. We are committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. In conclusion, I want to note that COVID-19 is one of the most severe global health challenges we have seen in our lifetimes, but at the same time, we have unprecedented science and technology available today to help us mount a false and effective response. Johnson & Johnson is committed to harnessing the latest tools sharing knowledge and resources and fueling global collaborations to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. Now, I will turn it over to Chris to discuss our results for the quarter. Thank you.\nChris DelOrefice: Thank you, Paul. Now, I will provide our Q1 results. Worldwide sales were $20.7 billion for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 3.3% versus the first quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 4.8% as currency had a negative impact of 1.5 points. In the U.S., sales increased 5.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1%. However, operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4%, with currency negatively impacting our reported o-U.S. results by 3 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.6% worldwide, 6.7% in the U.S., and 4.5% outside the U.S. These global sales results include an estimated net impact of COVID-19 which negatively impacted worldwide sales by about 80 basis points. This includes a negative impact to our medical device business segment across all regions with Asia-Pacific and the U.S. regions seeing the most prominent impact. Partially offsetting this was a net positive sales lift in our consumer health and pharmaceutical business segments as communities prepare to ensure they have the necessary access to healthcare products and medicines. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter net earnings were $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share, was $2.17 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.39 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.30, representing increases of 8.7% and 9.5% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.5%. Beginning with consumer health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the first quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Additionally, I will be providing additional insights using our best estimates on the contribution of COVID-19 to our performance in the areas where this had the largest impact. Worldwide consumer health sales totaled $3.6 billion growing 11.3% with operational growth in the U.S. of 21% and growth outside the U.S. of 3.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 11%. Our consumer health segment realized a net positive impact of nearly 700 basis points associated with consumers ensuring they have access to products during the COVID-19 pandemic. We do expect some of this benefit to reverse over the subsequent quarters this year. This benefit was mostly realized in our over-the-counter medicines franchise. The benefit was also most prominent in the U.S. with a small benefit outside the U.S. primarily in Europe offset by declines in Asia-Pacific in mostly the skin health beauty and baby franchises. Excluding some one-time items and the net benefit of COVID-19, our consumer health segment delivered solid performance with continued strong performance in the U.S. in priority areas within our OTC and skin health beauty franchises. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally almost 26% operationally with about 36% growth in the U.S. and 17% outside the U.S. COVID-19 contributed about 17 points to the global growth. In the U.S., we estimated COVID-19 contributed about 24 points to growth and excluding that impact, our growth was strong enabled by share increases multiple products such as Adult Tylenol, PEPCID, ZYRTEC and Zarbee\u2019s. U.S. performance was also aided by a stronger allergy season. Additionally, there were some favorable one-time benefits resulting from competitive dynamics. COVID-19 contributed about 10 points to growth outside the U.S. Excluding that, growth was strong driven by an elevated cough and cold season in key markets like Russia. The skin health beauty franchise grew 3.5% or just under 2% when adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures driven primarily by the acquisition of Dr. Ci:Labo. This franchise experienced a net negative impact due to COVID-19 by slightly over 100 basis points with the largest negative impact in Asia-Pacific, especially in China partially offset by a favorable benefit in the U.S., the U.S. operational growth of just over 12%, benefited by about 450 basis points from COVID-19. Additionally, our core business in the U.S. remains competitive with strong performance in NEUTROGENA Facial Care. The U.S. also benefited from some timing of promotional orders. And in our remaining consumer health franchises, our oral care, women\u2019s health and wound care other franchises all reported strong growth primarily driven by COVID-19 and excluding the favorable impact of COVID-19. Each of these franchises delivered solid performance. Baby Care declined 4.9% globally or negative 2.7% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. The majority of this decline was primarily due to the execution of SKU rationalization actions primarily in EMEA and a smaller net negative COVID-19 impact partially offset by solid growth in Aveeno Baby globally. Moving on to the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $11.1 billion grew 10.1% enabled by double-digit growth in 9 key products. Sales grew in the U.S. by 8.6% and increased outside the U.S. by 12%. Global growth was aided by over 200 basis points of one-time items including about 100 basis points of impact from favorable prior period pricing adjustments in the U.S. with REMICADE being the largest product impacted and about 100 basis points of net favorable estimated impact from COVID-19 resulting from healthcare providers and wholesalers ensuring there is access to essential medicines. This benefit occurred across our portfolio with favorable benefits in the U.S. and Europe offsetting downside in the Asia-Pacific region in mostly China. Incremental COVID-19 demand primarily impacted IMBRUVICA, XARELTO, STELARA, the pulmonary hypertension portfolio and HIV products. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to continue to deliver global growth at above market levels. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of almost 22%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing over 51% globally. The U.S. grew almost 32%, with strong growth across all lines of therapy, driven by the new frontline medications for multiple myeloma. The continued strong growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains. IMBRUVICA grew over 34% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth, primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U.S., along with strong uptake outside the U.S. In the U.S., based on fourth quarter data, IMBRUVICA gained almost 8 points of market share in CLL line 1 therapy. We continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA. As part of the sales reporting changes I mentioned earlier, we are now disclosing ERLEADA sales separately which were $143 million globally and more than doubled versus last year driven by continued share growth in the U.S. and continued launch progress in EMEA with availability in 18 countries. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered double-digit global sales growth of 13.1% driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U.S. STELARA growth of over 30% was primarily driven by the Crohn\u2019s disease indication, where market share increased by over 7 points in the U.S. versus the first quarter of 2019. TREMFYA grew over 37% and achieved a 9% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 2.5 points from the first quarter of 2019. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing almost 13%, with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO where the unmet need remains high. Patient demand continues to build with new patient starts steadily increasing with over 5,000 patients treated to-date. In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 11%, led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and Juluca for HIV, partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products. In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 13.1% primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO also declined by 2.7% with volume increases offset by increased rebates including channel mix dynamics. In our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio, sales increased 14.7% driven by strong growth of OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI of about 29% and 27% respectively driven by increased market penetration and share growth. This portfolio growth was net of declining sales in TRACLEER as a result of continued generic competition. Note, as part of the sales reporting changes I referenced, TRACLEER is now included under other pulmonary hypertension. I will now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $5.9 billion declining by 6.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales declined by 4.8% worldwide. Our global medical device portfolio realized a significant impact on sales estimated to be worth 750 to 800 basis points as a result of procedures being deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic which were partially offset by stocking primarily in Asia-Pacific in anticipation of procedures ramping back up. Approximately, 50% of the net impact occurred in Asia-Pacific, about 30% was in the U.S. and the remaining balance was primarily in Europe. I will provide further context shortly about how this impacted each platform. Additionally, one-time items negatively impacted growth this quarter by about 90 basis points primarily related to there being fewer selling days in this period. Adjusting for these one-time impacts and the estimated impact of COVID-19, our adjusted operational sales growth reflects continued strong underlying fundamentals consistent with our full year 2019 adjusted results. Interventional solutions grew 0.4% globally with U.S. growth of 6.6%, offset by declining sales outside the U.S. of 5.1%. COVID-19 had a net negative impact to our global growth rate by about an estimated 14.5 points reducing U.S. growth by over 8 points and o-U.S. growth by about 20 points. Growth, excluding the impact of COVID-19, was led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. Vision declined by 4.5%. The estimated net impact of COVID-19 to growth is around 550 basis points. Additionally, results in the quarter were negatively impacted by both the final bleed-down of the Japan consumption tax forward-buy that occurred in Q3 2019, along with an unfavorable prior year comparison due to an inventory forward-buy related to Brexit uncertainty, which were worth over 200 basis points in total. While contact lenses realized a slight decline, when you adjust for the aforementioned items, the business delivered another quarter of competitive growth globally versus the market led by continued strong performance of daily disposables in the ACUVUE OASYS family. In surgical vision, sales declined 15.9% with the primary driver of the decline driven by COVID-19 which impacted results by an estimated 12 points. The business excluding COVID-19 saw continued strong o-U.S. growth in the cataract business due to strong performance in Asia-Pacific, which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S., primarily due to competitive pressures. Orthopedics declined by 6.5% in the quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted growth in this franchise by about an estimated 750 basis points with the U.S. market realizing the largest dollar impact at just over 40% of the total and the balance of the negative impact split relatively evenly between Asia-Pacific and Europe. Total orthopedics growth, adjusting for this impact, was relatively consistent with our prior quarter performance, reflecting the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance. Hips declined by 5.6%. We estimated COVID-19 negatively impacted growth by about 9.5 points. Excluding this impact, hips continue to deliver competitive performance driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach, continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS and enabling technologies such as the KINCISE surgical automated system and the VELYS Hip Navigation System that came from the Joint Point acquisition. These declined by 6.1% adjusting for the estimated COVID-19 impact of about 11 points, meaning its underlying fundamentals continue to improve and delivered solid performance in both the U.S. and o-U.S. driven by new innovations such as ATTUNE Revision, ATTUNE S+ and the ATTUNE Cementless rotating platform which launched later in 2019. Trauma declined by 3.5%. COVID-19 negatively impacted results by an estimated 400 basis points. Additionally, performance was impacted by overall market softness as a result of a mild winter season, leading to lower procedures, as well as competitive pressures. Spine declined 10.6%. However, adjusting for COVID-19\u2019s estimated impact of over 750 basis points, spine\u2019s underlying performance remain consistent with recent results. While we lost share in the quarter, we continue to see positive uptake of newer products such as Conduit and VIPER PRIME. We are also pleased with the rollout of our newly launched SYMPHONY surgical system for use in posterior cervical spine procedures. Pricing pressure continued in orthopedics. U.S. pure price in spine, hips and knees eroded versus Q4 2019 declining about 5%, 2% and 1% respectively. Price in trauma improved compared to Q4 and was essentially flat. Moving to the results for the surgery business. As I noted earlier, we made some minor adjustments to how we report our Medical Devices sales and you will see that we moved the platforms previously under specialty surgery to general surgery, now that we have closed the divestiture of the ASP business, which was the majority of the specialty surgery sales. Advanced surgery declined by 1.4%, but was significantly impacted by COVID-19 which we estimate was almost an 800 basis points impact. COVID-19 primarily impacted o-U.S. results, particularly in endocutters and energy, with an estimated negative impact to global growth of about 900 basis points to each platform. Excluding this negative impact, performance was strong led by energy. Both energy and endocutters performed well outside the U.S. driven by share gains and new products primarily in Asia and were partially offset by competitive pressure in the U.S. Biosurgery had an estimated negative impact of over 550 basis points, driven by COVID-19. However, underlying fundamentals, excluding this negative impact, remains strong with growth balance between the U.S. and o-U.S. U.S. performance in biosurgery was driven by continued uptake of SURGIFLO after last year\u2019s stop shipment, coupled with new products such as VISTASEAL. o-U.S. performance continues to be led by market and share performance in the Asia-Pacific region. We also continue to see great uptake of our Monarch system for the diagnosis of lung cancer. Q1 procedures grew 150% compared to the prior year, and almost 2700 procedures have been performed since launch. Wound closure declined over 7% in the quarter with COVID-19 negatively impacting results by an estimated 800 basis points. Growth, excluding COVID-19 was driven by continued strong market growth as well as share gains in conventional and barbed sutures in China. I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings, for the first quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the boxed section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings, adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.30 reflects reported growth of 9.5% and operational growth of 10.5%. I would like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold de-leveraged primarily as a result of product mix and the establishment of inventory reserves associated with the COVID-19 impact in the Medical Devices business. Selling marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved, driven by leveraging in the pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses and favorable segment mix partially offset by de-leveraging in the Medical Devices business resulting from the COVID-19 impact on sales. We continue to invest in research and development and competitive levels, investing 12.5% of sales this quarter. This was lower than the first quarter 2019 by 180 basis points, driven by timing of pharmaceutical milestone payments partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions in the Medical Devices business. The other income and expense line show net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to net income of $22 million last year. This was primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition partially offset by higher unrealized losses on securities. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate declined from 15.2% in the first quarter of 2019 to 11% in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of additional favorable impacts from Swiss tax reform and the reversal of the Auris contingent liability. We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15% versus 17.6% in the same period last year, driven by certain tax costs incurred in the first quarter of 2019 that were not repeated in 2020. Let\u2019s now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2020, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 70 basis points versus the first quarter of 2019 to 35%. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Pharmaceutical margins improved by 360 basis points to 45.3% primarily driven by timing of R&D milestone payments. Medical Devices declined by 540 basis points to 24.2% due to COVID-19 impacts on the business, including incremental inventory reserves and de-leveraging in selling and marketing in addition to continued increased investment in robotics and digital solutions. Consumer margins declined slightly by 50 basis points to 24.5% driven by a one-time gain in 2019 related to the company\u2019s previously held equity investment in Dr. Ci:Labo which was partially offset by leveraging selling marketing and administrative margins in the current quarter. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2020. For your reference, this slide summarizes notable developments occurring in the first quarter. Of note, we submitted new drug applications to the FDA and EMA for Ponesimod for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. We appreciate that you decided to join the call today unlike others on this call who spoke before me, I hope you and those close to you are safe and healthy. Let me state right upfront, the fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business are strong and our expectations of where the business is heading have not changed combating the current crisis is anything but usual. However, many aspects of Johnson & Johnson continued to operate with a business as usual focus such as advancing breakthrough innovation, fostering consumer and patient access and being financially disciplined. We are motivated by never stopping when it comes to taking care of you, our stakeholders and we can have a profound positive impact, because we are built to lead, built to last and quite frankly, built for times like this. My central focus in today\u2019s prepared remarks is twofold. First, I will share with you our ongoing business continuity plans. It is important particularly in times of challenge that you understand the steps we have put in place recently and over a number of years to ensure reliable supply of the important products we provide. Second, I will outline how we are thinking about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and what that will have on our near-term financial performance in the context of changes from the guidance we issued in January. I trust at the end of the my remarks and at the end of this call, the obvious conclusion is that Johnson & Johnson is strong in a financial position to meet its obligation to all stakeholders and poised for many years of success. The fundamentals of our business are intact. As Alex mentioned earlier, as the most broadly based global company in the healthcare industry, we have established a sustainable and resilient business model with flexibility designed into our research, manufacturing and commercial capabilities. We have robust active business continuity plans across our network, which have been instrumental in preparing us for events like COVID-19. Some steps we have taken recently include leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers to address high risk areas and ensure adequate and effective distribution, working closely with suppliers, distributors, local governments and regulatory to gain better insights to address their concerns through our commercial organizations supporting healthcare providers in the safest way possible by moving to virtual connections to serve as a resource for physicians. Where needed, we directly engage to support them in areas like trauma surgeries ensuring we follow all health protocols to keep everyone safe. Within clinical operations, our first priority is always to protect the health and well-being of participants currently enrolled in our clinical trials. Our next priority is to complete these trials in a manner to fully satisfy regulatory requirements. This pandemic does not change these priorities. As a result of these efforts, we are able to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs. Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to provide insights on a few topics that we typically don\u2019t detail, but are likely top of mind these days for most. From a liquidity standpoint, we are well positioned. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $18 billion generating approximately $3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter consistent with first quarters of the previous two years. Coupled with our AAA credit rating, we are able to access the capital markets if needed and would anticipate securing the most competitive credit spreads available. A strong balance sheet has been a hallmark of Johnson & Johnson and is most valued in times of macroeconomic distress. We are able to use this strength to benefit many constituents. Some recent examples include partnering with BARDA to jointly invest approximately $1 billion to not only develop and deliver a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, but potentially, in record time. We are complementing the efforts of communities and healthcare heroes through numerous donations and other activities which Alex highlighted. We are supporting small and diverse suppliers and customers, offering financial flexibility at a time when they need it most and we responsibly increased our dividend to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities are clear and remain unchanged. We continue to invest in our business with a bias towards innovation that delivers meaningful products and services to address unmet needs or commercial capabilities that generate greater access to healthy living for more people. It is investing in innovation, particularly in times of uncertainty that will not just bridge the next few months, but the next several years. After investing at or above competitive levels in our business, we look to allocate capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We know that many of our shareholders prioritize that aspect when investing in Johnson & Johnson. Alex announced earlier in the call that for the 58th straight year, we are increasing our dividend. While certainly notable from a historical standpoint, this announcement is important in that it underscores our confidence and optimism for the future. We intend to continue generating strong cash flows and be financially well positioned. Our next priority is to invest our capital in value creating M&A, pursuing transactions that bolster our portfolio or enhance our pipeline while targeting returns that compensate shareholders for the risk we are bearing on their behalf. The current crisis does not reduce our desire to do these transactions. In fact, given our financial strength, we may be in a better position to fund opportunities that will augment sustainable long-term growth. While a second quarter event, a good example of this in practice, is our recently signed preclinical research collaboration with Fate Therapeutics to develop and commercialize off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapies for up to four tumor-associated antigens, which we believe has the potential to significantly change the current cell therapy paradigm in the treatment of several distinct cancer types. Finally, within our capital allocation paradigm, as you saw the past few years, we also simultaneously allocate capital to share repurchase programs. We do not have an active program at this time and have no plans to announce a new program as we feel other capital allocation priorities take precedence at this time. Given it is often a question, let me offer a few remarks related to ongoing litigation. With respect to opioids, as announced last October, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigations. The state attorneys generals are engaged and there continues to be cooperation working towards broad participation by the states, cities and counties involved in this litigation. Regarding Talc, as we have previously stated, multiple sources of independent science and third-party testing supports the safety of our products. We await the Daubert hearing outcomes from Judge Wolfson in the Federal District Court of New Jersey. Okay. Let\u2019s move to our guidance for 2020. We know some companies in our peer set have pulled their guidance. We also know that some sell side models have not been updated. We understand that may have been an option for us as well, but in uncertain times, we look forward to offering you as much transparency and credible insight into our view of our business. We have decided to provide updated guidance, given what we know today, with the objective of finding that right balance between bolstering your confidence in Johnson & Johnson, while not providing false assurances. Things will change in the coming days, weeks and months, but at least, still have the benefit of our perspective to consider among the numerous sources you rely upon to make financial sense of the near term outlook. During the next few minutes, I will touch upon each part of our business with greater emphasis on Medical Devices. That segment is currently projected to experience the most significant impact. Let me start, however, by sharing a few assumptions that apply across our entire business. Our guidance attempts to account for the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and the potential impact it will have on the overall healthcare system capturing the potential negative impact on the number of insured individuals and how people may prioritize disposable income in the near term. Second, utilizing the experience in earlier affected markets as a reference, our estimates of the COVID-19 impact assume the relative shape of the COVID-19 curve as being more of an acute shorter-term impact rather than a prolonged impact. For our largest market, the U.S., this assumption is consistent with the estimated mid-April peak assumed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation or IHME. The IHME also predicts mid-to-late April peaks for several European countries. Third, taking into account recent statements by Dr. Fauci and other scientifically accomplished sources, our estimates do not assume the virus returns in the fall with the same intensity currently experienced. What do I mean by that? As the experts have noted in various forums, if the virus does return, the world should be much better prepared to test, identify and isolate it. There may also be therapeutic options available. So, our premise is that elective procedures and doctor visits will largely be permissible in the second half of this year. Finally, we assume a recovery for procedures that begins in the third quarter and improves further in the fourth quarter. We do anticipate some disruption to the economy and have considered it on a smaller scale. Coming out of the second quarter, we assume an improving global economy with lower unemployment, better insurance coverage and higher procedure capacity than what has been or will be experienced at peak. Let\u2019s delve into the segments. The story for Pharmaceuticals is fairly straightforward. Our results in the first quarter confirm the strength of our Pharmaceutical business and we expect it to be resilient. We provide valuable solutions in critical disease states with high unmet need and we largely expect patients will continue to receive and seek treatment. Quite frankly, it is important that they do so to avoid unintended health consequences related to COVID-19 beyond the pandemic itself. With that said, based on what we have seen to date, we do expect a small level of disruption associated with delayed diagnosis and new patient starts. This is driven by two factors. First, data from IQVIA suggests that office visits have recently declined by 30% and that interaction is not being entirely offset by the escalating use of telehealth services. We also know that benefit inquiries have declined suggesting new patient activity has slowed. The second factor is related to physician-administered drugs. For example, some infusion centers are being repurposed as COVID-19 treatment centers and there are staggered infusion times with fewer chairs to comply with social distancing practices. The extent in duration of those two factors comprised the largest variable in our pharmaceuticals outlook. However, the net of it all is that we remain confident in delivering the Pharmaceutical expectation we had in our guidance at the start of the year and anticipate the business to grow above the market again. Looking slightly ahead to next year, we also remain confident in the progression of our pipeline, which should fuel growth beyond 2020. We are partnering with health authorities on the status of our 2020 projected regulatory filings and approvals and have not received notification from regulatory authorities regarding any delays for our major submissions. We continue to progress our plans, prepared to work through any implications related to COVID-19. At this time, our major filings and approvals planned in 2020 are on track. Let\u2019s transition to consumer health. As you heard, the first quarter was very strong for this segment as our essential products are in high demand across the globe. We operate in key categories such as over-the-counter medicines that should continue to perform well as consumers look to self-manage conditions such as fever and pain. However, the first quarter surge was partially due to pantry loading that will not continue for the full year. Access to necessary consumer products across most of our portfolio will continue, but perhaps differently. There will be some impact in certain categories, as a result of reduced store traffic and social distancing behaviors that are not likely to be fully offset by higher e-commerce activity, so we expect some category softness in franchises such as skin health, most notably, sun care products. With that said, we think the upside opportunities at least offset the downside risks and are therefore projecting that here too our full year assumption in January remains intact for the segment. We continue to expect growth above the market in the U.S., while executing the SKU rationalization program mostly focused outside the U.S. So let\u2019s move on to Medical Devices, which is at the core of our guidance change and remains the most uncertain. When I referenced at the outset of this section that some companies have withdrawn guidance, it has been primarily in the medical device segment. So that is a good indication of where the uncertainty exists. Consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter, we expect our medical device business to be negatively impacted as many procedures continued to be deferred and hospital resources are diverted to address the pandemic. We are assuming the most significant negative impact occurs in the second quarter, a lingering impact but signs of stabilization in the third quarter and then some recovery in the fourth quarter. To determine the impact, we started by reviewing external data, including surveys, expert panels, epidemiology, data and capacity constraints. We then reviewed our internal data at the procedural level and weekly sales results at the country level compared to reported cases of coronavirus. Given China was the first country impacted by this pandemic and is believed to be further along in the COVID-19 curve than the rest of the world, we modeled this first. Then given the success that Japan and Korea appeared to have had thus far containing the virus, we decided to bucket all three of these Asia-Pacific markets together, which represents approximately 20% of our medical devices revenue. We then look at the remaining 7 countries in our top 10 markets, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Russia, which collectively makeup approximately 60% of our medical devices revenue. The remaining rest of the world markets outside of our top 10 countries therefore account for 20% of our medical devices revenue. As you know, we have a broad portfolio in medical devices. As this slide depicts, approximately one-third of our medical device business supports urgent procedures that aren\u2019t candidates for deferral, in other words, non-elective such as events that address trauma, stroke and critical surgeries associated with cancer. Based on this procedural classification data and the geographic split I outlined, we develop a range of scenarios to inform the low end and the high end of our estimates. In those key Asia-Pacific markets, we assume that elective procedures will decline 20% to 60% during the second quarter based on trends we are currently observing in those countries. Elective procedures could be down less than this if recovery occurs earlier and ramps backup quickly, but given how much is still unknown we felt this was an appropriate view at this time. We do see stabilization occurring earlier in these countries compared to the rest of the world and expect to start seeing deferred procedures being made up primarily throughout the second half of this year. Using similar methodologies for the other remaining major markets, we assume deferred procedures declined 65% to 85% in the second quarter and declined 20% to 60% in the third quarter versus our prior guidance. We see stabilization in the fourth quarter with these countries starting to recover deferred procedures. The rest of the world assumptions are consistent with these 7 countries. You can also see that we are assuming declines in urgent procedures as well. Individuals are spending less time outdoors engage in physical activity, which we expect to impact procedures even urgent ones, particularly in a market like trauma. In terms of recovery, if hospitals everywhere were doing procedures 24 hours a day, including weekends, they could only increase capacity by about 30%. So we have looked at that as the highest possible increase in capacity which we view as unlikely. We believe hospital systems will have capacity to makeup deferred procedures from earlier in the year, but we suspect it could take time for patients to get comfortable scheduling an elective procedure, hospitals and surgeons may still be recovering from peak COVID-19 impacts and all the economic challenges we have discussed earlier, namely a potential impact to the number of insured patients and a changing prioritization of income in the near-term. Those factors lead us to assume a recovery in a range of 0% to 15%. These assumptions are our best estimates at this time. And again, we are not assuming a recurrence or significant mutation of COVID-19. Similarly, we are not assuming potential aggressive recovery measures that maybe implemented sooner by hospitals, who are experiencing or will experience minimal COVID-19 impact faced with managing unexpected financial challenges resulting from being underutilized. As a result of all these factors, we estimate a negative operational sales impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $7 billion to the Medical Devices forecast below our prior guidance. While there are many moving parts, the impact in Medical Device is the sole change to our prior operational sales guidance for the enterprise. So let\u2019s summarize this for you. Given all the factors I have described, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the following: adjusted operational sales of minus 3% to plus 0.5% incorporating the range of the Medical Device operational sales negative impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $7 billion. Moving to operational sales, our guidance is $79.2 billion to $82.2 billion or minus 3.5% to 0%. As we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.09, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points versus the negative 50 basis points provided in our January guidance, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between minus 5.5% to minus 2.0% compared to 2019 or $77.5 billion to $80.5 billion. Moving to items impacting earnings, regarding adjusted pretax operating margin, we now expect adjusted pretax operating margin for the year to decline about a 100 basis points due to higher manufacturing costs related to COVID-19 sales impact, which is partially offset by spending reductions of approximately $2 billion. Net interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $150 million of expense due to lower rates on interest income earned. We are lowering our expectations for net other income. As mentioned earlier, our financial strength may present us with near term opportunities to execute transactions that enhance our current or future portfolio. There is another element to that strength. We are not dependent on selling assets to achieve our long-term objectives. Given the current market conditions and to ensure we create appropriate returns, we are assuming previously planned divestitures will be deferred until such time we can secure commensurate value for these very solid businesses. This decision results in us reducing our previously guided other income by $700 million to a range of $800 million to $1 billion. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 is now estimated to be approximately 16.5% to 18.0% wider than the previous range given the variability associated with the sequence and pace of economic recovery across the major regions. Given those updates, we are now comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.65 to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. This reflects an operational or constant currency decline of 11.9% to 7.3%. Again, while not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS, using exchange rates from last week, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share versus our prior guidance impact of negative $0.05. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.50 to $7.90, a range of minus 13.6% to minus 9.0% based on what we know today. A quick illustration of our EPS guidance change from January is presented here. The biggest impacts are obviously from the estimated decline in Medical Device sales and what we believe is a prudent decision to delay some previously planned divestitures. We also have some earnings impact associated with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s multifaceted leadership to combat COVID-19, from vaccine development, employee well-being and addressing healthcare worker needs, totaling close to a $0.25 billion. To help partially offset these items, we are reducing spend by approximately $2.3 billion on a pre-tax basis. But let me be clear, this is largely a reduction aligned to expenses that we believe will naturally be lower. We are not reducing important programs, initiatives or practices that best serve all stakeholders for the long-term. Our investors convey to us that they want us to continue managing for results 2, 5 and 10 years into the future. We do not provide quarterly guidance, but there are two items worth noting for you to consider as you update your models for Q2. The first is likely apparent. We expect the greatest COVID-19 impact on sales to occur in the second quarter. Second, for comparative purposes, recall that in the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a significant divestiture gain as other income. Today\u2019s revised guidance is a clear indication that a gain of that size will not occur in the second quarter of 2020. Before I hand the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A, let me thank many on the phone listening today. We appreciate the insights you have shared to enhance our thought process and while a 100% precision is not the order of the day, we hope you found the explanation of our guidance updates useful. I also want to thank our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for the extraordinary effort and dedication they have displayed these past few months. I am humbled by the magnificent leadership stories I hear on a daily basis. They serve as an inspiration. Our performance in the first quarter highlights the resiliency of our business during challenging times and showcases the commitment of our employees to advance solutions that enhance the lives of patients and consumers seeking better health. Chris, back to you to begin the Q&A portion.\nChris DelOrefice: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Good morning and thanks for all the significant work you are doing on behalf of patients in the system as well as the very significant guidance that Joe just provided. Just a couple of quick questions for me. The first for Paul just you talked extensively about the vaccine program and I know your goal is to produce 1 billion doses and you are ramping [production] [ph] throughout the year. So just first question is by the first quarter of \u201821, where do you think production capacity will be and how could that scale through 2021 relative to that 1 billion doses? And I had a quick follow-up for Joe.\nPaul Stoffels: Yes, production capacity would be ready to go at 600 million to 900 million in the first quarter going up to 1 billion in the course of the year, north of 1 billion by the end of the year. So \u2013 and that\u2019s on an annual basis. So we will have 4 manufacturing sites going on one by one bringing the whole capacity up to 1 billion in the course of the year.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very helpful, Paul. And then Joe just your detailed guidance on medical devices is very much appreciated. On consumer and pharma, obviously we saw in the first quarter some hoarding benefit in consumer and the OTC franchises and probably some stocking benefit in pharma. So those businesses for the year I appreciate are stable. Can you give us any help first to second quarter how we should be thinking about the relative trends of those businesses? Should we expect them to be below trend in second quarter versus first and then pop back up in the third quarter just based on the stocking and hoarding benefits? Thanks so much.\nJoe Wolk: Great. Sure, David. Thanks for the questions. I would say you could probably expect that in our consumer unit, you saw significant stocking across the globe probably as Chris referenced was about 7 points of additional growth for the consumer franchise. We were off to a good start, but then you saw the benefit of pantry loading. I would say in pharm remains to be seen. As you know, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. It was only worth about 1 point of growth in the quarter as some PBMs moved from 30-day refill cycles to 90 days. I would imagine that activity will still continue, but we have to see how that plays out a little bit further into the second quarter here when you have stay-at-home protocols.\nDavid Lewis: Thanks so much.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, David. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much and again appreciate all the color on the COVID dynamics, very helpful given all the uncertainty out there. So just my two questions here was one, can you just elaborate on the sensitivity of your business to elevated unemployment levels as we look past some of the near-term shutdowns. I guess we are in an environment where we have double-digit unemployment in the near-term and maybe still rates are elevated as we look out into 2021, what does that do to the business as we think about things starting to normalize? My second question was a question about China and just share a little bit about what you are seeing with the business as the economy begins to reopen there and are there any learnings we have found from China that could be helpful as we think about recoveries elsewhere in the world from what you have seen today? Thanks so much.\nChris DelOrefice: So, Chris let me take the first question with respect to how we factored unemployment into our modeling specifically around the Medical Device business and maybe I will turn it over to Alex to provide some commentary around what our team is telling us with respect to getting back to things in China. With respect to unemployment, we look back at the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 tried to draw inferences from GDP growth and what that meant relative to elective procedures and procedures in general. So we will have to see how that kind of plays out relative to the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. The team has done a nice job relying on many of the reports and surveys that you in the sell side have conducted to make some assessments, but we will really have to see how it plays out. And that\u2019s why we have widened our range much more than we have traditionally. I think at the outset of the year we had about an $800 million range on our overall enterprise sales guidance. Here you can see it\u2019s about $3 billion of a range and it\u2019s exclusively tied to medical devices. So more to come on that front, but we believe we have got at least a fairly sizable element of that already baked in. Alex, can I turn it over to you for some thoughts on China?\nAlex Gorsky: Sure, Chris. Thank you very much for the message. And look maybe before I answer that, I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, once again acknowledging the tremendous impact that this is having on citizens around the world let alone patients and consumers, this is likely one of the most significant events that any of us have ever experienced in a very personal way. And I think making sure that throughout this particularly as the world\u2019s largest healthcare products company that we remain just incredibly focused on serving them is our number one priority. I think secondly, it\u2019s really acknowledging healthcare workers. I am privileged to have a number of family members frankly who are out there on the frontline making a difference everyday. And when you see what they are doing and literally going into battle and preparing for the worst hoping for the best, working 24/7, without them, I couldn\u2019t imagine the situation we would be in. And then last but not least is the work of our employees. I am incredibly inspired you\u2019ve heard earlier the great progress, the strong progress that we have made on our vaccine program. And while Paul reviewed that perhaps in 10 minutes which is I think really important to keep into perspective is that the work that he is talking about accomplishing literally in 6 to 12 months would usually take between 5 and 7 years. And to do that in a way where there is a relentless focus on safety, on efficacy, on affordability, but also while accelerating those timelines to do everything we can to be touching as you heard in those numbers up to 1 billion people with vaccines in the course of 2021 is it\u2019s a huge undertaking and we have got people working 24/7 everyday of the week right now to really make that possible. Now as it relates to China, Chris, I think that there too it\u2019s important to acknowledge the work of our team member when we first saw this starting to break in late December, early January, we immediately assembled the team. And they began taking actions very quickly obviously to ensure the safety of our employees, but also to ensure the integrity of our supply chain and being able to support the healthcare infrastructure within China. And what we have seen over the past several weeks, I would say is a gradual return of the business. It\u2019s important to remember that in our case in addition to the economic statistics that I think many other people can share given the number of associates that we have on the ground that are literally visiting hospitals even in some more of the remote areas, we are confident that we are starting to see what I would call a reentry into procedures depending on where you are that can range from 50% to as high as 60% or 70% as of today. And there still are areas that are at the low end of that spectrum. We have also heard some comments recently about some concern about a follow-up wave or resurgence and then responding accordingly, but I think overall, we are starting to see a return to a more normal rate of surgical procedures and frankly just the provision of healthcare services vis-\u00e0-vis our pharmaceutical business and our consumer business as well. We have more than 50% of our employees back to work following very specific protocols and directives to ensure their safety, but we are confident that as we proceed in the coming months that we will see a more of return to normal continuing. Thank you.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for all the very helpful color. One question on Medical Devices and the recovery there and one on the vaccine, first on devices, Joe, could you share with us your preliminary thoughts on believe it or not 2021 just the postponed procedures, I heard your comments about the capacity and little catch up assumed for Q4. Just qualitatively, should we think about a lower base in 2020 and normalized growth in 2021 or how should we think about those postponed procedures potentially coming back next year? I had one follow-up.\nJoe Wolk: Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. As you might imagine, while we hope 2021 looks a lot like we thought it was going to look like maybe 3 months ago. We really have to let that play out. We did see and put into our modeling anywhere from normal level of procedures in the fourth quarter to a recoupment if you will of plus 15%. But it\u2019s really going to depend on the pandemic itself what\u2019s the health priorities, how are patients and consumers feeling about going to the hospital for these procedures. So I believe from what we have heard from hospital CEOs that they would like to get back into business of elective surgeries. Many of you saw recent announcements, Mayo Clinic most recently with respect to just only 25% utilization in their elective suites. That is putting financial strain on major hospital systems and we want to make sure that when we return to normal that there is good quality healthcare still in place. So I will defer I think it would be a little bit irresponsible for me at this point in time to comment on 2021. The hope and the optimism is for whenever the pandemic abates, we will be at or above expectations that we have all once had.\nLarry Biegelsen: Great.\nAlex Gorsky: Larry, Larry?\nLarry Biegelsen: Yes, Alex.\nAlex Gorsky: Larry, just one other comment on that that I think might be some important perspective is you know as Joe said and as I am sure you can appreciate over the past several weeks we have done our best to be in very close touch with hospital CEOs, with physicians who are working in systems around the country. And what we are currently saying I think is a \u2013 this was consistent with what you have seen in some recent press articles where look there are clearly areas where it has been just a relentless pace of patient care in areas like New York, areas like Northern New Jersey, other hotspots such as New Orleans, Detroit, and there are also other areas in the Midwest where you might say there are hot zones. Outside of that, however and very consistent with Joe\u2019s comments what you see in many cases are hospitals that are well under 50% of their capacity that have also increased some of their investments to the threefold sometimes more and appropriately so preparing for the absolute worst case in a pandemic. But at the same time, they have lost a very significant portion of their income, seeing a cost increase putting potential financial stress on them. And so \u2013 and we are also hearing a consistent theme of making sure that as they think about returning ensuring that we can get consumer and patient confidence back up to the right kind of testing programs, the right kind of protocols in the hospital in place to make sure that we can get healthcare professionals that is physicians, nurses, the kind of assurance that they are going to need to get back to a more normal state of working as well as in some cases given the amount of work they have been doing make sure that they have got the kind of backup resources in place to be able to do that is going to be very, very important as the healthcare systems work with governors and frankly even with Congress making sure the Cares 3 and Cares 4 are accounting for this significant strain on hospitals around the country. So I hope that\u2019s helpful.\nLarry Biegelsen: That\u2019s super helpful. Chris, if I can just get one in on the vaccine for Paul, my understanding is Moderna is targeting 4x of base immunity. Paul, what\u2019s your understanding of the base immunity in effective COVID-19 patients? What level do you think you need for an effective vaccine, what are you targeting? Thank you for taking the questions. \nPaul Stoffels: Well, I can\u2019t definitely give a scientific answer of that, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s tested yet, but what we learned in from Zika, from Ebola and from other vaccines is that we get a strong humeral, but also a cellular immunity with one injection, especially in Zika we saw that. So we think that we can get to very high level of protection with one single vaccine and that it will give us an ability to then protect for longer term, so eventually boosting 1 year later and we think would be sufficient, but we are going to study that in large scale studies in Phase 1 and that will start early September.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for all the work that you are doing during this time and for all the information for modeling. It\u2019s really appreciated. I have two questions. The first one has to do with as we think about procedures coming back in Medical Devices in your conversation with hospitals and physicians and also experienced during other economic downturns, which types of procedures generally come back first and recognizing this is a different lay of the land, but also I just want to think about ortho versus vision care versus surgical or anything that you can add there? And I will say my second question now which is in your conversation with the FDA, what are you seeing or expecting to see in terms of clinical trial enrollment and FDA product approvals? Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Okay. Hey, Joanne, this is Alex. Thank you for the first one. Look, what we are seeing in the first case and again referring to my earlier comments is I think that there is a keen sense among hospital executives and physicians of the need to try to return to a more normal state of surgery as we see our system be able to work their way through this curve and the virus. And that\u2019s being driven by the way for also a broad recognition that many of the procedures that are currently being delayed will have a healthcare impact on these patients. And we also know for example that the more of a significant hit the economy takes will likely lead to greater rates under insurance and those studies would demonstrate that in a poor economy, healthcare outcomes are poor. So these are not only economic issues, but these are actually healthcare issues driving their desire to get back to work. Also similar to Joe\u2019s point I think every system is trying to decide what does that pace look like as they have to return their operating suites, even some of their ambulatory surgery centers back to more elective procedures. That\u2019s not going to happen overnight. That\u2019s going to take some time for them to reestablish the system. I think there is clear recognition of that. And then regarding the specific procedures, look, we would expect obvious areas such as oncology in general surgery to come back sooner. We would expect there to be also certain areas in orthopedics, while elective, that can have a significant impact on mobility and overall standard of living to come back in next. And then look we think the longer term procedures perhaps cataract surgery in areas of like that, could be what I\u2019d call a third tier. We also believe that the EP, the electrophysiology business would be one that we would also see at faster return too. I mean, there is some concerning data actually regarding the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 and how that could manifest itself in some of these conditions, but at a high level, I think that\u2019s the way we are thinking about it today. Paul or Joaquin, did you want to discuss the impact on clinical timelines?\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. Thank you, Alex.\nJoe Wolk: Go ahead, Paul. Why don\u2019t you go?\nPaul Stoffels: Yes. On \u2013 first on the regulatory, there are not, at the moment, \u2013 we have not got any information from regulatory authorities that the current reviews on review timelines on our current submissions have changed. So that\u2019s going like planned. For our anticipated filings in 2020, we progress as planned and at the moment, for the submissions that are fully recruited, our deal stay unchanged. And then maybe for the submissions that are continuing to recruit patients, we will evaluate in the next few weeks. Clinical trials, we do our best \u2013 utmost best to keep going with minimal delays as we are changing sides and to less impacted areas as well as have different ways of reaching patients and working with the investigators. Alex?\nAlex Gorsky: And, Joanne, another - just one comment that I would like to make more at a global level here too is to acknowledge the great work that the FDA, and frankly, European authorities and others are making in partnering in an appropriate way to this pandemic our sense is that they have been extremely collaborative in helping to ensure that our ongoing clinical trials that patient care is not interrupted, they\u2019re working with us on how can we make, again, appropriate adjustments along the way. So we\u2019ve been really pleased by the partnering that we\u2019ve been able to have with them, and I just think it\u2019s really important to acknowledge, given all the other dynamics that are taking place right now that they\u2019re making that a priority. Joaquin?\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. I would also add that this is going to be a particularly strong year for the Pharmaceutical Group in terms of approvals and submissions. In terms of approvals, in the second half of the year, we are expecting four key line extension approvals, one being DARZALEX subcu that we expect in the second quarter, very important for us and very important driver for DARZALEX. We also are expecting TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis. it\u2019s going to give us the opportunity to be the only IL-23 with both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We are expecting SPRAVATO in major depressive disorder with suicidal intent and finally we are also expecting IMBRUVICA in frontline CLL in combo with Rituximab, so four major line extension approvals in the second half of the year. Additionally, this is going to be a very strong year for Johnson & Johnson in submissions. We submitted in the first quarter, Ponesimod, a new NME for multiple sclerosis. And we plan to have three additional submissions also during the second half of the year. One is our BCMA CAR-T in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma that has breakthrough designation. The other one, niraparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, that also has breakthrough designation. And finally, our latest one is our bispecific EGFR-cMET in non-small cell lung cancer that will be also submitted at the end of this year. That also has breakthrough designation. So, very strong year from a filing and approvals perspective for the pharmaceutical group.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Operator, we have time for two more questions. I would ask folks to keep their questions to just one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the work the company is doing on the COVID front. Would you be able to share any high-level perspective on what a framework for reopening the country looks like and maybe what are the leading indicators that you\u2019re watching here to understand if you will need to potentially adjust your guidance again? Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Yes, Terence, thank you very much and, look, I would also like to acknowledge the great work that I think our teams have done in trying to provide you with a very thoughtful balance and fact-based projection on what we\u2019re seeing in each of our markets. And again it\u2019s been extremely rigorous using a number of quantitative as well as qualitative sources to \u2013 and hopefully the kind of transparency that you are hearing and you\u2019re seeing on this call is indicative of the way we are trying to proceed to ensure that you have got as much information as possible to help understand what we are dealing with. It\u2019s difficult to predict, overall, but I would tell you that there are many efforts here in the United States, certainly, with organizations like the business roundtable there others taking place on a global basis and obviously I think everyone believes that they should start with the science and the data on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of disease progression, particularly in some of the hot spots and what you\u2019re seeing in Italy and Spain, let alone watching the ongoing issue in China with an emphasis on what could happen in a round two or round three, as well as what we\u2019re seeing here in the United States, be it in New York City, Northern New Jersey, but also relative to other places. Frankly, we\u2019re seeing some quite encouraging signs such as California and other areas. So understanding the data in terms of what is the rate of new patient infections versus the rate, for example, of discharges or deaths that are taking place, we think is an important factor. Next, it\u2019s also the availability of some of the testing kits that are available, both at the front end with antigen testing, but at the back end with antibody testing. We\u2019re really encouraged by some of the work that we\u2019re seeing in the diagnostics area and the way the companies who stepped up to try to accelerate availability. Clearly, there were some challenges early on and that are likely \u2013 continue to be some challenges but the more that we can ensure the kind of capacity really that\u2019s necessary with kits, with reagents, with swaps and in these new testing procedures, we think that, again, that\u2019s going to give citizens and others a lot more confidence. I think, third is going to be \u2013 well, likely to be in a state where it will be a combination, the testing and protocols for some time. Even as we return to work, understanding that the workplace, that our lives will be a bit different, but understanding that we can use that data and sometimes maybe even by new tracking devices in conjunction with the test kits, along with these protocols to form, what I\u2019d call, a progressive or more gradual reentry, again ensuring that we continue to build confidence, we continue to watch the data and we do that, by the way, while we\u2019re developing hopefully a therapeutic that would give us an opportunity to intervene in this disease in the coming months. As you know, the biopharmaceutical industry has invested billions of dollars over the past decade \u2013 several decades and it\u2019s not only Johnson & Johnson, other companies are doing tremendous work and working with regulators to see what can be done to accelerate that. And if we can have one or several of those in combination, perhaps, later in the summer or certainly as we head into the fall and then if we can get success with a vaccine, and again, we\u2019re certainly proud of the work that we\u2019re doing that Paul mentioned, but also by the other companies. This would give us a very comprehensive approach as soon as we head into the back end of 2020 and early 2021. This is a disease that can be managed and one that we will have a much better understanding of and hopefully be able to put behind us at the right point in time.\nChris DelOrefice: Joe, did you want to comment on leading indicators related to guidance?\nJoe Wolk: Yes, I would think it really dovetails to what Alex outlined there in terms of returning to work, opening up the economy. We\u2019re going to look for those same telltale signs, how safe is the environment at large with respect to people\u2019s comfort level to going back, being in social settings, going to hospitals to get procedures that they would \u2013 might otherwise defer during a time like this. So we\u2019ll continue to watch those on each weekly basis and the volume that comes through our major markets.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Terence. Appreciate the question. Rob, last question please.\nOperator: The last question is from Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So first question I have for you is could you provide more color on your variable cost structure and what\u2019s in that $2.3 billion decline in spend for this year? And then secondly, how should we think about cash flow for 2020 and 2021 in light of your new guidance? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Thanks for the questions, Louise. So with respect to what\u2019s in the $2.3 billion that I referenced in my prepared remarks. Those are expenses that we expect to naturally fall out as a result of the social distancing or stay-at-home measures, the work-from-home measures that have been instituted across the globe. So think of those in categories such as travel, company meetings. There will be some project delays naturally when people aren\u2019t on site to execute them. I want to be very clear though, we are not rushing to judgment and cutting valuable scientific programs, valuable initiatives within our commercial capabilities or programs that benefit our employees to manage our P&L in the short term. As you heard me say, we think we are very well-positioned for the long term. You heard from Paul, Alex and Joaquin that our clinical trials for our major submissions this year continue to be on track. We are not looking to disrupt this. So we talk to investors regularly. They want us managing for two, five, 10 years out with a long term perspective. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re living into. We think that\u2019s appropriate given with the guidance we provided today and should the need arise, we will look to of course correct as appropriate. With respect to our cash flow, clearly, we will have a little bit of a hit to our original projections. But as a reminder, we are a strong generator of cash flow. Last year, we had an all-time high of about $20 billion in cash flow. We were still up very well into the teens this year in all of our projections. We will see how it plays out relative to this guidance. But we are very well-positioned with $18 billion of cash and access to credit markets, should we need them on a short term basis. But we feel very comfortable with the position, not just for getting through 2020, but then being very strong into 2021.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Louise. Appreciate the question. Thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. Apologies, I know we weren\u2019t able to get to a lot of you, but certainly the Investor Relations team is happy to engage with you in more detailed discussions and we appreciate your time on the call today. We hope you find this information valuable and I will now turn the call over to Alex just for some final comments.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey, thank you, once again, everybody, for your time and the work that you\u2019re doing and I want to end where we started by once again acknowledging the significant impact this is having on citizens, on patients, on consumers around the world. We also believe that this demonstrates the importance of healthcare in everyone\u2019s lives, the impact that it has in a very personal way on people, on families, but also the impact that it has on countries, on economies, on almost every aspect of our lives. And what I can absolutely commit to you is that when we say that at Johnson & Johnson, we are built for time like this, it\u2019s out of humility, knowing the important role that we play and ensuring healthcare is available and accessible in a way where we can truly make a difference for billions of people around the world. So thank you very much. And we will look forward to our upcoming discussions and updates in the coming weeks and months. Bye everybody stay safe and stay healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Alex Gorsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I also want to thank Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels for joining our first quarter webcast. As the Vice Chairs of Johnson & Johnson and given the leadership role they are playing as we mobilize our efforts and resources across the company to address COVID-19, I thought it would be helpful to have both of them available to answer potential questions and convey key information. Paul will also share more detailed perspective in his prepared commentary which will follow my remarks. Clearly, COVID-19 is at the forefront of everyone's mind, which is why we plan to spend a fair amount of time during the earnings webcast discussing this unprecedented global pandemic, the profound impact it is having on global public health, and our unwavering commitment to create and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Johnson & Johnson was built for times like this and our strong first quarter results are just one reflection of our sustainable business model. Our Johnson & Johnson colleagues remain focused on delivering on the commitments and responsibilities to our patients, doctors, nurses, employees, parents, children, communities and shareholders as defined in our Credo. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $1.01 which is another reflection of our stability and further underscores our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. This marks the 58th consecutive year of dividend increases for Johnson & Johnson and we believe that taking this action is the right thing to do for our shareholders at this time and importantly a strong example of the confidence we have in our business now and in the future. Given Chris and Joe will discuss our first quarter performance and outlook in greater detail, I would like to take just a few minutes to highlight four pillars of strength that reinforce why Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. These pillars serve as the foundation of our resiliency and response to the current COVID-19 crisis and provide the dynamic foundation for Johnson & Johnson to continue to build a stronger, healthier and successful future for all of our stakeholders. And we recognize the challenges that individuals, companies and the world are facing right now. As we look forward, we are confident that together we will win this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and we are maintaining a long-term view of optimism. The first pillar is our longstanding belief in driving both performance and purpose with equal commitment. Across Johnson & Johnson, we operate with the belief there is a tightly linked connection between our company's purpose, which is to advance health for humanity and our financial performance which has helped us deliver lifesaving medicines and lifesaving products as well as invest and support communities around the world. We recognize the challenges that families and their loved ones are facing in these volatile and unpredictable times and this is exactly why across our enterprise we have been working so hard our help those in need and to accelerate our collective efforts towards ending this pandemic. Some examples of note include, we are applying all of our capabilities to support nurses, doctors, midwives and community health workers. Recently, it was announced that Johnson & Johnson family of companies and the Johnson & Johnson Foundation are increasing our previous $250 million commitment over 10 years by an additional $50 million for immediate COVID-19 response. This contribution will primarily focus on supporting frontline health workers who are truly modern day heroes and the backbone of the healthcare system. We are also working diligently to convert manufacturing lines of several facilities around the world for products most in need during the pandemic so we can continue to provide important medicines and products to patients. The second pillar I want to highlight is of strategic advantage of being the most broadly based healthcare company in the industry. Leading across the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices segments provides us with the unique and powerful perspective that enables us to see more, reach more, learn more and do more across the full spectrum of health as well as throughout every age and stage of our patients and consumers' lives. In fact, in our pharmaceutical business, we are thrilled to have identified a lead candidate for a potential vaccine. In consumer, Tylenol is one of our most iconic and trusted brands by consumers and healthcare professional for reducing fever and we have increased production running our Tylenol manufacturing plant 24/7 to maximize supply. We have also refocused our manufacturing lines to make our easiest-to-produce pills, which are the white Tylenol caplets, so we can increase production and throughput. In Medical Devices, we are experiencing a near term negative impact and expect this to continue while elective procedures are deferred and hospital resources are redeployed to address patients impacted by this pandemic. That said, Medical Devices has historically been a strong market and we believe the underlying fundamentals of the market remain intact. We continue to see tremendous potential over the long-term to serve our patients and customers. And at this time, and in this time of need, we are utilizing our supply chain delivery in 3D printing expertise in collaboration with Prisma Health to manufacture and distribute the VESper ventilator expansion splitter device, which addresses the acute ventilator shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic and at no cost to healthcare providers. Additionally, we continue to support and share product availability to healthcare workers, hospital systems and surgeons in critical need areas such as trauma, stroke and other life saving surgeries that cannot be deferred. The third pillar is our unparalleled scientific expertise. Innovation is integral to our ability to deliver breakthrough healthcare solutions and the remarkable and ambitious work that we have underway to eradicate COVID-19 is a true testament to this fact. Based on 134 years of experience, we know that the power of our science, the scale of our business and the dedication of our employees is critical in driving innovative solutions that can change people's lives for the better and change the face of healthcare. In collaboration with scientists from various external institutions, we have been able to identify a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate. We will leverage the scientific expertise of our internal teams with a decade of work spend developing vaccines for HIV, Zika and Ebola to apply the groundbreaking science and scalable manufacturing platform that we already have in place. This is monumental and is much needed. We are accelerating timelines and plan to begin production at risk imminently. And we are committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The fourth and last pillar is the world-class talent, capabilities and dedication of our 132,000 colleagues worldwide. We always take actions and employee tactics to support our Johnson & Johnson colleagues, both professionally and personally, to ensure they are safe and well equipped and today is no different. We are ensuring employees are able to play their part in helping to fight the COVID-19 outbreak at home and at work. Some examples include we've implemented significantly enhanced sanitizing procedures and appropriate distancing to ensure we maintain safe, clean and well functioning facilities across our manufacturing, distribution centers and research and development sites. We are rolling out a one-time award of $1000 per essential employee with cost of living adjustments globally whose presence is required on site to recognize the extraordinary work these employees are doing to advance our science and ensure supply of our most essential products and medicines. We are providing 100% of base salary and benefits through April 30 to employees who are primary caregivers and are unable to work remotely due to COVID-related family care responsibilities, underlying health issues, connectivity issues or other unique circumstances. And we are granting up to 14 weeks of paid leave to employees around the world with medical training who volunteer or who are called to serve the communities in diagnosing, treating and providing health support related to COVID-19. And underpinning each of these four pillars is our Credo. Our Credo has been a source of both inspiration and confidence for me and my Johnson & Johnson colleagues, especially in times like these. For more than 75 years, our Credo has been the moral compass that guides our business decisions and it's the blueprint that outlines how we operate and care for the world. Guided by our Credo and unyielding sense of purpose, we have created a powerful legacy of improving the health and well-being of people worldwide, while delivering sustainable long-term value to all of our stakeholders. We have a century plus history of leading in times of great challenge. We have done it before and we can do it again. This is what the world expects of us and this is what we are all committed to, and prepared to do. Now as the world continues to face the significant and urgent public health crisis, I want to emphasize that across Johnson & Johnson, we are leveraging our broad base, size and scale to think, lead and operate with the same level of incredible urgency relying on the same courage, conviction and core strengths that set us apart and empower us to make a positive impact on society and healthcare. I am both proud and amazed at the level of dedication that I've witnessed from every Johnson & Johnson business, function, team and person over the last several weeks. Now, we certainly don't have all the answers today. We'll find the ones needed to ensure our success for tomorrow and we won't take shortcuts to compromise our standards or values as we move with speed and determination. As I said earlier, Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. We take a long-term strategic view, which means we're in this for the long haul delivering value to all of our stakeholders. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I'll now turn it over to Paul, who will provide an update on the progress we're making with the COVID-19 vaccine development. Thank you. Paul? Sure, Chris. Thank you very much for the message. And look maybe before I answer that, I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, once again acknowledging the tremendous impact that this is having on citizens around the world let alone patients and consumers, this is likely one of the most significant events that any of us have ever experienced in a very personal way. And I think making sure that throughout this particularly as the world's largest healthcare products company that we remain just incredibly focused on serving them is our number one priority. I think secondly, it's really acknowledging healthcare workers. I am privileged to have a number of family members frankly who are out there on the frontline making a difference everyday. And when you see what they are doing and literally going into battle and preparing for the worst hoping for the best, working 24/7, without them, I couldn't imagine the situation we would be in. And then last but not least is the work of our employees. I am incredibly inspired you've heard earlier the great progress, the strong progress that we have made on our vaccine program. And while Paul reviewed that perhaps in 10 minutes which is I think really important to keep into perspective is that the work that he is talking about accomplishing literally in 6 to 12 months would usually take between 5 and 7 years. And to do that in a way where there is a relentless focus on safety, on efficacy, on affordability, but also while accelerating those timelines to do everything we can to be touching as you heard in those numbers up to 1 billion people with vaccines in the course of 2021 is it's a huge undertaking and we have got people working 24/7 everyday of the week right now to really make that possible. Now as it relates to China, Chris, I think that there too it's important to acknowledge the work of our team member when we first saw this starting to break in late December, early January, we immediately assembled the team. And they began taking actions very quickly obviously to ensure the safety of our employees, but also to ensure the integrity of our supply chain and being able to support the healthcare infrastructure within China. And what we have seen over the past several weeks, I would say is a gradual return of the business. It's important to remember that in our case in addition to the economic statistics that I think many other people can share given the number of associates that we have on the ground that are literally visiting hospitals even in some more of the remote areas, we are confident that we are starting to see what I would call a reentry into procedures depending on where you are that can range from 50% to as high as 60% or 70% as of today. And there still are areas that are at the low end of that spectrum. We have also heard some comments recently about some concern about a follow-up wave or resurgence and then responding accordingly, but I think overall, we are starting to see a return to a more normal rate of surgical procedures and frankly just the provision of healthcare services vis-a\u0300-vis our pharmaceutical business and our consumer business as well. We have more than 50% of our employees back to work following very specific protocols and directives to ensure their safety, but we are confident that as we proceed in the coming months that we will see a more of return to normal continuing. Thank you. Larry, Larry? Larry, just one other comment on that that I think might be some important perspective is you know as Joe said and as I am sure you can appreciate over the past several weeks we have done our best to be in very close touch with hospital CEOs, with physicians who are working in systems around the country. And what we are currently saying I think is a \u2013 this was consistent with what you have seen in some recent press articles where look there are clearly areas where it has been just a relentless pace of patient care in areas like New York, areas like Northern New Jersey, other hotspots such as New Orleans, Detroit, and there are also other areas in the Midwest where you might say there are hot zones. Outside of that, however and very consistent with Joe's comments what you see in many cases are hospitals that are well under 50% of their capacity that have also increased some of their investments to the threefold sometimes more and appropriately so preparing for the absolute worst case in a pandemic. But at the same time, they have lost a very significant portion of their income, seeing a cost increase putting potential financial stress on them. And so \u2013 and we are also hearing a consistent theme of making sure that as they think about returning ensuring that we can get consumer and patient confidence back up to the right kind of testing programs, the right kind of protocols in the hospital in place to make sure that we can get healthcare professionals that is physicians, nurses, the kind of assurance that they are going to need to get back to a more normal state of working as well as in some cases given the amount of work they have been doing make sure that they have got the kind of backup resources in place to be able to do that is going to be very, very important as the healthcare systems work with governors and frankly even with Congress making sure the Cares 3 and Cares 4 are accounting for this significant strain on hospitals around the country. So I hope that's helpful. Okay. Hey, Joanne, this is Alex. Thank you for the first one. Look, what we are seeing in the first case and again referring to my earlier comments is I think that there is a keen sense among hospital executives and physicians of the need to try to return to a more normal state of surgery as we see our system be able to work their way through this curve and the virus. And that's being driven by the way for also a broad recognition that many of the procedures that are currently being delayed will have a healthcare impact on these patients. And we also know for example that the more of a significant hit the economy takes will likely lead to greater rates under insurance and those studies would demonstrate that in a poor economy, healthcare outcomes are poor. So these are not only economic issues, but these are actually healthcare issues driving their desire to get back to work. Also similar to Joe's point I think every system is trying to decide what does that pace look like as they have to return their operating suites, even some of their ambulatory surgery centers back to more elective procedures. That's not going to happen overnight. That's going to take some time for them to reestablish the system. I think there is clear recognition of that. And then regarding the specific procedures, look, we would expect obvious areas such as oncology in general surgery to come back sooner. We would expect there to be also certain areas in orthopedics, while elective, that can have a significant impact on mobility and overall standard of living to come back in next. And then look we think the longer term procedures perhaps cataract surgery in areas of like that, could be what I'd call a third tier. We also believe that the EP, the electrophysiology business would be one that we would also see at faster return too. I mean, there is some concerning data actually regarding the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 and how that could manifest itself in some of these conditions, but at a high level, I think that's the way we are thinking about it today. Paul or Joaquin, did you want to discuss the impact on clinical timelines? And, Joanne, another - just one comment that I would like to make more at a global level here too is to acknowledge the great work that the FDA, and frankly, European authorities and others are making in partnering in an appropriate way to this pandemic our sense is that they have been extremely collaborative in helping to ensure that our ongoing clinical trials that patient care is not interrupted, they're working with us on how can we make, again, appropriate adjustments along the way. So we've been really pleased by the partnering that we've been able to have with them, and I just think it's really important to acknowledge, given all the other dynamics that are taking place right now that they're making that a priority. Joaquin? Yes, Terence, thank you very much and, look, I would also like to acknowledge the great work that I think our teams have done in trying to provide you with a very thoughtful balance and fact-based projection on what we're seeing in each of our markets. And again it's been extremely rigorous using a number of quantitative as well as qualitative sources to \u2013 and hopefully the kind of transparency that you are hearing and you're seeing on this call is indicative of the way we are trying to proceed to ensure that you have got as much information as possible to help understand what we are dealing with. It's difficult to predict, overall, but I would tell you that there are many efforts here in the United States, certainly, with organizations like the business roundtable there others taking place on a global basis and obviously I think everyone believes that they should start with the science and the data on what we're seeing in terms of disease progression, particularly in some of the hot spots and what you're seeing in Italy and Spain, let alone watching the ongoing issue in China with an emphasis on what could happen in a round two or round three, as well as what we're seeing here in the United States, be it in New York City, Northern New Jersey, but also relative to other places. Frankly, we're seeing some quite encouraging signs such as California and other areas. So understanding the data in terms of what is the rate of new patient infections versus the rate, for example, of discharges or deaths that are taking place, we think is an important factor. Next, it's also the availability of some of the testing kits that are available, both at the front end with antigen testing, but at the back end with antibody testing. We're really encouraged by some of the work that we're seeing in the diagnostics area and the way the companies who stepped up to try to accelerate availability. Clearly, there were some challenges early on and that are likely \u2013 continue to be some challenges but the more that we can ensure the kind of capacity really that's necessary with kits, with reagents, with swaps and in these new testing procedures, we think that, again, that's going to give citizens and others a lot more confidence. I think, third is going to be \u2013 well, likely to be in a state where it will be a combination, the testing and protocols for some time. Even as we return to work, understanding that the workplace, that our lives will be a bit different, but understanding that we can use that data and sometimes maybe even by new tracking devices in conjunction with the test kits, along with these protocols to form, what I'd call, a progressive or more gradual reentry, again ensuring that we continue to build confidence, we continue to watch the data and we do that, by the way, while we're developing hopefully a therapeutic that would give us an opportunity to intervene in this disease in the coming months. As you know, the biopharmaceutical industry has invested billions of dollars over the past decade \u2013 several decades and it's not only Johnson & Johnson, other companies are doing tremendous work and working with regulators to see what can be done to accelerate that. And if we can have one or several of those in combination, perhaps, later in the summer or certainly as we head into the fall and then if we can get success with a vaccine, and again, we're certainly proud of the work that we're doing that Paul mentioned, but also by the other companies. This would give us a very comprehensive approach as soon as we head into the back end of 2020 and early 2021. This is a disease that can be managed and one that we will have a much better understanding of and hopefully be able to put behind us at the right point in time. Hey, thank you, once again, everybody, for your time and the work that you're doing and I want to end where we started by once again acknowledging the significant impact this is having on citizens, on patients, on consumers around the world. We also believe that this demonstrates the importance of healthcare in everyone's lives, the impact that it has in a very personal way on people, on families, but also the impact that it has on countries, on economies, on almost every aspect of our lives. And what I can absolutely commit to you is that when we say that at Johnson & Johnson, we are built for time like this, it's out of humility, knowing the important role that we play and ensuring healthcare is available and accessible in a way where we can truly make a difference for billions of people around the world. So thank you very much. And we will look forward to our upcoming discussions and updates in the coming weeks and months. Bye everybody stay safe and stay healthy."

            "content": "Thank you, Alex. I'm pleased to provide an update on a multi-pronged approach to addressing COVID-19 including developing a vaccine and screening of compound libraries to identify potential new treatments to address this pandemic. In addition, we are exploring immunomodulators to protect against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS in COVID-19. While we focus today on finding potential new treatments, ultimately a vaccine is key to eradicating the ongoing threat of the pandemic. Since 2011, Johnson & Johnson has invested heavily to build state-of-the-art vaccine capabilities which we used to develop and manufacture our Ebola, Zika, RSV and HIV vaccine candidates. We are bringing to bear those same capabilities to rapidly accelerate our efforts towards the potential COVID-19 vaccine. We are pleased to see that there are many approaches to vaccines for COVID-19 which show the importance of ongoing research in industry over the past several decades. Our COVID-19 vaccine program leverages Janssen Adeno vector and PER. C6 technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. Based on the WHO criteria for key attributes for prioritizing vaccine platforms, here on the right, the attributes of our platform put us in a leadership position. First, our Adeno26 viral vector platform induces potent and long lasting humoral and cellular immune responses in humans. Further this approach has very low to no risk on the respiratory disease enhancement based on the immune responses observed across our programs. This is in line with the observation that targeted preclinical models used in context of the RSV vaccine development have shown that this platform is not associated with enhanced respiratory disease. Our platform has a proven safety profile. More than 50,000 people have been vaccinated and we have demonstrated that it's well tolerated. Our PER.C6 cell line offers a high yielding vaccine manufacturing platform and is scalable and fully industrialized providing us the ability to make hundreds of millions of vaccines per year. Capacity in our Leiden-based vaccines launch facility is as high as 300 million doses per year. Finally, we have 2 to 8 Celsius stability data on our vaccine making it compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels and therefore will not require new infrastructure to get it to the people who need it. We began working on a vaccine candidate in early January as soon as the coronavirus sequence became first available. As you can see in the infographic on the right, to make vaccine candidates, we insert a piece of the spike protein into the genome of a non-replicating and therefore non-infective adenovirus, a type of common cold virus. The research teams at Janssen in collaboration with BIDMC at Harvard Medical School constructed and tested multiple vaccine candidates. The vaccine constructs were tested then to identify those with most promise in producing an immune response in pre-clinical testing. Based on this work, Johnson & Johnson announced for March 30 that we have identified the lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate along with two backups. In order for any vaccine to be manufacture to GMP in large quantities, it is necessary to first produce a Master Seed bank which is den for genitive of all future large scale vaccination batches. All three candidates are now entering pre-Master Seed production. Final selection of start of Master Seed production is expected in June 2020. As we have already announced, we are expanding our global manufacturing capacity in parallel, including the establishment of a new U.S. vaccine manufacturing capability. We are also in discussions with other potential partners to expand manufacturing capacity in Europe and Asia and look forward to making those announcements in the coming weeks. We plan to begin production at risk imminently and our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally. We are on track to start Phase 1 clinical trials in early September in the U.S. and Europe with clinical data on safety and immunogenicity expected to be available by the end of the year. This could allow vaccine availability for emergency use authorization as early as early 2021. We are confident in this vaccine candidate because we have now seen good data in animal models. While we are moving with extreme speeds, we are absolutely committed to making sure that our vaccine follows all guidelines with regard to good manufacturing practices and quality controls. We are not cutting any corners when it comes to safety. We are able to achieve the speed because we are doing several processes in parallel many at risk rather than in sequence. In addition to our work on vaccines we are screening compound libraries, including compounds from Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies to identify potential treatments against COVID-19 and exploring immunomodulators to protect against ARDS. The antiviral screening efforts are being conducted in partnership with the Rega Institute at the University of Leuven in Belgium. As I mentioned, we have been able to reach this point as a result of multiple collaborations. As you also saw in the March 30 announcement as part of our new partnership with BARDA, we have together committed more than $1 billion of investment to co-fund vaccine research, development, clinical testing and accelerated manufacturing. If a vaccine is approved, we will work with relevant healthcare authorities to ensure that our products are accessible wherever needed. We are committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. In conclusion, I want to note that COVID-19 is one of the most severe global health challenges we have seen in our lifetimes, but at the same time, we have unprecedented science and technology available today to help us mount a false and effective response. Johnson & Johnson is committed to harnessing the latest tools sharing knowledge and resources and fueling global collaborations to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. Now, I will turn it over to Chris to discuss our results for the quarter. Thank you. Yes, production capacity would be ready to go at 600 million to 900 million in the first quarter going up to 1 billion in the course of the year, north of 1 billion by the end of the year. So \u2013 and that's on an annual basis. So we will have 4 manufacturing sites going on one by one bringing the whole capacity up to 1 billion in the course of the year. Well, I can't definitely give a scientific answer of that, because I don't think that's tested yet, but what we learned in from Zika, from Ebola and from other vaccines is that we get a strong humeral, but also a cellular immunity with one injection, especially in Zika we saw that. So we think that we can get to very high level of protection with one single vaccine and that it will give us an ability to then protect for longer term, so eventually boosting 1 year later and we think would be sufficient, but we are going to study that in large scale studies in Phase 1 and that will start early September. Yes. On \u2013 first on the regulatory, there are not, at the moment, \u2013 we have not got any information from regulatory authorities that the current reviews on review timelines on our current submissions have changed. So that's going like planned. For our anticipated filings in 2020, we progress as planned and at the moment, for the submissions that are fully recruited, our deal stay unchanged. And then maybe for the submissions that are continuing to recruit patients, we will evaluate in the next few weeks. Clinical trials, we do our best \u2013 utmost best to keep going with minimal delays as we are changing sides and to less impacted areas as well as have different ways of reaching patients and working with the investigators. Alex?"

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. We appreciate that you decided to join the call today unlike others on this call who spoke before me, I hope you and those close to you are safe and healthy. Let me state right upfront, the fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson's business are strong and our expectations of where the business is heading have not changed combating the current crisis is anything but usual. However, many aspects of Johnson & Johnson continued to operate with a business as usual focus such as advancing breakthrough innovation, fostering consumer and patient access and being financially disciplined. We are motivated by never stopping when it comes to taking care of you, our stakeholders and we can have a profound positive impact, because we are built to lead, built to last and quite frankly, built for times like this. My central focus in today's prepared remarks is twofold. First, I will share with you our ongoing business continuity plans. It is important particularly in times of challenge that you understand the steps we have put in place recently and over a number of years to ensure reliable supply of the important products we provide. Second, I will outline how we are thinking about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and what that will have on our near-term financial performance in the context of changes from the guidance we issued in January. I trust at the end of the my remarks and at the end of this call, the obvious conclusion is that Johnson & Johnson is strong in a financial position to meet its obligation to all stakeholders and poised for many years of success. The fundamentals of our business are intact. As Alex mentioned earlier, as the most broadly based global company in the healthcare industry, we have established a sustainable and resilient business model with flexibility designed into our research, manufacturing and commercial capabilities. We have robust active business continuity plans across our network, which have been instrumental in preparing us for events like COVID-19. Some steps we have taken recently include leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers to address high risk areas and ensure adequate and effective distribution, working closely with suppliers, distributors, local governments and regulatory to gain better insights to address their concerns through our commercial organizations supporting healthcare providers in the safest way possible by moving to virtual connections to serve as a resource for physicians. Where needed, we directly engage to support them in areas like trauma surgeries ensuring we follow all health protocols to keep everyone safe. Within clinical operations, our first priority is always to protect the health and well-being of participants currently enrolled in our clinical trials. Our next priority is to complete these trials in a manner to fully satisfy regulatory requirements. This pandemic does not change these priorities. As a result of these efforts, we are able to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs. Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to provide insights on a few topics that we typically don't detail, but are likely top of mind these days for most. From a liquidity standpoint, we are well positioned. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $18 billion generating approximately $3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter consistent with first quarters of the previous two years. Coupled with our AAA credit rating, we are able to access the capital markets if needed and would anticipate securing the most competitive credit spreads available. A strong balance sheet has been a hallmark of Johnson & Johnson and is most valued in times of macroeconomic distress. We are able to use this strength to benefit many constituents. Some recent examples include partnering with BARDA to jointly invest approximately $1 billion to not only develop and deliver a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, but potentially, in record time. We are complementing the efforts of communities and healthcare heroes through numerous donations and other activities which Alex highlighted. We are supporting small and diverse suppliers and customers, offering financial flexibility at a time when they need it most and we responsibly increased our dividend to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities are clear and remain unchanged. We continue to invest in our business with a bias towards innovation that delivers meaningful products and services to address unmet needs or commercial capabilities that generate greater access to healthy living for more people. It is investing in innovation, particularly in times of uncertainty that will not just bridge the next few months, but the next several years. After investing at or above competitive levels in our business, we look to allocate capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We know that many of our shareholders prioritize that aspect when investing in Johnson & Johnson. Alex announced earlier in the call that for the 58th straight year, we are increasing our dividend. While certainly notable from a historical standpoint, this announcement is important in that it underscores our confidence and optimism for the future. We intend to continue generating strong cash flows and be financially well positioned. Our next priority is to invest our capital in value creating M&A, pursuing transactions that bolster our portfolio or enhance our pipeline while targeting returns that compensate shareholders for the risk we are bearing on their behalf. The current crisis does not reduce our desire to do these transactions. In fact, given our financial strength, we may be in a better position to fund opportunities that will augment sustainable long-term growth. While a second quarter event, a good example of this in practice, is our recently signed preclinical research collaboration with Fate Therapeutics to develop and commercialize off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapies for up to four tumor-associated antigens, which we believe has the potential to significantly change the current cell therapy paradigm in the treatment of several distinct cancer types. Finally, within our capital allocation paradigm, as you saw the past few years, we also simultaneously allocate capital to share repurchase programs. We do not have an active program at this time and have no plans to announce a new program as we feel other capital allocation priorities take precedence at this time. Given it is often a question, let me offer a few remarks related to ongoing litigation. With respect to opioids, as announced last October, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigations. The state attorneys generals are engaged and there continues to be cooperation working towards broad participation by the states, cities and counties involved in this litigation. Regarding Talc, as we have previously stated, multiple sources of independent science and third-party testing supports the safety of our products. We await the Daubert hearing outcomes from Judge Wolfson in the Federal District Court of New Jersey. Okay. Let's move to our guidance for 2020. We know some companies in our peer set have pulled their guidance. We also know that some sell side models have not been updated. We understand that may have been an option for us as well, but in uncertain times, we look forward to offering you as much transparency and credible insight into our view of our business. We have decided to provide updated guidance, given what we know today, with the objective of finding that right balance between bolstering your confidence in Johnson & Johnson, while not providing false assurances. Things will change in the coming days, weeks and months, but at least, still have the benefit of our perspective to consider among the numerous sources you rely upon to make financial sense of the near term outlook. During the next few minutes, I will touch upon each part of our business with greater emphasis on Medical Devices. That segment is currently projected to experience the most significant impact. Let me start, however, by sharing a few assumptions that apply across our entire business. Our guidance attempts to account for the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and the potential impact it will have on the overall healthcare system capturing the potential negative impact on the number of insured individuals and how people may prioritize disposable income in the near term. Second, utilizing the experience in earlier affected markets as a reference, our estimates of the COVID-19 impact assume the relative shape of the COVID-19 curve as being more of an acute shorter-term impact rather than a prolonged impact. For our largest market, the U.S., this assumption is consistent with the estimated mid-April peak assumed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation or IHME. The IHME also predicts mid-to-late April peaks for several European countries. Third, taking into account recent statements by Dr. Fauci and other scientifically accomplished sources, our estimates do not assume the virus returns in the fall with the same intensity currently experienced. What do I mean by that? As the experts have noted in various forums, if the virus does return, the world should be much better prepared to test, identify and isolate it. There may also be therapeutic options available. So, our premise is that elective procedures and doctor visits will largely be permissible in the second half of this year. Finally, we assume a recovery for procedures that begins in the third quarter and improves further in the fourth quarter. We do anticipate some disruption to the economy and have considered it on a smaller scale. Coming out of the second quarter, we assume an improving global economy with lower unemployment, better insurance coverage and higher procedure capacity than what has been or will be experienced at peak. Let's delve into the segments. The story for Pharmaceuticals is fairly straightforward. Our results in the first quarter confirm the strength of our Pharmaceutical business and we expect it to be resilient. We provide valuable solutions in critical disease states with high unmet need and we largely expect patients will continue to receive and seek treatment. Quite frankly, it is important that they do so to avoid unintended health consequences related to COVID-19 beyond the pandemic itself. With that said, based on what we have seen to date, we do expect a small level of disruption associated with delayed diagnosis and new patient starts. This is driven by two factors. First, data from IQVIA suggests that office visits have recently declined by 30% and that interaction is not being entirely offset by the escalating use of telehealth services. We also know that benefit inquiries have declined suggesting new patient activity has slowed. The second factor is related to physician-administered drugs. For example, some infusion centers are being repurposed as COVID-19 treatment centers and there are staggered infusion times with fewer chairs to comply with social distancing practices. The extent in duration of those two factors comprised the largest variable in our pharmaceuticals outlook. However, the net of it all is that we remain confident in delivering the Pharmaceutical expectation we had in our guidance at the start of the year and anticipate the business to grow above the market again. Looking slightly ahead to next year, we also remain confident in the progression of our pipeline, which should fuel growth beyond 2020. We are partnering with health authorities on the status of our 2020 projected regulatory filings and approvals and have not received notification from regulatory authorities regarding any delays for our major submissions. We continue to progress our plans, prepared to work through any implications related to COVID-19. At this time, our major filings and approvals planned in 2020 are on track. Let's transition to consumer health. As you heard, the first quarter was very strong for this segment as our essential products are in high demand across the globe. We operate in key categories such as over-the-counter medicines that should continue to perform well as consumers look to self-manage conditions such as fever and pain. However, the first quarter surge was partially due to pantry loading that will not continue for the full year. Access to necessary consumer products across most of our portfolio will continue, but perhaps differently. There will be some impact in certain categories, as a result of reduced store traffic and social distancing behaviors that are not likely to be fully offset by higher e-commerce activity, so we expect some category softness in franchises such as skin health, most notably, sun care products. With that said, we think the upside opportunities at least offset the downside risks and are therefore projecting that here too our full year assumption in January remains intact for the segment. We continue to expect growth above the market in the U.S., while executing the SKU rationalization program mostly focused outside the U.S. So let's move on to Medical Devices, which is at the core of our guidance change and remains the most uncertain. When I referenced at the outset of this section that some companies have withdrawn guidance, it has been primarily in the medical device segment. So that is a good indication of where the uncertainty exists. Consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter, we expect our medical device business to be negatively impacted as many procedures continued to be deferred and hospital resources are diverted to address the pandemic. We are assuming the most significant negative impact occurs in the second quarter, a lingering impact but signs of stabilization in the third quarter and then some recovery in the fourth quarter. To determine the impact, we started by reviewing external data, including surveys, expert panels, epidemiology, data and capacity constraints. We then reviewed our internal data at the procedural level and weekly sales results at the country level compared to reported cases of coronavirus. Given China was the first country impacted by this pandemic and is believed to be further along in the COVID-19 curve than the rest of the world, we modeled this first. Then given the success that Japan and Korea appeared to have had thus far containing the virus, we decided to bucket all three of these Asia-Pacific markets together, which represents approximately 20% of our medical devices revenue. We then look at the remaining 7 countries in our top 10 markets, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Russia, which collectively makeup approximately 60% of our medical devices revenue. The remaining rest of the world markets outside of our top 10 countries therefore account for 20% of our medical devices revenue. As you know, we have a broad portfolio in medical devices. As this slide depicts, approximately one-third of our medical device business supports urgent procedures that aren't candidates for deferral, in other words, non-elective such as events that address trauma, stroke and critical surgeries associated with cancer. Based on this procedural classification data and the geographic split I outlined, we develop a range of scenarios to inform the low end and the high end of our estimates. In those key Asia-Pacific markets, we assume that elective procedures will decline 20% to 60% during the second quarter based on trends we are currently observing in those countries. Elective procedures could be down less than this if recovery occurs earlier and ramps backup quickly, but given how much is still unknown we felt this was an appropriate view at this time. We do see stabilization occurring earlier in these countries compared to the rest of the world and expect to start seeing deferred procedures being made up primarily throughout the second half of this year. Using similar methodologies for the other remaining major markets, we assume deferred procedures declined 65% to 85% in the second quarter and declined 20% to 60% in the third quarter versus our prior guidance. We see stabilization in the fourth quarter with these countries starting to recover deferred procedures. The rest of the world assumptions are consistent with these 7 countries. You can also see that we are assuming declines in urgent procedures as well. Individuals are spending less time outdoors engage in physical activity, which we expect to impact procedures even urgent ones, particularly in a market like trauma. In terms of recovery, if hospitals everywhere were doing procedures 24 hours a day, including weekends, they could only increase capacity by about 30%. So we have looked at that as the highest possible increase in capacity which we view as unlikely. We believe hospital systems will have capacity to makeup deferred procedures from earlier in the year, but we suspect it could take time for patients to get comfortable scheduling an elective procedure, hospitals and surgeons may still be recovering from peak COVID-19 impacts and all the economic challenges we have discussed earlier, namely a potential impact to the number of insured patients and a changing prioritization of income in the near-term. Those factors lead us to assume a recovery in a range of 0% to 15%. These assumptions are our best estimates at this time. And again, we are not assuming a recurrence or significant mutation of COVID-19. Similarly, we are not assuming potential aggressive recovery measures that maybe implemented sooner by hospitals, who are experiencing or will experience minimal COVID-19 impact faced with managing unexpected financial challenges resulting from being underutilized. As a result of all these factors, we estimate a negative operational sales impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $7 billion to the Medical Devices forecast below our prior guidance. While there are many moving parts, the impact in Medical Device is the sole change to our prior operational sales guidance for the enterprise. So let's summarize this for you. Given all the factors I have described, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the following: adjusted operational sales of minus 3% to plus 0.5% incorporating the range of the Medical Device operational sales negative impact of approximately $4 billion to approximately $7 billion. Moving to operational sales, our guidance is $79.2 billion to $82.2 billion or minus 3.5% to 0%. As we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.09, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points versus the negative 50 basis points provided in our January guidance, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between minus 5.5% to minus 2.0% compared to 2019 or $77.5 billion to $80.5 billion. Moving to items impacting earnings, regarding adjusted pretax operating margin, we now expect adjusted pretax operating margin for the year to decline about a 100 basis points due to higher manufacturing costs related to COVID-19 sales impact, which is partially offset by spending reductions of approximately $2 billion. Net interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $150 million of expense due to lower rates on interest income earned. We are lowering our expectations for net other income. As mentioned earlier, our financial strength may present us with near term opportunities to execute transactions that enhance our current or future portfolio. There is another element to that strength. We are not dependent on selling assets to achieve our long-term objectives. Given the current market conditions and to ensure we create appropriate returns, we are assuming previously planned divestitures will be deferred until such time we can secure commensurate value for these very solid businesses. This decision results in us reducing our previously guided other income by $700 million to a range of $800 million to $1 billion. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 is now estimated to be approximately 16.5% to 18.0% wider than the previous range given the variability associated with the sequence and pace of economic recovery across the major regions. Given those updates, we are now comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.65 to $8.05 on a constant currency basis. This reflects an operational or constant currency decline of 11.9% to 7.3%. Again, while not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS, using exchange rates from last week, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share versus our prior guidance impact of negative $0.05. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.50 to $7.90, a range of minus 13.6% to minus 9.0% based on what we know today. A quick illustration of our EPS guidance change from January is presented here. The biggest impacts are obviously from the estimated decline in Medical Device sales and what we believe is a prudent decision to delay some previously planned divestitures. We also have some earnings impact associated with Johnson & Johnson's multifaceted leadership to combat COVID-19, from vaccine development, employee well-being and addressing healthcare worker needs, totaling close to a $0.25 billion. To help partially offset these items, we are reducing spend by approximately $2.3 billion on a pre-tax basis. But let me be clear, this is largely a reduction aligned to expenses that we believe will naturally be lower. We are not reducing important programs, initiatives or practices that best serve all stakeholders for the long-term. Our investors convey to us that they want us to continue managing for results 2, 5 and 10 years into the future. We do not provide quarterly guidance, but there are two items worth noting for you to consider as you update your models for Q2. The first is likely apparent. We expect the greatest COVID-19 impact on sales to occur in the second quarter. Second, for comparative purposes, recall that in the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a significant divestiture gain as other income. Today's revised guidance is a clear indication that a gain of that size will not occur in the second quarter of 2020. Before I hand the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A, let me thank many on the phone listening today. We appreciate the insights you have shared to enhance our thought process and while a 100% precision is not the order of the day, we hope you found the explanation of our guidance updates useful. I also want to thank our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for the extraordinary effort and dedication they have displayed these past few months. I am humbled by the magnificent leadership stories I hear on a daily basis. They serve as an inspiration. Our performance in the first quarter highlights the resiliency of our business during challenging times and showcases the commitment of our employees to advance solutions that enhance the lives of patients and consumers seeking better health. Chris, back to you to begin the Q&A portion. Great. Sure, David. Thanks for the questions. I would say you could probably expect that in our consumer unit, you saw significant stocking across the globe probably as Chris referenced was about 7 points of additional growth for the consumer franchise. We were off to a good start, but then you saw the benefit of pantry loading. I would say in pharm remains to be seen. As you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. It was only worth about 1 point of growth in the quarter as some PBMs moved from 30-day refill cycles to 90 days. I would imagine that activity will still continue, but we have to see how that plays out a little bit further into the second quarter here when you have stay-at-home protocols. Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. As you might imagine, while we hope 2021 looks a lot like we thought it was going to look like maybe 3 months ago. We really have to let that play out. We did see and put into our modeling anywhere from normal level of procedures in the fourth quarter to a recoupment if you will of plus 15%. But it's really going to depend on the pandemic itself what's the health priorities, how are patients and consumers feeling about going to the hospital for these procedures. So I believe from what we have heard from hospital CEOs that they would like to get back into business of elective surgeries. Many of you saw recent announcements, Mayo Clinic most recently with respect to just only 25% utilization in their elective suites. That is putting financial strain on major hospital systems and we want to make sure that when we return to normal that there is good quality healthcare still in place. So I will defer I think it would be a little bit irresponsible for me at this point in time to comment on 2021. The hope and the optimism is for whenever the pandemic abates, we will be at or above expectations that we have all once had. Go ahead, Paul. Why don't you go? Yes, I would think it really dovetails to what Alex outlined there in terms of returning to work, opening up the economy. We're going to look for those same telltale signs, how safe is the environment at large with respect to people's comfort level to going back, being in social settings, going to hospitals to get procedures that they would \u2013 might otherwise defer during a time like this. So we'll continue to watch those on each weekly basis and the volume that comes through our major markets. Thanks for the questions, Louise. So with respect to what's in the $2.3 billion that I referenced in my prepared remarks. Those are expenses that we expect to naturally fall out as a result of the social distancing or stay-at-home measures, the work-from-home measures that have been instituted across the globe. So think of those in categories such as travel, company meetings. There will be some project delays naturally when people aren't on site to execute them. I want to be very clear though, we are not rushing to judgment and cutting valuable scientific programs, valuable initiatives within our commercial capabilities or programs that benefit our employees to manage our P&L in the short term. As you heard me say, we think we are very well-positioned for the long term. You heard from Paul, Alex and Joaquin that our clinical trials for our major submissions this year continue to be on track. We are not looking to disrupt this. So we talk to investors regularly. They want us managing for two, five, 10 years out with a long term perspective. And so that's what we're living into. We think that's appropriate given with the guidance we provided today and should the need arise, we will look to of course correct as appropriate. With respect to our cash flow, clearly, we will have a little bit of a hit to our original projections. But as a reminder, we are a strong generator of cash flow. Last year, we had an all-time high of about $20 billion in cash flow. We were still up very well into the teens this year in all of our projections. We will see how it plays out relative to this guidance. But we are very well-positioned with $18 billion of cash and access to credit markets, should we need them on a short term basis. But we feel very comfortable with the position, not just for getting through 2020, but then being very strong into 2021."

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJessica Moore: Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and our financial outlook for 2022. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments and additionally, full year 2021 results for the enterprise. Joe will provide some additional business commentary, insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment and our guidance for 2022. Joaquin will close the call by sharing his perspective on the healthcare environment and his strategic priorities as the new CEO of Johnson & Johnson. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. Now to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $24.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 11.6% as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales growth was 18.5%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 21.2%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.3% worldwide, 3.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included additional shipping days, which negatively impacted 2021 fourth quarter growth by approximately 400 basis points and full year growth by about 100 basis points. These impacts can be roughly applied across all segments, but were more heavily skewed to the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.77 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.65 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.13, representing increases of 14.4% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.2%. For the full year 2021, consolidated sales were $93.8 billion an increase of 13.6% compared to the full year of 2020. Operationally, full year sales grew 12.2%, with currency having a positive impact of 1.4 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 9.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales growth was 18.2%. Operational sales outside the U.S. grew by 15.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.8% worldwide, 9.5% in the U.S. and 16.6% outside the U.S. Net earnings for the full year 2021 were $20.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $7.81 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.51 a year ago. 2021 adjusted net earnings were $26.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.80, representing increases of 22.2% and 22%, respectively, versus full year 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 20.2%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2021 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and grew 1.8%, with growth in the U.S. of 1.3% and 2.1% outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by the 2020 additional shipping days worth approximately 400 basis points, which can be roughly applied to all franchises as well as industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to raw material availability and labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business worth approximately 360 basis points. Adjusting for these items, solid results were primarily driven by above-market growth in OTC. E-commerce continues to have strong double-digit growth. Finally, when comparing to 2019, Consumer Health grew approximately 4% in the quarter. When adjusting for acquisition and divestitures, sales growth was closer to 5%. Over-the-counter medicines globally grew 15.8% due to increased incidents in U.S. adult and pediatric fever and worldwide category recovery in cough, cold and flu and digestive health. The U.S. also saw share gains primarily in TYLENOL and MOTRIN. Strength was seen across multiple areas in the portfolio, including analgesics, upper respiratory, digestive health, naturals and anti-smoking aids. The Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined 7.1%, driven by external supply constraints, primarily in NEUTROGENA and OGX and divestitures worth approximately 230 basis points, primarily due to Sedona, the salon-based portion of Dr. Ci Labo in Asia Pacific. Declines were partially offset by market recovery and e-commerce strength. Oral Care declined globally 6.5% as compared to strong double-digit growth in the prior year, driven by the floss divestiture worth approximately 170 basis points and category declines in EMEA. Declines were partially offset by successful brand building and promotional campaigns in Asia Pacific. The Baby Care franchise declined 0.8% with U.S. declines of 7.5% and growth of 1.3% outside the U.S. Declines were driven by prior year retailer stocking and external supply constraints in the U.S., partially offset by e-commerce growth of AVEENO Baby and Asia Pacific. Wound Care declined 6.4%, primarily due to the divestiture of the professional tape business worth approximately 150 basis points, partially offset by strong performance of Band-Aid brand and adhesive bandages in the U.S. Women's Health grew 1.3%, driven by market recovery in Latin America. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $14.3 billion grew 17.9%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 4.2% and OUS sales increasing by 36.9%. Worldwide sales included a $1.6 billion contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide growth was 18.6%. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver the tenth consecutive full year of worldwide above-market adjusted operational growth. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 7.1% driven by strong performance of TREMFYA and STELARA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. TREMFYA was up 82.8% worldwide, with continued share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased nearly 3 points in both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications. STELARA grew 5.1% worldwide driven by strong share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with increases of roughly 4 points and roughly 6 points, respectively, in the U.S. Current quarter growth was impacted by a negative prior period rebate adjustment and reserve adjustment recorded in Q4 2021 in the U.S. worth approximately 700 basis points on worldwide growth for the quarter versus the prior year. Our Oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 12.3%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 33.4% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and continued launches globally. DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 8 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA grew 61.3% worldwide, driven by strong share uptake, increased market penetration in the U.S. and new launches outside of the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintained its market leadership position, however, declined 3.1% worldwide due to competitive pressures from novel oral agents. U.S. decline was partially offset by growth in all regions outside of the U.S. Neuroscience grew 7.1% worldwide driven by the paliperidone long-acting portfolio posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts, strong persistency globally and the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA in the quarter. The cardiovascular, metabolism and other business declined 13.8% worldwide due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our pulmonary hypertension portfolio was roughly flat, driven by COVID-19 market constraints and generic entrants and other pulmonary hypertension, offset by U.S. share uptake in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.9 billion, growing 5.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales grew 5.6% worldwide. The medical devices market continued to be impacted by COVID-19, with the Omicron variant contributing to a softening of recovery trends in medical and surgical procedures, especially late in the quarter. Consistent with prior COVID-19 surges, impacts were more acute in areas deemed to be more deferrable in nature, including spine and knees. Comparing to 2019, Medical Devices grew about 4% on an adjusted operational basis. On a full year basis, Medical Devices growth versus 2019 was just over 4.5%, building on the pre-COVID growth momentum. Interventional Solutions continued to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 15.3% driven by market recovery, successful penetration of new products and commercial execution across both electrophysiology and CERENOVUS. Advanced Surgery grew 7.6% worldwide, driven by market recovery; expansion into Tier 2 and 3 hospitals in China; and performance of newer products such as ENSEAL X1 in Energy, ECHELON+ in endocutters and SURGICEL powder in biosurgery. MONARCH system orders in the fourth quarter marked the highest number of orders in any quarter since launch. And more importantly, as a positive indicator of MONARCH technology adoption and patient treatment regimens, we continue to see strong growth in the number of MONARCH-enabled bronchoscopy procedures with total procedures since launch exceeding 12,000. In fact, 2021 MONARCH procedures more than doubled those performed in the prior year. General Surgery grew 1.7% worldwide, led by wound closure, primarily due to market recovery, coupled with innovation penetration. Inventory dynamics in the prior year negatively impacted wound closure U.S. results by about 350 basis points and positively impacted results outside the U.S. by about 250 basis points. Worldwide orthopedics declined 0.7% versus prior year, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on procedures. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 2.0%, driven by continued market stabilization and the success of recently launched products, partially offset by competitive pressures in China. The positive impact on growth from prior year inventory contractions in China was primarily offset by the additional shipping days in 2020. Worldwide hips grew 2.7%, driven by continued strength from our portfolio, including the ACTIS stem and technologies such as VELYS hip navigation, sustaining our leadership in the anterior approach. Growth in the outpatient surgery channel in the U.S. and market recovery outside the U.S. were additional contributors to growth. Worldwide knees was relatively flat with a decline of 4.2% in the U.S. and growth of 6.5% outside the U.S. The U.S. market was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and healthcare resource constraints on procedures. These impacts were partially offset by strong growth in the outpatient channel and positive momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Growth outside the U.S. was driven by market recovery and success of products such as ATTUNE Revision. Lastly, in Orthopedics, worldwide spine declined 9.4%, primarily driven by a deceleration in procedure volumes related to COVID-19 and health system resource constraints. Partially offsetting this decline are the positive impacts from the continued success of new products such as X-Pac, CONDUIT and SYMPHONY and prior year inventory reductions in China contributing approximately 360 basis points to worldwide growth. Worldwide Vision grew 11%. Contact lens and other grew 7.1% worldwide. U.S. growth of 9.4% was driven by successful commercial campaigns and adoption of recently launched ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL for presbyopia. U.S. growth was impacted by inventory fluctuations in both the current and prior year worth about 550 basis points. Growth outside the U.S. of 5.8% was driven by market recovery, coupled with strength of new product launches such as ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical Vision grew 22.1% globally, with both the U.S. and OUS businesses growing double-digits. These positive results were driven by market recovery and share gains from recent differentiated product launches across all Surgical Vision product lines, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy in our ocular lenses used in cataract surgery. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021, I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. As reported earlier, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 reflects a reported increase of 14.5% and an operational increase of 17.2%. Cost of products sold leveraged by 270 basis points, primarily driven by favorable mix within the pharmaceutical business; a reduction in prior year COVID-19 related costs in the Medical Devices business; and favorable mix within the enterprise, with a larger portion of sales from the pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins remained relatively flat, driven by increased brand marketing expense in the Consumer Health business, mostly offset by expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 19% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 by 110 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business and higher investment in the Medical Devices business. The other income and expense line is a net expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of $2.4 billion last year. This was driven by lower litigation expenses. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 2.1% compared to a benefit of 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the prior year tax benefit associated with litigation expenses, partially offset by one-time tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.4% versus 11.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2021 10-K for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 24.9% to 25.6%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 recovery. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment: Medical Devices improved by 160 basis points, driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts; Consumer Health margins declined by 460 basis points, primarily driven by increased brand marketing expenses and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. The improvement in Pharmaceutical margins of 110 basis points was primarily driven by favorable product mix and selling, marketing and administration leverage. This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. As reported today, our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $9.80 reflects a reported increase of 22% and an operational increase of 20.2%. The growth is primarily related to COVID-19 recovery realized predominantly in our Medical Devices business. Lastly, I direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2021 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved by 170 basis points versus 2020. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices improved by 870 basis points to 25.7%, primarily driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts. Pharmaceutical margins declined by 150 basis points to 40.5%, primarily driven by R&D portfolio progression. Consumer Health margins were flat at 23.8%, driven by increased brand marketing expense and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $2.6 billion or 21% on a full year basis. In the quarter, we received approval by the European Commission for the long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy BYANNLI for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. This approval makes BYANNLI the first twice-yearly treatment for adults living with schizophrenia, providing the longest available dosing interval for an antipsychotic medication to be approved in Europe. Additionally, RYBREVANT received conditional marketing authorization in EMEA. RYBREVANT, a bispecific therapy targeting both EGFR and cMet, is the first treatment approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy. Finally, we submitted a Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of teclistamab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and as aligned with our strategy to expand treatment options for multiple myeloma patients. Teclistamab is an investigational off-the-shelf T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody targeting both BCMA and CD3. Consistent with our disciplined approach to portfolio prioritization, we are discontinuing the SELECT Phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of selexipag as an add-on to the standard of care therapy in patients with inoperable CTEPH, as the study did not meet its primary end point. Medical Devices announced a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to further develop a secure and compliant digital ecosystem with a goal of connecting devices across the entire portfolio. This collaboration will help enhance the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to generate insights leading to smarter, less invasive and more personalized solutions across the entire patient care continuum. This concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2021. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\nJoseph Wolk: Thank you, Jess, and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our outlook for 2022. We continue to manage the implications of COVID-19 globally, but it is encouraging to see the resilience of our business, driven by the dedication of countless healthcare professionals and the 136,000 Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Their collective commitment and focus on providing healthcare solutions enabled us to deliver another year of strong financial performance. Our Pharmaceuticals segment delivered a tenth consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth. Medical Devices continued to manage through the ongoing impact of COVID-19 to experience a partial recovery, and Consumer Health grew competitively while navigating industry-wide supply constraints. All of this culminated in Johnson & Johnson posting adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 22% for the year, while also investing in our business for the future. We are well positioned as we head into 2022. Before we recap our year-end cash position and guidance for 2022, I'd like to touch on the announcement we made in the fourth quarter regarding our intent to separate our Consumer Health business to create 2 market-leading companies. As independent companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health company will each be better positioned to exercise more focused strategic and capital decisions. We intend for each company to possess compelling financial profiles that reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business, enabling each company to be in a position to enhance the strong results that you've come to expect. As far as where we stand in the process, we have established a very strong, largely separate team focused on advancing the separation. And the financial and operational work streams are well underway. As conveyed in November, the Board of Directors' intent is for the planned separation to occur through the capital markets, and there are multiple capital market separation pathways being considered. Depending on the pathway, there are different SEC requirements that must be adhered to. In order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways, we cannot, at this time, disclose specific Consumer Health financial information not previously disclosed or that which is associated with the separation. As such, you can expect that Consumer Health as well as the rest of our business will be reported as it has been reported previously for the entirety of 2022. We can, however, provide a high-level time line for some nonfinancial items, which may be of interest. In the first half of 2022, we anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health company, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with our previous communications we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment, working within the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Let's now discuss our 2021 year-end cash position and future capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of nearly $20 billion. At the end of 2021, we had approximately $32 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt for a net debt position of $2 billion. We are pleased that 2021 was another record year in terms of R&D investment at $14.7 billion, a 21% increase over our previous all-time high recorded in 2020. We recognize that investment in innovation is critical to our future growth profile and remains a top priority from a capital allocation standpoint. Given that we are at our lowest levels of net debt in almost 5 years, progressing towards a net cash position, we anticipate leaning in on some of our other capital allocation priorities beyond internal R&D. This includes building upon the 59 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. It also includes, as Joaquin has mentioned in recent forums, utilizing our cash to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps and play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. We will assess opportunities of all sizes. However, our preferred option is tuck-in deals, which typically offer greater value creation. It is also important to note that should we find the right opportunities, the Consumer Health separation work stream will not prevent us from forging ahead. And finally, with respect to capital allocation, modest share repurchases may be evaluated as part of our capital deployment actions. Let me provide a few comments regarding our guidance for full year 2022, which encompasses expectations for our 3 business segments. In our Pharmaceuticals business, we will continue to drive innovation and market-leading sales growth with continued expansion of existing brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and the recently launched RYBREVANT for lung cancer. We are particularly excited about the anticipated FDA approval for [CARVIC-T], our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We believe this medicine is best-in-class, showing unprecedented results in clinical trials. In our Medical Devices business, we expect COVID-19 and hospital staffing to continue to be a dynamic variable, likely more impactful in the first half of 2022 as we cycle through Omicron. Our 2022 guidance assumes continued medical devices market recovery, but it also assumes, as you have heard us say previously, enhanced competitiveness. Almost all of our priority platforms are holding or gaining share based on third quarter 2021 year-to-date information, illustrating the positive business momentum versus 2019 when only about 50% of our platforms were holding or gaining share. This improved market performance enables us to maximize the value of recently launched products. In Consumer Health, we are confident that our well-balanced portfolio positions us well. Consistent with current global macroeconomic trends, we are experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures, including higher input costs across our business and more significantly with respect to Consumer Health. These external challenges include availability and cost of certain commodities, labor and transportation. Similar to competitors, we are instituting price increases across our Consumer Health portfolio in 2022, enabling us to remain competitive as we continue to deliver the products that consumers love and trust. So with that backdrop, let's get into the details for the full year 2022 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. Starting with sales, we expect operational sales growth for the full year 2022 between 7.0% and 8.5%. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures to be negligible, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting the same range as adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.0% to 8.5% or $100.3 billion to $101.8 billion. Our 2022 sales guidance includes approximately $3 billion from our COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of this volume is outside of the U.S. for low and middle-income countries corresponding to previously signed advanced purchase agreements. As you know, we do not predict currency movement. But for context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.14, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 5.5% and 7.0% or 6.2% at the midpoint compared to 2021, representing a range of $98.9 billion to $100.4 billion for 2022. As done in the past, I will provide a few qualitative comments related to quarterly phasing. Starting with Consumer Health, the supply constraints that were mentioned as part of Jess' commentary for the quarter will continue into 2022. We estimate that the majority of that impact will be experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in the first quarter and primarily in Skin Health, Beauty. We, therefore, expect second half performance to outperform the first half. In Medical Devices, we expect some COVID-19 headwinds and hospital staffing shortages to continue into 2022, but anticipate market recovery as global health systems treat new patients and work through procedure backlogs. Given this, we expect market recovery to improve as the year progresses and greater contribution from the new products launched in 2021 for an overall better second half. Finally, in Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate our market-leading performance will be fairly stable throughout the year, with perhaps some modest adjustments for timing of events associated with alliance revenue or tenders. We are monitoring report surface by large insurers that recent office visits are slightly down in both primary care and specialists. I'll continue to go through the items on our P&L, starting with operating margin. We expect 2022 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage, partially offset by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs, as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and write-offs. We expect this to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2022, consistent with 2021 levels.  Finally, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $0 million and $100 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2022 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current assumptions for geographic mix and certain international tax legislation changes for research and development expenses in 2022. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.2% to 10.2% or 9.2% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.40 to $10.60 or $10.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 7.1% versus the prior year. We expect the company's COVID-19 vaccine to contribute approximately an incremental $0.20 to earnings per share in 2022. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'm now thrilled to welcome Joaquin Duato to his first earnings call as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin, as a colleague who has worked alongside you for the past several years, it's clear that healthcare and providing good health for everyone, everywhere is not just your business, but a passion. I am excited to welcome you in your new capacity and look forward to continuing to partner with you, the Executive Committee and our colleagues across the globe in our mission to change the trajectory of health for humanity.  Over to you, Joaquin.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you all for my first earnings announcement as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. We appreciate everyone tuning in today, and thank you for your interest in our company. Despite continued and evolving impact from COVID-19 globally, Johnson & Johnson delivered another strong year of sales and earnings growth. Full year Johnson & Johnson adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% reflects the tenth consecutive year of adjusted operational above-market growth from Pharmaceuticals, the ongoing positive growth momentum from Medical Devices and continued competitive growth in Consumer Health. These strong results contribute to my confidence in our ability to achieve 2022 operational sales and earnings per share growth in the high single digits, with EPS growth that is higher than sales despite macroeconomic factors such as inflation. This, coupled with our differentiated portfolio of pipeline innovation, further strengthens my confidence in our long-term growth potential. In recent months, I have been busy meeting and listening to our customers, partners and members of the Johnson & Johnson family around the world. As part of these conversations, I have thought about the underlying constant of our business, the secret ingredient to our success. It is our people, their dedication and their eagerness to ask the toughest questions and seek the boldest and bravest answers. I'm deeply optimistic about our future, and I feel energized about the potential for our business. In the last 2 years, COVID-19 has changed global perceptions and attitudes towards healthcare. It has shown us that there is significant opportunity for change and improvement in order to better serve patients, customers and communities around the world. The global response to the pandemic has also created a renewed sense of optimism about the power of science. Around the world, people are focused on personal and societal health in new and urgent ways. And importantly, people are demanding that companies deliver on their promises and act with purpose. Johnson & Johnson will continue to answer that call. We strongly believe the future ahead of us looks brighter and healthier for every patient and consumer. We are determined to achieve this future, grounded by the same mission and credo that always guided us. In 2022, we will run our business as we always have, with these segments, maximizing opportunities for each individually. And I would like to share a bit about our near-term priorities as we focus on successfully creating a new independent Consumer Health company as well as continuing to build on our individual global leadership in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices while enhancing synergies, which uniquely position us to accelerate growth and bring differentiated therapies that span both segments. At the end of last year, I laid out my top 3 priorities for a new era for Johnson & Johnson, and those priorities remain unchanged. These priorities are equally important for our success and include driving Medical Devices to become a best-in-class performer. We continue to focus on improved execution as evidenced by market share momentum as well as our improved cadence of innovation and organic and inorganic expansion into higher growth markets and market segments. We have 11 platforms in Medical Devices, which are over $1 billion. And as we have shared previously, we are gaining or holding share in almost all of this. This includes building upon our global market-leading positions in areas like electrophysiology, biosurgery and contact lenses and gaining market share in areas where we have been more challenged like Surgical Vision. The team has also launched over 20 new products during 2021, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in orthopedics and 2 new intraocular lenses in Surgical Vision. Next, delivering on our Pharmaceutical business commitments and long-term growth goals. We are continuing to build upon our promising pharmaceutical pipeline, which we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth rates and are focused on our previously announced long-term goal of growing to a $60 billion segment by 2025. We are continuing to maximize the value of our existing medicines with 13 marketed medicines across 6 therapeutic areas, each to exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2025. We expect to file 36 significant line expansions for these 13 products through 2025. Here, it is important to note that these expansions are largely derisked because the products are in the market today, so there is good insight into their overall profiles. In addition, we expect 14 novel therapy filings through 2025, each with the potential to exceed $1 billion in revenue and 5 of this with the ability to exceed $5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the potential patent expiries as we have done in the past and continue to grow at above market rates. And finally, ensuring the successful creation of the new Consumer Health company.  In the coming year, we will take the steps necessary to be in a position to separate our Consumer Health business from our Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device businesses during 2023. This will advance more targeted business strategies, accelerate growth and deliver improved outcomes for both patients and consumers, which ultimately will deliver greater value to shareholders. Our Consumer Health business is competitive in terms of growth and over the past few years has made significant progress improving the margin profile. And as we advance towards a successful new stand-alone Consumer Health company, we will continue to drive this business with the same focus we always have. Our best-in-class team is delivering science-backed innovation across OTC, Skin Health and our Specialty business with a focus on digital, consumer-centric solutions and seamless end-to-end customer experience. As Joe noted, we continue to believe that a fit-for-purpose corporate structure and a dedicated capital allocation strategy will provide the Consumer Health business with the agility and flexibility to continue to grow its iconic portfolio of brands and innovate new products in the fast-paced consumer market. And we expect this new and independent company, with nearly $15 billion in 2021 sales, will continue to be a global leader in the consumer health industry. And the new Johnson & Johnson at nearly $80 billion in sales in 2021 will continue to be the largest, most diversified healthcare company in the world and will retain the benefits of scale. We'll enhance our ability to be more focused with our operations, making the new Johnson & Johnson poised to bring integrated and comprehensive care to patients through the use of new technology and innovative science. As we continue to focus on our 3 sectors today, we have no intention of sitting on the sidelines. Our strong financial position, along with the clear priorities we have for our business, position us well to deliver near-term financial expectations and invest for the long-term value creation. We'll have the flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and maintain our track record of growing our dividend while aspiring to be bolder with strategic value-creating acquisitions that will enhance the new Johnson & Johnson in higher growth markets. At this critical time for healthcare and our global society, we understand the significant role we play, and we accept the responsibility and challenges of the future. I hope you will all join us as we step forward into this new era. Thank you. And with that, let me turn it back to Jess to open the Q&A.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Jan. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So I wanted to ask you about M&A. Do you think certain M&A targets look more interesting to you given the significant pullback in biotech valuations? Or do you still think some of these good assets are overvalued? And do you think companies and boards of mid-cap biotechs have capitulated to valuation resets? Or will that take more time?\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. Thank you for the question. As we commented, our strong financial performance in 2021 is enveloped in a very strong financial profile, giving us the latitude to manage both for the long-term while meeting the short-term expectations of the financial community. As Joe commented, too, we are about to turn from a net debt to a net cash position for the first time in over 4 years. So we'll have to -- we'll have the flexibility to continue to grow our dividend, be bolder in strategic acquisitions and enhance the new J&J position in higher growth markets. And if warranted, we also would consider share repurchase programs. I believe that these priorities position us well for the future. And I think it's important to consider that when we get into 2022, we'll continue to manage the business strategically, one. The separation and the creation of the new consumer company, it's not going to slow us down of any priorities. So we continue to think about how we are going to opportunistically deploy cash for both organic and inorganic initiatives. And in other words, I wanted to make clear that if the right opportunities are there, in medtech and pharmaceuticals, the work stream of the separation won't held us back from forging ahead. When it comes to Pharmaceuticals, as you mentioned, we presented our outlook for the business in our November R&D review. And we explained to you that we were anticipating -- we are anticipating above-market growth rates reaching $60 billion by 2025, growing every single year there. So when we think about those results, it's important to remember that we do not factor there any future acquisitions or collaborations and that we are confident to reach those goals without inorganic activity. That said, one of the pillars of our success has been our agnostic view related to innovation and our desire to lean in for the new Johnson & Johnson for opportunities to build our current portfolio and our current portfolio, both in pharma and medtech remains there, and we need to look for that to enhance our growth profile. In fact, over the past 5 years, our investments in organic R&D and externally sourced innovation have been about equal. We continue to look to opportunities to be able to enhance our pharmaceutical portfolio. And we have been very proficient in identifying opportunities that have a high probability of success very early on as we have done, for example, with Legend. And also, we have been good looking at the post proof-of-concept opportunities like we did with Momenta. In the future, we'll continue to look for all types of opportunities early on post proof-of-concept. And we also will look at other opportunities of large size that we'll have to fulfill higher from a financial perspective, given the higher operational complications that these opportunities may take. But yes, we are constantly looking at M&A as a key source of growth for our business. Our position in cash today makes us been more aggressive in that area, and we'll continue with our focus on taking acquisitions, but not excluding, if the situation is granted, to look at medium-sized also opportunities.\nJoseph Wolk: Yes, Louis, thanks for the question. This is Joe. I would just say, maybe to further elaborate on Joaquin's points, With respect to your question on valuations, it's really hard to say whether there's been a capitulation or a recognition that values have come down. I think we probably need to see a little bit longer period of that. I don't think things are out there necessarily on sale. But I will say that it really just takes 2 parties to agree on a valuation that makes sense. And a lot of times, the valuation is driven by the capabilities, the skills, the scientific expertise that we have that maybe that potential partner or acquired asset does not have at that time. So that's the kind of the way we look at it. Again, I don't think there's a capitulation, but we are seeking to use some of the cash on the balance sheet in a very disciplined, responsible way, that compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf where we can create great value.\nJessica Moore: Next question, Rob?\nOperator: Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Joe or Joaquin, can you help us think about device growth in Q1? How has January '22 trended relative to January 2021? And how are you thinking about medtech market growth in 2022? Previously, I think you expected about 4% to 5% growth. Is that still the case with Omicron and J&J's growth relative to that? How are you thinking about that?\nJoseph Wolk: Yes, Larry, thanks for the question and your interest. I would say it's somewhat a tale of 2 cities. If you look at surgical procedure volume in the fourth quarter, it eroded over the months of October, November, December. I would say it was roughly flat in the early part of the quarter relative to 2019, which we think is a more appropriate comparison, to down about 5%. The most pronounced area was clearly Orthopedics, which is the most elective segment of our portfolio. However, there's probably some reason for optimism if you look at diagnostic volumes in the fourth quarter. So that average roughly, let's call it 7%. It was a little bit stronger in October than it was in December, but still very positive relative to levels that were experienced in 2019. So we think there is a backlog that is potentially building of diagnosed cases that have yet to be scheduled. That being said, as you've heard from a number of outlets at this point, it really is about the hospital staffing and being able to accommodate surgeries from that perspective. We are seeing reduced cases with respect to Omicron, and we think that will play favorably. The first couple of weeks in January and probably limiting this to a week, maybe 2, saw a little bit of a bleed over from what we experienced in December around surgical procedures. But I do think that's going to improve with each passing month and with each passing quarter as the year goes on. And then as you heard from Joaquin as well as Jess, we are favorably positioned to capitalize on a much more stable market, given our improved competitiveness from where we were just a few years ago, in addition to the enhanced pipeline. Last year, we introduced over 20 products, same expectation for this year as well. So once the market gets to be a little bit more stable, hopefully no more future variants, and hospital administrators who have done a great job through the pandemic continue to modify their plans to ensure appropriate staffing, we think we will be in a very good position to not only approach market growth, but hopefully exceed it.\nJoaquin Duato: Yes, I would continue building up on Joe's comment that as the Omicron surge resolves, we anticipate that the markets will continue to improve as the year progresses. It is very difficult to predict when Omicron is going to peak, but we are beginning already to see cases decreasing in areas where the surge began like, for example, in the UK, and some regions in the U.S. already nearing peaks. So while COVID-19 may temporarily delay necessary medical and surgical interventions, the vast majority of these procedures cannot be ignored completely. And at the same time, hospitals, as Joe was referring, are getting better dealing with these situations. So while the path is not going to be linear, we expect an improvement as the year starts to go on and the fundamentals of the medtech market remain intact with disease prevalence and the need for surgery and change. So we believe we are optimistic of the value of the market in the long term, and we are optimistic about our medtech business and its ongoing recovery and improvement in the overall competitive position. So when we are facing 2022 on the medtech side, both from a market perspective and also from a Johnson & Johnson perspective, we look at it optimistically. And we think that the situation will clearly improve as Omicron surge resolves and the year progresses.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Larry. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Joaquin, some of your recent public commentary implies -- or not implies, but you relayed that you'll have a focus on Medical Device unit success. I wondered if you could just kind of bracket, yes, I guess, your goals? Is it could sustain mid-single-digit organic revenue growth trajectory for the unit or potentially accelerate towards 6 or even north of 6? And what would you consider success as we look out on a multiyear horizon? And then just in terms of your priorities for investment or your team along with Ashley's for the Medical Device unit, are you going to prioritize investments in areas where there's a higher weighted average market growth rate? Or would you be balanced in thinking about a unit like spine? That's been an anchor unit. I mean, would you -- are you going to balance your investments both internally and externally to a lower performer and the competitiveness despite kind of a low single-digit market growth rate? Or will the focus be on adding assets and investing in businesses that have that higher growth rate?\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Joe. So overall, as I have commented in our Pharmaceutical Analyst Day and also in the different conferences that I have participated, medtech, it's going to be a key priority for me in my tenure. I see medtech and pharmaceuticals being the core of the new Johnson & Johnson that, as Joe commented, will remain the largest and more diversified healthcare company. So clearly, medtech, it's going to be a key area of focus for us in every aspect. When it comes to medtech and its market performance, I have to highlight that we have seen a very clear ongoing recovery in our medtech performance. We went from 1.5% growth in 2017 to nearly 4% in 2019, and we are ending the year at 4.6%. And when you adjust for the 53rd week, we are in about 5%. So we are clearly improving our performance in the medtech space, driven by some market segments which are really delivering in a very strong way. For example, in interventional, our growth ending the year was 15.3%. Our ambition, our growth in the year was 11%. So we have clearly outstanding performance there. And in most of the platforms that we participate, we are gaining share or maintaining share, improving our position. It's difficult for me to bracket exactly what the growth is going to be and when it's going to happen. But our goal clearly is to make our medtech sector a best-in-class performer. So that's going to be a defining element of my tenure, and we are going to be working towards that. We are going to be improving our commercial execution as we are doing today. We'll continue to invest in our organic pipeline that is delivering. We have had the highest level of innovation in our medtech business in 2021 ever, and our pipeline today has the highest value as measured by net present value that we have ever had. And also, we recognize that we need to do and we need to continue to be active in external innovation in order to be able to participate in markets where growth is occurring that we are not participating today or to build upon adjacencies our existing businesses that are going to further our growth. So as in any business, when it comes to their business allocation, we'll continue to drive our winners, and we'll try to efficiently manage the areas in which we are more challenged. And we'll continue to look for opportunities externally that will complement our portfolio and will enable us to enter into higher growth markets. Overall, our past acquisitions suggest that we have been good in managing smaller deals and tacking deals, and that is our base case. But at the same time, we don't have an artificial ceiling in our deal size. We are always looking for any opportunity that exist in the marketplace. But as I said before, when I was commenting about pharmaceuticals, we do know that larger deals are much harder to make work, both financially and operationally, and they will always have a higher bar. So very important for us and for the new Johnson & Johnson, the focus in our medtech business and how much we are going to prioritize this area of our business.\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Josh. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: Just 2 quick ones here. First, on operating margin leverage, you're talking about 50 basis points in '22. But as I think about longer term, I think about J&J, they got a broad pipeline of assets to invest in. Can we think about the company continuing to leverage its P&L over the next few years, I guess, particularly as you head into the STELARA LOE? Or should we think about a window of time longer term where some of the top line growth is maybe reinvested back in the business and margin expansion kind of is a bit more muted for a few years? And then, Joaquin, just following up on the M&A and Medical Devices. I just want to make sure I'm clear. As we think about business development and the role it's going to play within that division, should we be thinking about something very different than in the past? Or is it more about a tweak in the approach and the strategy from what you've been seeing recently? So is this a lot more deals, if they're smaller or something bigger? Or again, is it just kind of accelerating maybe a bit from what you've been doing in the last few years?\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. With respect to operating margins, I think the 50 basis points is probably something that is reasonable to expect this year given some of the inflationary pressures that we've outlined, likely to be experienced in the first half of this year. That being said, given the size of our company, we do think we can always improve kind of the infrastructure, our operating model to find some leverage in the P&L. I won't commit to any -- to say it's each and every year. I think that's going to be very much dependent upon the opportunities that are presented to us in any given year. And if we've got an opportunity to invest disproportionately in R&D, on a particular asset, we will do that, and we just have to size up that opportunity. But I do think as a general rule, given the size of our company, that we should find some opportunity to operate where we can leverage. I would like to see us as we separate the company, maybe be relabeled as more of a growth company. And therefore, we may reposition that, taking that top line growth and putting that back into the business. But as you can see, even in recent years, we've had, I would say, significant operating margin improvement, but we have not starved investment. R&D was up over last year's record-setting year by $2.6 billion or 20%, as Jess mentioned. So we feel that we're finding that right balance, and we'll continue to do so moving forward.\nJoaquin Duato: And when it comes to your question, Chris, about M&A in the medtech business. Our aspiration in medtech is to be the first or the second in the markets that we participate. And if we are in markets that -- if we are not in markets that are growing, also have a path to get there, right? Recently, we have divested some of the businesses like diagnostics, pain, diabetes, where we came to the conclusion that it was difficult to get into this #1, #2 position, and that was better to sell that business in order to create value. So given the recent investment activity, what I want to emphasize and I have alluded at the outset is that my priority now is to be more on the acquisitive side and to be more aggressive on the acquisition side, identifying products that complement our portfolio but play in higher growth markets or market segments that we are today. So that's the change in outlook that you are noticing.\nJoseph Wolk: And Chris, my job will be to keep him disciplined, right? But he's going to conduct that anyway.\nJessica Moore: Wonderful. Thank you, Chris. Next question, Rob?\nOperator: Next question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: There are a lot of factors that go into -- I'm thinking about 2022. Obviously, COVID, staffing shortages, foreign exchange, freight, inflation and in certain areas, external supply. When you put together your guidance, how did you weight all these? And is there a lower-end, higher-end range? How do we think about all of these different factors as we think about the start of the year?\nJoseph Wolk: It's a great question, Joanne, and thank you for it. It's -- and it certainly has been a moving target as we had certain thoughts as '22 would shape up in the beginning of December to where we are actually ending up today. We've tried to address all the risks that are appropriate based on the information that we have as of January 26. And so we've taken into account, I think, a favorable outlook and an improving trend in Medical Devices, but also the fact that it's going to be a slower start to the year for some of the factors that we mentioned. The same type of position was taken with consumer and some of the supply constraints from some of our suppliers. So I think it's the right balance for where we stand today. We know from the last 2 years that things will likely change, and we'll adjust accordingly. In Pharmaceuticals, there's really not much of a change there. We expect that to be pretty stable. We enjoyed our 10th consecutive year of above-market growth, and we're planning for an 11th year in 2022. We did take note of some of the larger insurers who commented last week during their earnings calls about reduced office visits. So we'll continue to monitor that. But given the portfolio in Pharmaceuticals and various severe diseases that we address with our products, we don't see much change there.\nJoaquin Duato: I would add to that, that just we take into consideration some of the headwinds related to pandemic and also macroeconomic headwinds like inflation, and that's something that we take into consideration when we build our guidance. At the same time, we remain very optimistic in multiple fronts. We remain optimistic on the fact that -- as I commented before, when I was talking about medtech, the strong underlying demand for healthcare is there. And there's still lots to do in multiple diseases in order to address suffering and death there. So there's a strong underlying demand for medical care. And at the same time, both in medtech and in biopharmaceuticals, you see significant opportunity for science progress in terms of new treatment modalities that will give us the opportunity to enrich our pipeline and get to more patients. So we are optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of the new Johnson & Johnson. If you combine that with our scale and diversification, that gives us more confidence on being able to provide a consistent, solid volume-based revenue growth in 2022 as we have described and at the same time, being able to have EPS growth which exceeds our revenue growth. All that is underpinned by a strong investment in R&D. It's important to underline what Joe commented before, we had a record year of investment in R&D in 2021 with close to 21% increase. This is not going to be every year like that, but we are really betting on the future and on the underlying fundamentals when we are thinking about 2022 and beyond.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Joanne. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatthew Miksic: So I have one follow-up on just the topic you were touching on, Joaquin, around R&D investment, and then I\u2019ve a follow-up for Joe, if I could, on inflationary pressure. So you mentioned a couple of times the investments in R&D and in particular, in med devices. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about which one of your -- ones of your programs you're sort of seeing the most investment? And then also in particular, either through R&D investment or M&A, how you see sort of digital playing a role in your sort of organic and strategic investments this year? And the follow-up for Joe is just on inflation. It's a topic that I think everyone is struggling with how to understand the ways that this is impacting margins and businesses. Joe, you mentioned a couple of things about the way that you're offsetting some of these pressures in consumer, perhaps labor and supply costs. I was wondering if you could maybe just touch on the different ways it's affecting your different businesses and how you're managing through that? I appreciate that.\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. So Matt, let me start with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and how we're offsetting those. So in consumer, there's, I would say, select products within the portfolio, think Skin Health and Beauty, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, where lubricants and things of that nature are in shorter supply. There are some, I'd say, probably increased labor costs with respect to third-party manufacturers, and we're obviously seeing heightened transportation costs. We are like the competitors in the consumer space, offsetting some of those costs with select price increases in our portfolio, where we can still provide those trusted brands and products to people without really impacting the elasticity or the demand of those products overall. We think we can strike that right balance as others have. In Medical Devices, I would say it's around the labor input costs and some of the staffing related to COVID-19, I would say, in the sense of overstaffing to some degree, but those are costs that are clearly managed. They're much like Pharmaceuticals are not prices that we can increase. And then, in fact, the stellar performance that you saw in pharmaceuticals was the sixth consecutive year where we actually had negative price. So the growth that you see is more than 100% of volume due to the innovation and the ability to address unmet medical needs. And then with Medical Devices, most of those specifically in the U.S. are contractual by nature. So there's limited opportunity there as well. So where we can, specifically in consumer, we're looking to pass some of those cost increases on. In other spots, we continue to have supply chain initiatives, manufacturing initiatives that have been in place really for a number of years as part of our overall cost management program.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. So going into medtech, R&D and medtech innovation, let me start by the fact that during 2021, we launched over 20 significant products across each segment of the Medical Device business. Some examples of that, for example, in electrophysiology, we had a limited launch of our QDOT MICRO in Europe. QDOT is a first-in-kind smart micro catheter, which is designed to deliver about 2x to 3x the amount of energy; and at the same time, reduce the total patient exposure and provided exposure to fluoro and reduced total procedure time. And that's helping us in driving our position in electrophysiology. In Orthopedics, we continue our enhancements in orthopedic knees, both with the differentiated next-generation VELYS Robotic-Assisted system. And at the same time, we had the introduction in December of the ATTUNE Cementless fixed bearing base. So these introductions are making us more competitive in the knee space, in the knee arena. In advanced surgery, we have some augmentations to energy to our energy portfolio with our ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer. And in Vision, we introduced our ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL contact lenses; and in Surgical Vision, our intraocular lenses, TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. So great innovation, which is driving our better performance in market performance. When it comes to our pipeline, there are a number of exciting things coming up, for example, our next-generation diagnostic catheter in electrophysiology and also a potential solution in pulsed field ablation. So all these areas make us believe that we're going to remain extremely competitive in electrophysiology. We continue to prioritize the expansion of our VELYS digital surgery potentially into the hip space and also foot and ankle solutions in orthopedics. And specifically, to your question on digital surgery, that's a very important area for us. We have a bold ambition there, and we are already making progress. The first launch was our MONARCH robotic system. Our MONARCH robotic system, it's enabling in the luminal bronchoscopies. And we have already launched it in the U.S., and it's progressing really well. And we are also studying our MONARCH robotic system to deliver energy and also a payload of pharmaceuticals for being able to do local treatment of early lung cancer lesions. At the same time, we have also submitted a 510(k) expansion of MONARCH for a potential treatment in kidney stones that will give us an expanded market in this area. I commented on our successful launch of our robotic system with VELYS, and we recognize that we will have to continue to be committed to develop in Ottava and entering into the general surgery market with a highly competitive offering, and we are working through that as soon as possible, and we will provide updates as we progress.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Matt. Rob, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thanks so much for taking the question. And Joaquin, welcome to your new position. Good to hear you on the call. Just a question on M&A. I mean that seems to be a hot topic, seems to be a more aggressive stance there. And specifically, in Medical Devices, just thinking about the commentary around preference and tuck-ins. But you have some larger players with a broader presence in areas where you guys actually have pretty significant gap. And these players do have the 1 or 2 position in most of these markets, albeit it's a mix of some higher growth versus some lower growth markets, but certainly gives you the scale that seems like is the direction that the market might be moving in. Just curious if you can comment on sort of how you're balancing the approach to building out further a competitive Medical Device portfolio versus sort of getting it with scale or doing a bunch of tuck-ins that ultimately get you there maybe 5, 10 years down the line? Just wanted to see if you guys could comment on how you're thinking about that.\nJoaquin Duato: As I have commented in the past occasion, Danielle, our preference is clearly both in medtech and in pharma to look for earlier-stage deals or smaller tuck-in deals in which we can deploy our own capabilities in development, manufacturing and commercialization in order to create value. And that's where we have been successful, and we are always trying to look for opportunities in that context in market segments that are going to enable us to enter into higher growth areas or to complement through adjacencies our existing portfolio. So that is the way we have been creating value in a very significant way, both in pharma and in medtech. While our past history always suggest smaller deals, as I said before, we don't have an artificial ceiling as far as far as deal size. It has to be something that has to be workable financially and in terms of value creating for shareholders. And typically larger deals are harder to make work both financial and operationally. So that's where we make it more of an emphasis in areas where we have a higher chance of creating value. We are open to midsized and larger deals, and we have demonstrated that we have done that in the past like we did, for example, with Actelion, but we tend to prefer this small new molecule, new device that we can, as I said before, apply a lot of our scientific technology, regulatory expertise and ultimately create this $1 billion platforms that we have, both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals. So that's our preference. That's our strategy, but we always remain open to investigate any opportunity or possibility that may be out there. It just has a higher bar from a financial and operational perspective.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Danielle. We have time for one last question. Rob, last question please.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. And Joaquin, welcome. A question on STELARA. The loss of exclusivity obviously coming up in September of 2023. Can you update us on your thinking about what the erosion curve could look like? I think that there's some underpinnings in terms of different indications that have been growing. A major competitor with a similarly year, a major blockbuster product in the I&I category has that. And they said that they could update the thinking perhaps towards midyear. Is there a similar update that you might be able to provide? How can we learn more about what the STELARA biosimilar erosion could look like?\nJoaquin Duato: Chris, and let me take this opportunity also to express how optimistic we are about the future of Pharmaceuticals, and we express in our Pharmaceutical R&D Day that we are very confident of being able to continue to deliver above market growth through the STELARA patent expiration in the U.S. And we are also very confident on the strength that we are showing also in immunology, for example, with TREMFYA, growing 88% and really exceeding expectations. So we are very confident on the potential of TREMFYA, which has exceeded already $2 billion in sales and has gained share both in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. So very, very positive about the future of our Pharmaceutical portfolio and also about the strength of STELARA in the immunology market. Regarding the erosion of STELARA, we are going to provide you updates as time goes by. We'll see how things play out with the competitor that it's going to go patent. We'll also learn from our experience with REMICADE, which will be a very good proxy for us and have no doubt, as we approach 2023, we'll be able to provide you a more accurate guidance of what we expect. We -- as I said, we remain optimistic that we'll be able to deliver growth during the STELARA patent expiration every single year. Thank you, Chris. \nJessica Moore: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, everyone, and thank you for your comments and questions today in this my first call as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Every day, as I get into this job, I am reminded of the importance of our mission to continue to work in changing the trajectory of health for humanity. And it's a purpose that energizes everyone at Johnson & Johnson, the 140,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson. We are proud of our performance in 2021 and believe we are extremely well positioned for 2022. We look forward to keep you informed throughout the year. And until then, please be well. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joseph Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jess, and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our outlook for 2022. We continue to manage the implications of COVID-19 globally, but it is encouraging to see the resilience of our business, driven by the dedication of countless healthcare professionals and the 136,000 Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Their collective commitment and focus on providing healthcare solutions enabled us to deliver another year of strong financial performance. Our Pharmaceuticals segment delivered a tenth consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth. Medical Devices continued to manage through the ongoing impact of COVID-19 to experience a partial recovery, and Consumer Health grew competitively while navigating industry-wide supply constraints. All of this culminated in Johnson & Johnson posting adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 22% for the year, while also investing in our business for the future. We are well positioned as we head into 2022. Before we recap our year-end cash position and guidance for 2022, I'd like to touch on the announcement we made in the fourth quarter regarding our intent to separate our Consumer Health business to create 2 market-leading companies. As independent companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health company will each be better positioned to exercise more focused strategic and capital decisions. We intend for each company to possess compelling financial profiles that reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business, enabling each company to be in a position to enhance the strong results that you've come to expect. As far as where we stand in the process, we have established a very strong, largely separate team focused on advancing the separation. And the financial and operational work streams are well underway. As conveyed in November, the Board of Directors' intent is for the planned separation to occur through the capital markets, and there are multiple capital market separation pathways being considered. Depending on the pathway, there are different SEC requirements that must be adhered to. In order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways, we cannot, at this time, disclose specific Consumer Health financial information not previously disclosed or that which is associated with the separation. As such, you can expect that Consumer Health as well as the rest of our business will be reported as it has been reported previously for the entirety of 2022. We can, however, provide a high-level time line for some nonfinancial items, which may be of interest. In the first half of 2022, we anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health company, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with our previous communications we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment, working within the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Let's now discuss our 2021 year-end cash position and future capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of nearly $20 billion. At the end of 2021, we had approximately $32 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt for a net debt position of $2 billion. We are pleased that 2021 was another record year in terms of R&D investment at $14.7 billion, a 21% increase over our previous all-time high recorded in 2020. We recognize that investment in innovation is critical to our future growth profile and remains a top priority from a capital allocation standpoint. Given that we are at our lowest levels of net debt in almost 5 years, progressing towards a net cash position, we anticipate leaning in on some of our other capital allocation priorities beyond internal R&D. This includes building upon the 59 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. It also includes, as Joaquin has mentioned in recent forums, utilizing our cash to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps and play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. We will assess opportunities of all sizes. However, our preferred option is tuck-in deals, which typically offer greater value creation. It is also important to note that should we find the right opportunities, the Consumer Health separation work stream will not prevent us from forging ahead. And finally, with respect to capital allocation, modest share repurchases may be evaluated as part of our capital deployment actions. Let me provide a few comments regarding our guidance for full year 2022, which encompasses expectations for our 3 business segments. In our Pharmaceuticals business, we will continue to drive innovation and market-leading sales growth with continued expansion of existing brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and the recently launched RYBREVANT for lung cancer. We are particularly excited about the anticipated FDA approval for [CARVIC-T], our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We believe this medicine is best-in-class, showing unprecedented results in clinical trials. In our Medical Devices business, we expect COVID-19 and hospital staffing to continue to be a dynamic variable, likely more impactful in the first half of 2022 as we cycle through Omicron. Our 2022 guidance assumes continued medical devices market recovery, but it also assumes, as you have heard us say previously, enhanced competitiveness. Almost all of our priority platforms are holding or gaining share based on third quarter 2021 year-to-date information, illustrating the positive business momentum versus 2019 when only about 50% of our platforms were holding or gaining share. This improved market performance enables us to maximize the value of recently launched products. In Consumer Health, we are confident that our well-balanced portfolio positions us well. Consistent with current global macroeconomic trends, we are experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures, including higher input costs across our business and more significantly with respect to Consumer Health. These external challenges include availability and cost of certain commodities, labor and transportation. Similar to competitors, we are instituting price increases across our Consumer Health portfolio in 2022, enabling us to remain competitive as we continue to deliver the products that consumers love and trust. So with that backdrop, let's get into the details for the full year 2022 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. Starting with sales, we expect operational sales growth for the full year 2022 between 7.0% and 8.5%. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures to be negligible, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting the same range as adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.0% to 8.5% or $100.3 billion to $101.8 billion. Our 2022 sales guidance includes approximately $3 billion from our COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of this volume is outside of the U.S. for low and middle-income countries corresponding to previously signed advanced purchase agreements. As you know, we do not predict currency movement. But for context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.14, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 5.5% and 7.0% or 6.2% at the midpoint compared to 2021, representing a range of $98.9 billion to $100.4 billion for 2022. As done in the past, I will provide a few qualitative comments related to quarterly phasing. Starting with Consumer Health, the supply constraints that were mentioned as part of Jess' commentary for the quarter will continue into 2022. We estimate that the majority of that impact will be experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in the first quarter and primarily in Skin Health, Beauty. We, therefore, expect second half performance to outperform the first half. In Medical Devices, we expect some COVID-19 headwinds and hospital staffing shortages to continue into 2022, but anticipate market recovery as global health systems treat new patients and work through procedure backlogs. Given this, we expect market recovery to improve as the year progresses and greater contribution from the new products launched in 2021 for an overall better second half. Finally, in Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate our market-leading performance will be fairly stable throughout the year, with perhaps some modest adjustments for timing of events associated with alliance revenue or tenders. We are monitoring report surface by large insurers that recent office visits are slightly down in both primary care and specialists. I'll continue to go through the items on our P&L, starting with operating margin. We expect 2022 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage, partially offset by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs, as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and write-offs. We expect this to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2022, consistent with 2021 levels.  Finally, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $0 million and $100 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2022 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current assumptions for geographic mix and certain international tax legislation changes for research and development expenses in 2022. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.2% to 10.2% or 9.2% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.40 to $10.60 or $10.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 7.1% versus the prior year. We expect the company's COVID-19 vaccine to contribute approximately an incremental $0.20 to earnings per share in 2022. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'm now thrilled to welcome Joaquin Duato to his first earnings call as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin, as a colleague who has worked alongside you for the past several years, it's clear that healthcare and providing good health for everyone, everywhere is not just your business, but a passion. I am excited to welcome you in your new capacity and look forward to continuing to partner with you, the Executive Committee and our colleagues across the globe in our mission to change the trajectory of health for humanity.  Over to you, Joaquin. Yes, Louis, thanks for the question. This is Joe. I would just say, maybe to further elaborate on Joaquin's points, With respect to your question on valuations, it's really hard to say whether there's been a capitulation or a recognition that values have come down. I think we probably need to see a little bit longer period of that. I don't think things are out there necessarily on sale. But I will say that it really just takes 2 parties to agree on a valuation that makes sense. And a lot of times, the valuation is driven by the capabilities, the skills, the scientific expertise that we have that maybe that potential partner or acquired asset does not have at that time. So that's the kind of the way we look at it. Again, I don't think there's a capitulation, but we are seeking to use some of the cash on the balance sheet in a very disciplined, responsible way, that compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf where we can create great value. Yes, Larry, thanks for the question and your interest. I would say it's somewhat a tale of 2 cities. If you look at surgical procedure volume in the fourth quarter, it eroded over the months of October, November, December. I would say it was roughly flat in the early part of the quarter relative to 2019, which we think is a more appropriate comparison, to down about 5%. The most pronounced area was clearly Orthopedics, which is the most elective segment of our portfolio. However, there's probably some reason for optimism if you look at diagnostic volumes in the fourth quarter. So that average roughly, let's call it 7%. It was a little bit stronger in October than it was in December, but still very positive relative to levels that were experienced in 2019. So we think there is a backlog that is potentially building of diagnosed cases that have yet to be scheduled. That being said, as you've heard from a number of outlets at this point, it really is about the hospital staffing and being able to accommodate surgeries from that perspective. We are seeing reduced cases with respect to Omicron, and we think that will play favorably. The first couple of weeks in January and probably limiting this to a week, maybe 2, saw a little bit of a bleed over from what we experienced in December around surgical procedures. But I do think that's going to improve with each passing month and with each passing quarter as the year goes on. And then as you heard from Joaquin as well as Jess, we are favorably positioned to capitalize on a much more stable market, given our improved competitiveness from where we were just a few years ago, in addition to the enhanced pipeline. Last year, we introduced over 20 products, same expectation for this year as well. So once the market gets to be a little bit more stable, hopefully no more future variants, and hospital administrators who have done a great job through the pandemic continue to modify their plans to ensure appropriate staffing, we think we will be in a very good position to not only approach market growth, but hopefully exceed it. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. With respect to operating margins, I think the 50 basis points is probably something that is reasonable to expect this year given some of the inflationary pressures that we've outlined, likely to be experienced in the first half of this year. That being said, given the size of our company, we do think we can always improve kind of the infrastructure, our operating model to find some leverage in the P&L. I won't commit to any -- to say it's each and every year. I think that's going to be very much dependent upon the opportunities that are presented to us in any given year. And if we've got an opportunity to invest disproportionately in R&D, on a particular asset, we will do that, and we just have to size up that opportunity. But I do think as a general rule, given the size of our company, that we should find some opportunity to operate where we can leverage. I would like to see us as we separate the company, maybe be relabeled as more of a growth company. And therefore, we may reposition that, taking that top line growth and putting that back into the business. But as you can see, even in recent years, we've had, I would say, significant operating margin improvement, but we have not starved investment. R&D was up over last year's record-setting year by $2.6 billion or 20%, as Jess mentioned. So we feel that we're finding that right balance, and we'll continue to do so moving forward. And Chris, my job will be to keep him disciplined, right? But he's going to conduct that anyway. It's a great question, Joanne, and thank you for it. It's -- and it certainly has been a moving target as we had certain thoughts as '22 would shape up in the beginning of December to where we are actually ending up today. We've tried to address all the risks that are appropriate based on the information that we have as of January 26. And so we've taken into account, I think, a favorable outlook and an improving trend in Medical Devices, but also the fact that it's going to be a slower start to the year for some of the factors that we mentioned. The same type of position was taken with consumer and some of the supply constraints from some of our suppliers. So I think it's the right balance for where we stand today. We know from the last 2 years that things will likely change, and we'll adjust accordingly. In Pharmaceuticals, there's really not much of a change there. We expect that to be pretty stable. We enjoyed our 10th consecutive year of above-market growth, and we're planning for an 11th year in 2022. We did take note of some of the larger insurers who commented last week during their earnings calls about reduced office visits. So we'll continue to monitor that. But given the portfolio in Pharmaceuticals and various severe diseases that we address with our products, we don't see much change there. Yes. So Matt, let me start with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and how we're offsetting those. So in consumer, there's, I would say, select products within the portfolio, think Skin Health and Beauty, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, where lubricants and things of that nature are in shorter supply. There are some, I'd say, probably increased labor costs with respect to third-party manufacturers, and we're obviously seeing heightened transportation costs. We are like the competitors in the consumer space, offsetting some of those costs with select price increases in our portfolio, where we can still provide those trusted brands and products to people without really impacting the elasticity or the demand of those products overall. We think we can strike that right balance as others have. In Medical Devices, I would say it's around the labor input costs and some of the staffing related to COVID-19, I would say, in the sense of overstaffing to some degree, but those are costs that are clearly managed. They're much like Pharmaceuticals are not prices that we can increase. And then, in fact, the stellar performance that you saw in pharmaceuticals was the sixth consecutive year where we actually had negative price. So the growth that you see is more than 100% of volume due to the innovation and the ability to address unmet medical needs. And then with Medical Devices, most of those specifically in the U.S. are contractual by nature. So there's limited opportunity there as well. So where we can, specifically in consumer, we're looking to pass some of those cost increases on. In other spots, we continue to have supply chain initiatives, manufacturing initiatives that have been in place really for a number of years as part of our overall cost management program."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you all for my first earnings announcement as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. We appreciate everyone tuning in today, and thank you for your interest in our company. Despite continued and evolving impact from COVID-19 globally, Johnson & Johnson delivered another strong year of sales and earnings growth. Full year Johnson & Johnson adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% reflects the tenth consecutive year of adjusted operational above-market growth from Pharmaceuticals, the ongoing positive growth momentum from Medical Devices and continued competitive growth in Consumer Health. These strong results contribute to my confidence in our ability to achieve 2022 operational sales and earnings per share growth in the high single digits, with EPS growth that is higher than sales despite macroeconomic factors such as inflation. This, coupled with our differentiated portfolio of pipeline innovation, further strengthens my confidence in our long-term growth potential. In recent months, I have been busy meeting and listening to our customers, partners and members of the Johnson & Johnson family around the world. As part of these conversations, I have thought about the underlying constant of our business, the secret ingredient to our success. It is our people, their dedication and their eagerness to ask the toughest questions and seek the boldest and bravest answers. I'm deeply optimistic about our future, and I feel energized about the potential for our business. In the last 2 years, COVID-19 has changed global perceptions and attitudes towards healthcare. It has shown us that there is significant opportunity for change and improvement in order to better serve patients, customers and communities around the world. The global response to the pandemic has also created a renewed sense of optimism about the power of science. Around the world, people are focused on personal and societal health in new and urgent ways. And importantly, people are demanding that companies deliver on their promises and act with purpose. Johnson & Johnson will continue to answer that call. We strongly believe the future ahead of us looks brighter and healthier for every patient and consumer. We are determined to achieve this future, grounded by the same mission and credo that always guided us. In 2022, we will run our business as we always have, with these segments, maximizing opportunities for each individually. And I would like to share a bit about our near-term priorities as we focus on successfully creating a new independent Consumer Health company as well as continuing to build on our individual global leadership in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices while enhancing synergies, which uniquely position us to accelerate growth and bring differentiated therapies that span both segments. At the end of last year, I laid out my top 3 priorities for a new era for Johnson & Johnson, and those priorities remain unchanged. These priorities are equally important for our success and include driving Medical Devices to become a best-in-class performer. We continue to focus on improved execution as evidenced by market share momentum as well as our improved cadence of innovation and organic and inorganic expansion into higher growth markets and market segments. We have 11 platforms in Medical Devices, which are over $1 billion. And as we have shared previously, we are gaining or holding share in almost all of this. This includes building upon our global market-leading positions in areas like electrophysiology, biosurgery and contact lenses and gaining market share in areas where we have been more challenged like Surgical Vision. The team has also launched over 20 new products during 2021, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in orthopedics and 2 new intraocular lenses in Surgical Vision. Next, delivering on our Pharmaceutical business commitments and long-term growth goals. We are continuing to build upon our promising pharmaceutical pipeline, which we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth rates and are focused on our previously announced long-term goal of growing to a $60 billion segment by 2025. We are continuing to maximize the value of our existing medicines with 13 marketed medicines across 6 therapeutic areas, each to exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2025. We expect to file 36 significant line expansions for these 13 products through 2025. Here, it is important to note that these expansions are largely derisked because the products are in the market today, so there is good insight into their overall profiles. In addition, we expect 14 novel therapy filings through 2025, each with the potential to exceed $1 billion in revenue and 5 of this with the ability to exceed $5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the potential patent expiries as we have done in the past and continue to grow at above market rates. And finally, ensuring the successful creation of the new Consumer Health company.  In the coming year, we will take the steps necessary to be in a position to separate our Consumer Health business from our Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device businesses during 2023. This will advance more targeted business strategies, accelerate growth and deliver improved outcomes for both patients and consumers, which ultimately will deliver greater value to shareholders. Our Consumer Health business is competitive in terms of growth and over the past few years has made significant progress improving the margin profile. And as we advance towards a successful new stand-alone Consumer Health company, we will continue to drive this business with the same focus we always have. Our best-in-class team is delivering science-backed innovation across OTC, Skin Health and our Specialty business with a focus on digital, consumer-centric solutions and seamless end-to-end customer experience. As Joe noted, we continue to believe that a fit-for-purpose corporate structure and a dedicated capital allocation strategy will provide the Consumer Health business with the agility and flexibility to continue to grow its iconic portfolio of brands and innovate new products in the fast-paced consumer market. And we expect this new and independent company, with nearly $15 billion in 2021 sales, will continue to be a global leader in the consumer health industry. And the new Johnson & Johnson at nearly $80 billion in sales in 2021 will continue to be the largest, most diversified healthcare company in the world and will retain the benefits of scale. We'll enhance our ability to be more focused with our operations, making the new Johnson & Johnson poised to bring integrated and comprehensive care to patients through the use of new technology and innovative science. As we continue to focus on our 3 sectors today, we have no intention of sitting on the sidelines. Our strong financial position, along with the clear priorities we have for our business, position us well to deliver near-term financial expectations and invest for the long-term value creation. We'll have the flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and maintain our track record of growing our dividend while aspiring to be bolder with strategic value-creating acquisitions that will enhance the new Johnson & Johnson in higher growth markets. At this critical time for healthcare and our global society, we understand the significant role we play, and we accept the responsibility and challenges of the future. I hope you will all join us as we step forward into this new era. Thank you. And with that, let me turn it back to Jess to open the Q&A. Thank you. Thank you for the question. As we commented, our strong financial performance in 2021 is enveloped in a very strong financial profile, giving us the latitude to manage both for the long-term while meeting the short-term expectations of the financial community. As Joe commented, too, we are about to turn from a net debt to a net cash position for the first time in over 4 years. So we'll have to -- we'll have the flexibility to continue to grow our dividend, be bolder in strategic acquisitions and enhance the new J&J position in higher growth markets. And if warranted, we also would consider share repurchase programs. I believe that these priorities position us well for the future. And I think it's important to consider that when we get into 2022, we'll continue to manage the business strategically, one. The separation and the creation of the new consumer company, it's not going to slow us down of any priorities. So we continue to think about how we are going to opportunistically deploy cash for both organic and inorganic initiatives. And in other words, I wanted to make clear that if the right opportunities are there, in medtech and pharmaceuticals, the work stream of the separation won't held us back from forging ahead. When it comes to Pharmaceuticals, as you mentioned, we presented our outlook for the business in our November R&D review. And we explained to you that we were anticipating -- we are anticipating above-market growth rates reaching $60 billion by 2025, growing every single year there. So when we think about those results, it's important to remember that we do not factor there any future acquisitions or collaborations and that we are confident to reach those goals without inorganic activity. That said, one of the pillars of our success has been our agnostic view related to innovation and our desire to lean in for the new Johnson & Johnson for opportunities to build our current portfolio and our current portfolio, both in pharma and medtech remains there, and we need to look for that to enhance our growth profile. In fact, over the past 5 years, our investments in organic R&D and externally sourced innovation have been about equal. We continue to look to opportunities to be able to enhance our pharmaceutical portfolio. And we have been very proficient in identifying opportunities that have a high probability of success very early on as we have done, for example, with Legend. And also, we have been good looking at the post proof-of-concept opportunities like we did with Momenta. In the future, we'll continue to look for all types of opportunities early on post proof-of-concept. And we also will look at other opportunities of large size that we'll have to fulfill higher from a financial perspective, given the higher operational complications that these opportunities may take. But yes, we are constantly looking at M&A as a key source of growth for our business. Our position in cash today makes us been more aggressive in that area, and we'll continue with our focus on taking acquisitions, but not excluding, if the situation is granted, to look at medium-sized also opportunities. Yes, I would continue building up on Joe's comment that as the Omicron surge resolves, we anticipate that the markets will continue to improve as the year progresses. It is very difficult to predict when Omicron is going to peak, but we are beginning already to see cases decreasing in areas where the surge began like, for example, in the UK, and some regions in the U.S. already nearing peaks. So while COVID-19 may temporarily delay necessary medical and surgical interventions, the vast majority of these procedures cannot be ignored completely. And at the same time, hospitals, as Joe was referring, are getting better dealing with these situations. So while the path is not going to be linear, we expect an improvement as the year starts to go on and the fundamentals of the medtech market remain intact with disease prevalence and the need for surgery and change. So we believe we are optimistic of the value of the market in the long term, and we are optimistic about our medtech business and its ongoing recovery and improvement in the overall competitive position. So when we are facing 2022 on the medtech side, both from a market perspective and also from a Johnson & Johnson perspective, we look at it optimistically. And we think that the situation will clearly improve as Omicron surge resolves and the year progresses. Thank you, Joe. So overall, as I have commented in our Pharmaceutical Analyst Day and also in the different conferences that I have participated, medtech, it's going to be a key priority for me in my tenure. I see medtech and pharmaceuticals being the core of the new Johnson & Johnson that, as Joe commented, will remain the largest and more diversified healthcare company. So clearly, medtech, it's going to be a key area of focus for us in every aspect. When it comes to medtech and its market performance, I have to highlight that we have seen a very clear ongoing recovery in our medtech performance. We went from 1.5% growth in 2017 to nearly 4% in 2019, and we are ending the year at 4.6%. And when you adjust for the 53rd week, we are in about 5%. So we are clearly improving our performance in the medtech space, driven by some market segments which are really delivering in a very strong way. For example, in interventional, our growth ending the year was 15.3%. Our ambition, our growth in the year was 11%. So we have clearly outstanding performance there. And in most of the platforms that we participate, we are gaining share or maintaining share, improving our position. It's difficult for me to bracket exactly what the growth is going to be and when it's going to happen. But our goal clearly is to make our medtech sector a best-in-class performer. So that's going to be a defining element of my tenure, and we are going to be working towards that. We are going to be improving our commercial execution as we are doing today. We'll continue to invest in our organic pipeline that is delivering. We have had the highest level of innovation in our medtech business in 2021 ever, and our pipeline today has the highest value as measured by net present value that we have ever had. And also, we recognize that we need to do and we need to continue to be active in external innovation in order to be able to participate in markets where growth is occurring that we are not participating today or to build upon adjacencies our existing businesses that are going to further our growth. So as in any business, when it comes to their business allocation, we'll continue to drive our winners, and we'll try to efficiently manage the areas in which we are more challenged. And we'll continue to look for opportunities externally that will complement our portfolio and will enable us to enter into higher growth markets. Overall, our past acquisitions suggest that we have been good in managing smaller deals and tacking deals, and that is our base case. But at the same time, we don't have an artificial ceiling in our deal size. We are always looking for any opportunity that exist in the marketplace. But as I said before, when I was commenting about pharmaceuticals, we do know that larger deals are much harder to make work, both financially and operationally, and they will always have a higher bar. So very important for us and for the new Johnson & Johnson, the focus in our medtech business and how much we are going to prioritize this area of our business. And when it comes to your question, Chris, about M&A in the medtech business. Our aspiration in medtech is to be the first or the second in the markets that we participate. And if we are in markets that -- if we are not in markets that are growing, also have a path to get there, right? Recently, we have divested some of the businesses like diagnostics, pain, diabetes, where we came to the conclusion that it was difficult to get into this #1, #2 position, and that was better to sell that business in order to create value. So given the recent investment activity, what I want to emphasize and I have alluded at the outset is that my priority now is to be more on the acquisitive side and to be more aggressive on the acquisition side, identifying products that complement our portfolio but play in higher growth markets or market segments that we are today. So that's the change in outlook that you are noticing. I would add to that, that just we take into consideration some of the headwinds related to pandemic and also macroeconomic headwinds like inflation, and that's something that we take into consideration when we build our guidance. At the same time, we remain very optimistic in multiple fronts. We remain optimistic on the fact that -- as I commented before, when I was talking about medtech, the strong underlying demand for healthcare is there. And there's still lots to do in multiple diseases in order to address suffering and death there. So there's a strong underlying demand for medical care. And at the same time, both in medtech and in biopharmaceuticals, you see significant opportunity for science progress in terms of new treatment modalities that will give us the opportunity to enrich our pipeline and get to more patients. So we are optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of the new Johnson & Johnson. If you combine that with our scale and diversification, that gives us more confidence on being able to provide a consistent, solid volume-based revenue growth in 2022 as we have described and at the same time, being able to have EPS growth which exceeds our revenue growth. All that is underpinned by a strong investment in R&D. It's important to underline what Joe commented before, we had a record year of investment in R&D in 2021 with close to 21% increase. This is not going to be every year like that, but we are really betting on the future and on the underlying fundamentals when we are thinking about 2022 and beyond. Thank you. So going into medtech, R&D and medtech innovation, let me start by the fact that during 2021, we launched over 20 significant products across each segment of the Medical Device business. Some examples of that, for example, in electrophysiology, we had a limited launch of our QDOT MICRO in Europe. QDOT is a first-in-kind smart micro catheter, which is designed to deliver about 2x to 3x the amount of energy; and at the same time, reduce the total patient exposure and provided exposure to fluoro and reduced total procedure time. And that's helping us in driving our position in electrophysiology. In Orthopedics, we continue our enhancements in orthopedic knees, both with the differentiated next-generation VELYS Robotic-Assisted system. And at the same time, we had the introduction in December of the ATTUNE Cementless fixed bearing base. So these introductions are making us more competitive in the knee space, in the knee arena. In advanced surgery, we have some augmentations to energy to our energy portfolio with our ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer. And in Vision, we introduced our ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL contact lenses; and in Surgical Vision, our intraocular lenses, TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. So great innovation, which is driving our better performance in market performance. When it comes to our pipeline, there are a number of exciting things coming up, for example, our next-generation diagnostic catheter in electrophysiology and also a potential solution in pulsed field ablation. So all these areas make us believe that we're going to remain extremely competitive in electrophysiology. We continue to prioritize the expansion of our VELYS digital surgery potentially into the hip space and also foot and ankle solutions in orthopedics. And specifically, to your question on digital surgery, that's a very important area for us. We have a bold ambition there, and we are already making progress. The first launch was our MONARCH robotic system. Our MONARCH robotic system, it's enabling in the luminal bronchoscopies. And we have already launched it in the U.S., and it's progressing really well. And we are also studying our MONARCH robotic system to deliver energy and also a payload of pharmaceuticals for being able to do local treatment of early lung cancer lesions. At the same time, we have also submitted a 510(k) expansion of MONARCH for a potential treatment in kidney stones that will give us an expanded market in this area. I commented on our successful launch of our robotic system with VELYS, and we recognize that we will have to continue to be committed to develop in Ottava and entering into the general surgery market with a highly competitive offering, and we are working through that as soon as possible, and we will provide updates as we progress. As I have commented in the past occasion, Danielle, our preference is clearly both in medtech and in pharma to look for earlier-stage deals or smaller tuck-in deals in which we can deploy our own capabilities in development, manufacturing and commercialization in order to create value. And that's where we have been successful, and we are always trying to look for opportunities in that context in market segments that are going to enable us to enter into higher growth areas or to complement through adjacencies our existing portfolio. So that is the way we have been creating value in a very significant way, both in pharma and in medtech. While our past history always suggest smaller deals, as I said before, we don't have an artificial ceiling as far as far as deal size. It has to be something that has to be workable financially and in terms of value creating for shareholders. And typically larger deals are harder to make work both financial and operationally. So that's where we make it more of an emphasis in areas where we have a higher chance of creating value. We are open to midsized and larger deals, and we have demonstrated that we have done that in the past like we did, for example, with Actelion, but we tend to prefer this small new molecule, new device that we can, as I said before, apply a lot of our scientific technology, regulatory expertise and ultimately create this $1 billion platforms that we have, both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals. So that's our preference. That's our strategy, but we always remain open to investigate any opportunity or possibility that may be out there. It just has a higher bar from a financial and operational perspective. Chris, and let me take this opportunity also to express how optimistic we are about the future of Pharmaceuticals, and we express in our Pharmaceutical R&D Day that we are very confident of being able to continue to deliver above market growth through the STELARA patent expiration in the U.S. And we are also very confident on the strength that we are showing also in immunology, for example, with TREMFYA, growing 88% and really exceeding expectations. So we are very confident on the potential of TREMFYA, which has exceeded already $2 billion in sales and has gained share both in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. So very, very positive about the future of our Pharmaceutical portfolio and also about the strength of STELARA in the immunology market. Regarding the erosion of STELARA, we are going to provide you updates as time goes by. We'll see how things play out with the competitor that it's going to go patent. We'll also learn from our experience with REMICADE, which will be a very good proxy for us and have no doubt, as we approach 2023, we'll be able to provide you a more accurate guidance of what we expect. We -- as I said, we remain optimistic that we'll be able to deliver growth during the STELARA patent expiration every single year. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, everyone, and thank you for your comments and questions today in this my first call as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Every day, as I get into this job, I am reminded of the importance of our mission to continue to work in changing the trajectory of health for humanity. And it's a purpose that energizes everyone at Johnson & Johnson, the 140,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson. We are proud of our performance in 2021 and believe we are extremely well positioned for 2022. We look forward to keep you informed throughout the year. And until then, please be well. Thank you very much."

Moving to today's agenda, I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Joe will provide some additional business and financial commentary before providing an overview of our cash position and capital allocation, and then conclude with updated guidance on 2021 results. The remaining time will be available for your questions.  We anticipate the webcast to last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to the third quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.7% versus the third quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9.9% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points In the U.S., sales increased 7.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 13.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.1% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 10.6% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 13.5% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.37 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.33 a year ago.  Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, representing increases of 18.7% and 18.2% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.4%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the side you have in front of you, unless otherwise stated, percentage is quoted, represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.  Beginning with consumer health, worldwide consumer health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 5.7%. Although there is variability across the franchises due to the impact of COVID-19, the overall portfolio is performing well. When comparing to 2019, the consumer health business grew approximately 8% operationally in the quarter. Over-the-counter medicines saw strong growth of 18.2% globally due to share gains in the U.S., along with an increase of pediatric fever incidences and demand for vaccination symptom relief that drove increased sales of Tylenol and Motrin globally. Additionally, category recovery increased demand for cough, cold, flu, and Digestive Health brand such as IMODIUM.  Sales outside the U.S. benefited from prior-year comparisons, specifically prior-year reduction in consumption in China. Our skin health beauty franchise declined by 3% globally, largely due to the 330 basis point impact of the divestiture of Sedona, the salon-based portion of [Indiscernible] in Asia Pacific. Excluding this impact, the franchise experienced modest growth driven by strong performance in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA facial moisturizing and body care driven by COVID-19 market recovery and e-commerce growth, partially offset by external supply constraints and lost sales from the sun aerosol recall.  Oral Care declined 4.5% globally, largely due to the impact of divestitures worth approximately 300 basis points. Excluding this impact, the franchise declined due to external supply constraints for Listerine in the U.S. and negative comparisons to prior-year COVID-19 related impacts in EMEA, partially offset by strong performance in Asia-Pacific, driven by strong promotions and brand building behind Listerine's germ fighting ability. The baby care franchise declined 1.2% globally, resulting from Asia-Pacific COVID-19 lockdowns and competitive pressure, mostly offset by strong Aveeno performance, along with category and e-commerce growth in the U.S. Our Women's Health franchise grew 0.8% globally, primarily due to lapping prior-year COVID-19 impacts.  And finally, our Wound Care franchise declined 4.8% globally, driven by unfavorable comparisons to prior-year stocking in the U.S. and competitive pressure in Asia-Pacific. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13 billion increased 13.2% with growth of 12.2% in the U.S. and growth of 14.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 13.8%. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q3 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 200 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continue to enable us to deliver adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. The immunology portfolio delivered strong global sales growth of 11.7%, driven by double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition.  STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 21.7% driven by market growth and share gains of roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly seven points in all sort of colitis in the U.S. TREMFYA was up 63.5% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to continued positive share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and over 3 points in psoriatic arthritis. Oncology also delivered another strong quarter with global sales growth of 16.5%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 42.9% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU, and continued launches globally.  DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 5 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter, as an example. ERLEADA also continued its global uptake with growth of 65.8% in the quarter, driven by global market share gains, which increased in the U.S. alone by nearly 2 points across all indications led by the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 2.5% globally due to the brand's market leading share position, but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. and a market that remains constrained due to temporary COVID-19 impact on new patient starts.  In addition, growth was negatively impacted by a prior period adjustment in the U.S. that was worth nearly 350 basis points on worldwide IMBRUVICA growth. Neuroscience grew 4.6% globally, driven by paliperidone long-acting portfolio, posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency in the U.S. The cardiovascular, metabolism, and other business declined 12.4% globally due to competitive pressures and INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT.  Pulmonary hypertension achieved strong growth of 16.1% driven by OPSUMIT growth of 17.1% and UPTRAVI growth of 18.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. And lastly, global sales in the quarter included a $502 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the year-to-date total to 766 million.  Through the first 9 months of the year, revenue has been recorded at a not-for-profit price of $7.50. I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales of $6.6 billion increased 7% with growth of 0.8% in the U.S. and growth of 13.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 7.6%. In the medical devices segment, we have seen mixed marketplace recovery as the COVID-19 Delta variant and related factors impacted our sales across most of the categories in which we participate within the quarter with certain procedures such as spine and knees within Orthopedics deemed to be more elective in nature, continuing to lag in terms of recovery.  The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 13.2% driven by market recovery, success of new products in both electrophysiology and neurovascular, and strong commercial execution. Worldwide surgery grew 10.2%, primarily driven by recovering procedure volumes and market expansion in Asia Pacific. Advanced Surgery grew 12.6% globally, driven by the positive impact of procedure recovery, new product introductions, and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion across Endo cutters, biosurgicals, and energy, partially offset by continued competitive pressure in Endo cutters and energy in the U.S. Building on the MONARCH robotic milestone communicated last quarter, we reached another significant commercial achievement, now enabling over 10,000 bronchoscopy procedures. General Surgery grew 8.1% globally.  Wound Closure is the largest contributor with growth driven by procedure recovery, China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion, and continued competitive growth in both traditional and barbed suture markets. The Worldwide Orthopedics franchise declined 0.3% with U.S. declines of 4.5% reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on procedures within the quarter, partially offset by 6.8% OUS growth. Trauma grew 3.7% globally, 5.3% increase in the U.S., and a 0.9% increase outside the U.S.  Results reflect global market recovery dynamics and success of recent product introductions like our cannulated compression headless screws, advanced nailing systems and FIBULINK. Hips grew 2.3% globally, driven by recovery and procedures primarily outside the U.S. and continued leadership in the anterior approach supported by our robust portfolio of new products, such as ACTIS femoral stem, PINNACLE dual mobility and VELYS hip navigation. In Q3, we introduced new image guidance capability for VELYS hip navigation, which support surgeons who prefer the posterior approach in addition to the anterior approach.  Needs grew 2.1% this quarter, reflecting recovery of procedures, especially in markets outside of the U.S. Growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery channel and continued momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Results in the quarter also benefited from the timing of international tender orders worth approximately 350 basis points of global growth. Lastly, within Orthopedics, Spine declined 11% globally, driven primarily by a deceleration in procedure volume related to COVID-19.  The Worldwide Vision franchise grew 10% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery, commercial initiatives, and new products driving enhanced competitiveness. Contact lens global growth of 6.4% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives, and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL, and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. The decline of 4.3% in the U.S. includes a negative impact of prior year stocking worth about 10 points. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 22.1% driven by market recovery across all regions and success of recently launched products continuing to enhance competitiveness, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy.  Now, regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2021, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold improved by 200 basis points, driven by recovery from prior-year COVID-19 related impacts and favorable enterprise mix from growth in Pharmaceuticals. We continue to invest strategically in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 14.7% of sales this quarter. This $3.4 billion investment was a 20.5% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. In process research and development reflects a partial impairment expense of $900 million for assets associated with the acquisition of Auris. The other income and expense line changed from a net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2022 to net expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in litigation-related charges.  Joe will provide more details on both the IP R&D and litigation-related charges. Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020, mostly driven by unfavorable tax reserves and positions from the prior year, which did not reoccur. Along with lower income and higher tax jurisdictions driven by one-time current quarter special items. excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.5% versus 19% in the same period last year.  I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing For additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales remained fairly consistent to the prior year with some changes between our 3 segments.  Pharmaceutical margins declined from 46.4% to 43.9% driven by research and development investment to enable portfolio progression. Medical Devices margin improved from 21.6% to 25.5%, driven by recovery from prior-year COVID-19 related impacts and overall expense leveraging resulting from sales recovery. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 24.4% to 23.3%, driven by a 2020 one-time item and increased brand marketing expenses partially offset by COGS improvement. That concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\nJoseph Wolk : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflected continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses, and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies. How do we see the current medical device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August with the highest impacts consistently in those procedures deemed to be more elective, such as knees and spine.  Globally, new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the UK, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure volumes. We continue to believe these variables are more short-term in nature and the Medical Devices market remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have not changed due to COVID-19.  The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA HAFYERA, the first and only twice yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia, and we announced the start of a Phase 3 study of our investigational RSV vaccine in older adults. Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted [Indiscernible] drug designation for nipocalimab in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral nerves, characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes.  This represents nipocalimab 's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. However, we are stopping further investigation in the Fontan-palliated population of macitentan 10 milligram in pulmonary hypertension as results from the RUBATO Phase 3 trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit.  Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday the FDA 's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend emergency-use authorization for a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, at least 2 months following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical and real-world data showing that while a single-shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19.  We are very excited to share more about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business review on November 18th. In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions in the first half of 2021 by introducing the enhanced shoulder system in the third quarter, a first to market fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations.  We also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON Circular powered stapler is associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection. Let's transition to financials starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with a recently announced qualified settlement fund for current and future Talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final equitable resolution of all Talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent.  Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter representing final resolution of outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL. Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our MONARCH platform for lung bronchoscopy, and are well on our way to expanding MONARCH indications, including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer, and submitting an application to the FDA for MONARCH to be used in the treatment of kidney stones.  Our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S. has received several OUS approvals and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems place to date than we projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately two years from our earlier projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19 related disruptions, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries.  Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform and will provide updates to the external community as warranted. Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. Moving to our full-year 2021 guidance.  Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales consistent with our July guidance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13%, or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a midpoint of 12.7% or 93.1 billion.  As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 where $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion. Moving to other items of the P&L, consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year.  Given year-to-date trends, we are modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950 million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain one time favorable tax positions and settlements both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint. Well, not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share.  Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77 to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of employees around the globe, whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders.  We continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone everywhere, and I am grateful for their efforts and commitment. I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the increases last three years, and to observe and to learn from him both professionally and personally.  I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he shares the same commitment to patients, employees, and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be featured at the previously mentioned November 18th Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business and plans for the future. I am pleased our Worldwide Chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon, and Jennifer Taubert are here with me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre, from our Investor Relations team, will facilitate the Q&A portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A. Jen.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: Sure. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, [Operator Instructions]. Please limit your questions to 1 question only. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I guess just first, can you just quantify or elaborate on the impact that the Delta variant head on 3Q results in your guidance. I guess I'm trying to get to was the impact you saw in the third quarter basically in line with what you had contemplated in guidance, or did we have upside elsewhere in the portfolio that offset some of those slowdowns that you mentioned that hit part of the businesses? And then just maybe building on that as we think out to 2022, I know you're not giving guidance yet, but is there more in the way of COVID recovery that can aid growth next year as you think about the portfolio as a whole? I guess I'm trying to get to this base pharma growth sustainable at these levels. And should we think about still Device growth, maybe above historic levels as we get COVID more in the rearview mirror a bit? Thanks so much.\nJoseph Wolk : Yes, Chris. So this is Joe Wolk. Let me answer some of it quantitatively and then maybe I'll hand it over to Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments. In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if you look at what I guess has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in two categories. The vaccine, quite frankly. And as you saw, we did not change the full-year guidance. So that is simply timing.  We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter and we're still very much committed to the 2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that. With respect to medical devices, I think we're very pleased that we had above 7% growth in the quarter, given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early next year, so that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022. But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on medical devices and then to Jennifer to discuss pharmaceuticals.\nAshley Mc Evoy : Sure. Thanks, Joe. And thanks for the question, Chris. When I look at quarter three as we share, procedures across most categories in which we participated did decelerate through the quarter, primarily due to obviously the Delta. So if I take you a little bit around the world, Asia-Pacific in aggregate continues to operate above pre - COVID levels. However, COVID does continue to be a challenge with like mobility restrictions being reinstated or remaining in places like Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia.  China clearly is setting a new pace for the world. When we look in the United States, we saw procedure trends decelerate in quarter 3. You'll recall on our quarter 2 call, we were feeling pretty good around 5% growth procedures in May. We saw a stabilization in June and July. In August, we saw the numbers of procedures dip around mid-single digit, and we saw that continue into the early part of September.  We are starting to see, qualitatively, recovery from hospital systems the past four weeks, where we look at early indicators of really filling the patient funnel. We look at diagnostic procedures and the past four weeks we're seeing diagnostic procedures in the United States flat relative to pre-COVID numbers. And as we talked about, we do expect some micro-surges in areas like the Northwest as well as the Midwest.  And then, in EMEA, rounding it out, we are encouraged that countries are beginning to ease its strict mobility restrictions and are really starting to resume procedures, given the vaccine deployment accelerations, the decrease in rates of new cases and hospitalizations, and overall, procedure volumes are gradually improving, like Spain, Italy, Germany are all above pre -COVID. The UK, where I was just there 2 weeks ago, clearly below 2019, long waiting list, really working to go, make progress on that patient funnel. I'll turn you to Jennifer for any other commentary.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thanks, Ashley. And hi, Chris. So we've got a real positive outlook on the pharmaceutical business, and if you take a look at our third quarter results, we had clear double-digit growth across a number of our key brands, including DARZALEX and ERLEADA in oncology, TREMFYA and STELARA in immunology, and OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI in pulmonary hypertension. Those areas we have seen strong recovery and we believe that the trajectory on those assets is really going to continue, so continued trajectory in '21 and into '22.  The area part of the market where we're still seeing a bit of a slower recovery, but we're starting to see it tick back, is really in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, the market where IMBRUVICA is right now for IMBRUVICA, we just achieved double-digit growth ex-U.S. but in the U.S., it's actually been a little bit lower than that. And so I think that's one that, as you take a look and we move into 2022, we're anticipating to see some positive recovery there, but really strong results in 3Q and we anticipate continued strong trajectory through the rest of the year and into '22.\nJoseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Ashley and Jennifer and Chris, I know you asked about medical devices and pharmaceuticals. But to be complete, Thibaut I know you had great success in the quarter, 6%, almost 9% when you compare to Q3 of 2019, maybe give a little bit of an outlook as to what you're seeing for the balance of the year and into next?\nThibaut Mongon: Yes, certainly, Joe. As you just said, consumer segment continues to experience very strong momentum. So we are very pleased with how the portfolio continues to perform around the world. Clearly this quarter, the star is our OTC segment growing double-digit with a continued strong demand for trusted brands in allergenics, but also Digestive Health, continued demand in smoking cessation as well. So across all categories and around the world, continued strong demand for our product. As we get into Q4 and into 2022, we expect our portfolio of brands to continue to be very well positioned in the markets and categories in which we compete. Our brand -- many of our brands iconic, and we would expect continued growth for this brand around the world.\nJoseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Thibaut. Jen, back to you.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thank you for your question, Chris. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.\nJosh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to just circle up on the announcements around the tax litigation and the process that J&J is undergoing. Is there any way -- I know you're not going to talk about -- deeply about the strategy, but just thinking about milestones for this process and any way you can help us understand when this strategy will be fully cleared and in play, and I guess stamp of approval by the bankruptcy courts or how should we thinking about this process through the rest of this year and into 2022?\nJoseph Wolk : Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. Let me start this response by underscoring just our conviction in the safety based on decades of science that these products are safe. What we've done is acknowledge that there's an established process that allows companies facing abuse of toward systems to resolve claims in an efficient and equitable manner. We initiated this process specifically for our cosmetic talc claims, both for current and future. And while we believe the cases lack merit, and by the way, an overwhelming number of courts, juries, and judges who have opined on this to full adjudication ultimately agree with us.  We did establish a $2 billion qualified settlement fund. But as you note in your question Josh, it's really the bankruptcy courts that will ultimately decide this. It's not plaintiff's attorneys. It's not Johnson & Johnson. But we do know that based on prior experience precedent, that claimants are far better off and clarity and resolution is in the best interest of all stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the process, but we're really beholden to how the bankruptcy court decides to proceed and their timeline.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thanks, Josh. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one for Ashley. Just Ashley, it looks like Q3 growth in devices relative to 2019 was about 4%. Could you confirm that? And what are your expectations for Q4 relative to that metric -- relative to Q4, 2019 after adjusting for one less week. I think people are trying to understand if Q4 growth could be better than Q3 on an underlying basis versus 2019. And how are you thinking about the staffing shortages and supply constraints that I think Joe alluded to and inflation. How are you thinking about those factors that people are concerned about in the device industry? Thanks for taking the question.\nAshley Mc Evoy : Thanks for the question, Larry. And before I get to quarter 4, let me just give a quick frame for quarter 3 just at a macro level. First is really the market. And while COVID-19 has temporarily disrupted the MedTech markets, we absolutely believe that the underlining foundation of these end-state markets continue to remain attractive really due to what we say are oodles of clinical unmet need and quite frankly, the overall state of the technology on the S-curve. Quick refresh is our standing and our competitiveness as the second largest MedTech Company with 11 platforms delivering at least a billion in annual sales, we are very much focused on competitiveness and innovation.  In quarter 2, almost all of our priority platforms held or gained share. Some notables include continuing to enhance our global market position in electrophysiology. Biosurgery gaining share and hips seeing the impact of recent innovation in surgical vision. Now seeing several sequential quarters of share gains and even seen stabilization in knees year-to-date. So this is really about our focus on commercial effectiveness and our ability to deliver innovation. As Joe mentioned earlier, in 2021, we had 17 new product launches year-to-date. And this is a significant amount over last year.  So year-to-date through 2021, Larry, we are tracking to 5% growth versus 2019. We did achieve 4% growth in quarter 3. Obviously, that's an improvement of how we exited 2019 the full year. And then last, I would just say, you heard us talk a lot about digital surgery. We're absolutely committed to leading in the future of surgery and making our medical innovation smarter, less invasive, and more personalized. Joe talked a little bit about our MONARCH reaching 10,000 patients this year, has a very rich pipeline.  VELYS Knees is now approved in 5 countries. Our smart digital tools continue to scale. And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard us share we're experiencing a temporary setback in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun, I will tell you. It's highly complex, but sometimes we do experience technical challenges, but we are absolutely committed to resolving our challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive differentiated offering as soon as possible.  When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going to have to continue to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4 nor in 2022, but they've been quite master rolling how to manage patient flows. We are when I talk to hospital systems over the past three weeks and particularly in United States, they are ramping up again and resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patients sentiment, the cold weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thanks for your question, Larry. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about some of the management changes that were announced and how we should think about what could change or what could stay the same under a new CEO and CSO. And then, any anticipated changes to business mix between Pharma Med Device and consumer as a result of new leadership? Thank you.\nJoseph Wolk : Thanks, Louise, for the question. I'll try to address that one. What I would say is, first off, I'd probably repeat the words I had both to congratulate Alex, as well as Joaquin. Alex clearly on a stellar career, a great run as his tenure as CEO. And he'll be a very active Executive Chairman, I suspect. It's not as if he's riding completely off into the sunset. Joaquin values the same principles that have made Johnson & Johnson successful.  That's investing in innovation and making sure that we've got differentiated products and solutions to improve the standard of healthcare across the globe. The nice thing about the transition is, I don't expect any significant bumps. They've worked together for a number of years. The strategies that they have talked about and that you'll probably see in the early part of Joaquin 's tenure have been contemplated with Alex in mind and they've collaborated as Chair and Vice Chair over a number of years.  So I would expect as the organization does a very smooth transition. With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had on the scientific community not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HID, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And then just most recently his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again here at J&J but also on the global stage. I think the -- probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year is 23% higher through nine months than what it was last year, and last year was a record-setting year in terms of what we've invest in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to the success that they will continue to carry on that Paul has really, I guess, cemented in terms of how we approach our business.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Louise, thanks for your question. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping you could focus a little bit on the upcoming BCMA CAR-T launch and just talk a little bit about how you think about your capacity to supply that market and your preparations for that launch. Thanks.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Sure. Hi, it's Jennifer. So we are really looking forward to our upcoming PDUFA date in the 4th quarter for our BCMA CAR-T. This is going to be our first entry into cell therapy, and so the total team from R&D to supply chain to commercial has been really, really invested in this asset over the past couple of years preparing to launch. I think the results that you've all seen, and they're really deep and durable responses that have been proven through our clinical programs really highlight that this is going to be a really meaningful and transformational asset for patients.  As we have been planning the launch, we're really taking a thoughtful approach to scaling our global manufacturing, making sure that we're learning from those who come before us, and that we're really going to plan to deliver an optimal patient experience and patient treatment or provider treatment center experience as well as we scale up.  So the team has been working very heavily on this and we're gearing up for what we believe will be a very successful launch for patients hopefully later this year. I also want to call out the very strong partnership that we have with Legend Biotech, where we've been attached at the hip throughout and we're so excited to be working in partnership with them to be bringing that to market. I'm looking forward to a good launch later this year.\nAshley Mc Evoy : Thanks, Jennifer. Bob, thanks for your question, Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So I had one for Ashley, just on the knee business in the U.S. and one quick follow-up if I could on COVID vaccines. So Ashley, I think one of the things that was mentioned was sort of continued growth and expansion around the knee business, if I'm not mistaken and in ASCs, and obviously the VELY's launch. If you could talk, maybe ASC, I guess, needs or something that we [Indiscernible] regional fluctuation around the U.S. is to uptake some areas stronger than others and love to get your sense of how that's progressing, where it's stronger and why, and how you see that playing out and as I mentioned, one follow-up on vaccines.\nAshley Mc Evoy : Thank you for the question, Matt. As Sarah shared in quarter 3, knees grew 2% versus 2020, and a lot of that was due to really two-folds. One is the state of innovation, so the VELYS knee robot is obviously getting some nice traction. As Joe shared earlier, the utilization rates are very encouraging from hospital systems that have adopted this new technology. That coupled with a very proven differentiated ATTUNE knee implant, with a revision offering, as well as the cementless rotating platform have all really helped [Indiscernible] up, I would say, our portfolio in knees.  And then you mentioned the channel and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We continue to be encouraged by our market share gains predominantly enjoined in ASC. And really we started to deploy what we call an advanced case management, which is really how you simplify the pre -op planning in ASC and that new advanced case management service is starting to really take effect. And we expect to have these new sites of care start to really improve not just in [Indiscernible], not just in the U.S., but even in areas of Europe and really moving joints to more of a day surgery. Thank you for the question.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thanks, Ashley. Matt, you want to ask your vaccine follow-up.\nMatthew Harrison: Just we hadn't touched on it this call, but the sort of pivot to commercial, would love to get your sense of how we should think about timing and the sort of catalysts for that product becoming a commercial product, whether next year or the year after.\nAshley Mc Evoy : Yeah. So we're really proud of the role that our vaccine's playing and really helping address the global COVID pandemic throughout the world. And hopefully, you saw last week that the FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended a booster for our COVID vaccine. We are in the process right now of continuing under emergency use authorization to roll-out our vaccine across the globe in both in developed markets, as well as developing markets.  I think as the pandemic, as we continue to work through and fulfill our existing contracts that we have throughout the globe, and as we move into more of a booster market in later '22, potentially into 2023, we'd be looking at moving into a more of a commercial market. I know our R&D team is gearing up and getting ready to file for full approval. I think we want to be moving into a full approval market for that switchover to commercial.\nJoseph Wolk : Matt, this is Joe. Thanks for raising the point because I do think that underscores in that question just the strength of our core business, right? So vaccines in and of itself this year is not for profit. As Jennifer said, we'll rely on the science and the data to guide us how we proceed commercially.  But you should all consider that as upside to our base plan. We're so proud of the results that we've been able to accomplish, the investment in R&D, and just the strength of the portfolio not just this year, but how it really sets up for the balance of this decade, I think is something that people should take away from the call. I always smile a little bit whenever there's vaccine news because it seems to be overly pronounced impact on our stock, good or bad. And it always just makes me chuckle a little bit because of the strength of our business is really in our pharmaceutical medical device and consumer strength these days.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: And if I can jump in as well and just put in a commercial for our upcoming pharmaceutical business review. On November 18th, we're really looking forward to having a comprehensive overview of the business, our robust pipeline, our -- featuring our therapeutic area leaders and also really outlining our long-term growth outlook. So we're really excited. I think at that meeting, we're planning for a great day and we'll be highlighting a number not only our key therapeutic areas and delving deep in the pipelines, but also having a chance to feature a number of the key assets that folks, I know, have really, really interest in the learning more about. So everything from [Indiscernible], our BCMA CAR-T to nipocalimab that we got through our MOMENTA acquisition last year, Our new treatment for lung cancer, and what we hope will be expanding into a much broader market, RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. Our Retina portfolio. Also, things like our RSV vaccine, and our TARIS Drug Delivery platform for bladder cancer, and then, I could go on and on. But nonetheless, we're really planning for a very exciting day on November 18th and look forward to having you all join us.\nJoseph Wolk : That was a 60-second spot, Jennifer. Thibaut is going to tell you about the rates on that one, if you say. Jen.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: We're really looking forward to a great day. I couldn't pass on this opportunity to not highlight it. Thanks, Matt, for your question. Rob, last question please.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. I just had a quick question, a follow-up to Ashley on the Medical Device business, and I'm just curious, it feels like now there might be a little bit more uncertainty around the pace of recovery. I just want to be sure I'm getting that message correct. And you did mention that you didn't expect the hospital labor shortages to necessarily improve as we go through Q4, so I was just curious about how to reconcile that with the strong recovery. Thanks so much.\nAshley Mc Evoy : Thanks for the question, Danielle. I think what we're planning for quarter four is I think we'll still continue to see micro-surges in cases. There will always be little hot spots. Hospitals are still going to experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near-term immediately. I will qualify that so to say that they have been quite frankly masters at understanding how to manage patient flow and procedure flow. When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will continue to recover globally, similar to the trends we saw in quarter two where surgical procedures grew low single-digit above 2019 baselines.  As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the highly elective procedures like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as in terms of hospital capacity, at levels significantly above 2019 in the near-term. But I would just say going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data, to look at the worldwide hospitalization data and the freeing up of mobility restrictions. So we are encouraged by quarter [Indiscernible] performance from 2021 Q4 versus last year. You'll recall we ended around 1.5% Medical Devices did in revenue versus 2019. So we are anticipating a healthier recovery.\nJoseph Wolk : And Danielle, maybe just to clarify too. It's a recovery no matter what. It's just the intensity of the recovery so I would not expect, based on what we know today, any backward step with respect to Medical Devices performance going forward across the industry.\nJennifer Mc Intyre: Thanks, Danielle, for your question and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Our apologies to those we couldn't get to today because of time, but please don't hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks.\nJoseph Wolk : Great. Thanks, Jen. So I hope you take away from the third quarter results, as well as this call, just how broad our financial strength is. Setting us up very well to close out 2021. But more importantly, 2022 and beyond. We certainly do look forward to seeing many of you in New Brunswick on November 18th, where Jennifer McIntyre and a number of the pharmaceutical leaders will be featuring our product portfolio and just how optimistic we are about the future. With that, I'll close the call and wish everyone a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard us share we're experiencing a temporary setback in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun, I will tell you. It's highly complex, but sometimes we do experience technical challenges, but we are absolutely committed to resolving our challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive differentiated offering as soon as possible.  When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going to have to continue to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4 nor in 2022, but they've been quite master rolling how to manage patient flows. We are when I talk to hospital systems over the past three weeks and particularly in United States, they are ramping up again and resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patients sentiment, the cold weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3. Thanks, Jennifer. Bob, thanks for your question, Rob, next question, please. Thank you for the question, Matt. As Sarah shared in quarter 3, knees grew 2% versus 2020, and a lot of that was due to really two-folds. One is the state of innovation, so the VELYS knee robot is obviously getting some nice traction. As Joe shared earlier, the utilization rates are very encouraging from hospital systems that have adopted this new technology. That coupled with a very proven differentiated ATTUNE knee implant, with a revision offering, as well as the cementless rotating platform have all really helped [Indiscernible] up, I would say, our portfolio in knees.  And then you mentioned the channel and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We continue to be encouraged by our market share gains predominantly enjoined in ASC. And really we started to deploy what we call an advanced case management, which is really how you simplify the pre -op planning in ASC and that new advanced case management service is starting to really take effect. And we expect to have these new sites of care start to really improve not just in [Indiscernible], not just in the U.S., but even in areas of Europe and really moving joints to more of a day surgery. Thank you for the question. Yeah. So we're really proud of the role that our vaccine's playing and really helping address the global COVID pandemic throughout the world. And hopefully, you saw last week that the FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended a booster for our COVID vaccine. We are in the process right now of continuing under emergency use authorization to roll-out our vaccine across the globe in both in developed markets, as well as developing markets.  I think as the pandemic, as we continue to work through and fulfill our existing contracts that we have throughout the globe, and as we move into more of a booster market in later '22, potentially into 2023, we'd be looking at moving into a more of a commercial market. I know our R&D team is gearing up and getting ready to file for full approval. I think we want to be moving into a full approval market for that switchover to commercial. Thanks for the question, Danielle. I think what we're planning for quarter four is I think we'll still continue to see micro-surges in cases. There will always be little hot spots. Hospitals are still going to experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near-term immediately. I will qualify that so to say that they have been quite frankly masters at understanding how to manage patient flow and procedure flow. When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will continue to recover globally, similar to the trends we saw in quarter two where surgical procedures grew low single-digit above 2019 baselines.  As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the highly elective procedures like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as in terms of hospital capacity, at levels significantly above 2019 in the near-term. But I would just say going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data, to look at the worldwide hospitalization data and the freeing up of mobility restrictions. So we are encouraged by quarter [Indiscernible] performance from 2021 Q4 versus last year. You'll recall we ended around 1.5% Medical Devices did in revenue versus 2019. So we are anticipating a healthier recovery."

            "name": "Joseph Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflected continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses, and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies. How do we see the current medical device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August with the highest impacts consistently in those procedures deemed to be more elective, such as knees and spine.  Globally, new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the UK, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure volumes. We continue to believe these variables are more short-term in nature and the Medical Devices market remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have not changed due to COVID-19.  The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA HAFYERA, the first and only twice yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia, and we announced the start of a Phase 3 study of our investigational RSV vaccine in older adults. Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted [Indiscernible] drug designation for nipocalimab in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral nerves, characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes.  This represents nipocalimab 's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. However, we are stopping further investigation in the Fontan-palliated population of macitentan 10 milligram in pulmonary hypertension as results from the RUBATO Phase 3 trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit.  Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday the FDA 's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend emergency-use authorization for a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, at least 2 months following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical and real-world data showing that while a single-shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19.  We are very excited to share more about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business review on November 18th. In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions in the first half of 2021 by introducing the enhanced shoulder system in the third quarter, a first to market fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations.  We also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON Circular powered stapler is associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection. Let's transition to financials starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with a recently announced qualified settlement fund for current and future Talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final equitable resolution of all Talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent.  Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter representing final resolution of outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL. Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our MONARCH platform for lung bronchoscopy, and are well on our way to expanding MONARCH indications, including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer, and submitting an application to the FDA for MONARCH to be used in the treatment of kidney stones.  Our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S. has received several OUS approvals and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems place to date than we projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately two years from our earlier projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19 related disruptions, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries.  Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform and will provide updates to the external community as warranted. Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. Moving to our full-year 2021 guidance.  Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales consistent with our July guidance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13%, or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a midpoint of 12.7% or 93.1 billion.  As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 where $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion. Moving to other items of the P&L, consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year.  Given year-to-date trends, we are modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950 million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain one time favorable tax positions and settlements both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint. Well, not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share.  Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77 to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of employees around the globe, whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders.  We continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone everywhere, and I am grateful for their efforts and commitment. I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the increases last three years, and to observe and to learn from him both professionally and personally.  I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he shares the same commitment to patients, employees, and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be featured at the previously mentioned November 18th Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business and plans for the future. I am pleased our Worldwide Chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon, and Jennifer Taubert are here with me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre, from our Investor Relations team, will facilitate the Q&A portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A. Jen. Yes, Chris. So this is Joe Wolk. Let me answer some of it quantitatively and then maybe I'll hand it over to Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments. In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if you look at what I guess has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in two categories. The vaccine, quite frankly. And as you saw, we did not change the full-year guidance. So that is simply timing.  We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter and we're still very much committed to the 2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that. With respect to medical devices, I think we're very pleased that we had above 7% growth in the quarter, given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early next year, so that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022. But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on medical devices and then to Jennifer to discuss pharmaceuticals. Great. Thanks, Ashley and Jennifer and Chris, I know you asked about medical devices and pharmaceuticals. But to be complete, Thibaut I know you had great success in the quarter, 6%, almost 9% when you compare to Q3 of 2019, maybe give a little bit of an outlook as to what you're seeing for the balance of the year and into next? Great. Thanks, Thibaut. Jen, back to you. Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. Let me start this response by underscoring just our conviction in the safety based on decades of science that these products are safe. What we've done is acknowledge that there's an established process that allows companies facing abuse of toward systems to resolve claims in an efficient and equitable manner. We initiated this process specifically for our cosmetic talc claims, both for current and future. And while we believe the cases lack merit, and by the way, an overwhelming number of courts, juries, and judges who have opined on this to full adjudication ultimately agree with us.  We did establish a $2 billion qualified settlement fund. But as you note in your question Josh, it's really the bankruptcy courts that will ultimately decide this. It's not plaintiff's attorneys. It's not Johnson & Johnson. But we do know that based on prior experience precedent, that claimants are far better off and clarity and resolution is in the best interest of all stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the process, but we're really beholden to how the bankruptcy court decides to proceed and their timeline. Thanks, Louise, for the question. I'll try to address that one. What I would say is, first off, I'd probably repeat the words I had both to congratulate Alex, as well as Joaquin. Alex clearly on a stellar career, a great run as his tenure as CEO. And he'll be a very active Executive Chairman, I suspect. It's not as if he's riding completely off into the sunset. Joaquin values the same principles that have made Johnson & Johnson successful.  That's investing in innovation and making sure that we've got differentiated products and solutions to improve the standard of healthcare across the globe. The nice thing about the transition is, I don't expect any significant bumps. They've worked together for a number of years. The strategies that they have talked about and that you'll probably see in the early part of Joaquin 's tenure have been contemplated with Alex in mind and they've collaborated as Chair and Vice Chair over a number of years.  So I would expect as the organization does a very smooth transition. With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had on the scientific community not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HID, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And then just most recently his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again here at J&J but also on the global stage. I think the -- probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year is 23% higher through nine months than what it was last year, and last year was a record-setting year in terms of what we've invest in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to the success that they will continue to carry on that Paul has really, I guess, cemented in terms of how we approach our business. Matt, this is Joe. Thanks for raising the point because I do think that underscores in that question just the strength of our core business, right? So vaccines in and of itself this year is not for profit. As Jennifer said, we'll rely on the science and the data to guide us how we proceed commercially.  But you should all consider that as upside to our base plan. We're so proud of the results that we've been able to accomplish, the investment in R&D, and just the strength of the portfolio not just this year, but how it really sets up for the balance of this decade, I think is something that people should take away from the call. I always smile a little bit whenever there's vaccine news because it seems to be overly pronounced impact on our stock, good or bad. And it always just makes me chuckle a little bit because of the strength of our business is really in our pharmaceutical medical device and consumer strength these days. That was a 60-second spot, Jennifer. Thibaut is going to tell you about the rates on that one, if you say. Jen. And Danielle, maybe just to clarify too. It's a recovery no matter what. It's just the intensity of the recovery so I would not expect, based on what we know today, any backward step with respect to Medical Devices performance going forward across the industry. Great. Thanks, Jen. So I hope you take away from the third quarter results, as well as this call, just how broad our financial strength is. Setting us up very well to close out 2021. But more importantly, 2022 and beyond. We certainly do look forward to seeing many of you in New Brunswick on November 18th, where Jennifer McIntyre and a number of the pharmaceutical leaders will be featuring our product portfolio and just how optimistic we are about the future. With that, I'll close the call and wish everyone a great day."

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded.  If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nChris DelOrefice: Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the Second Quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  Also joining Joe and myself during the Q&A portion of the call will be Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceuticals, Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health, and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medical Devices.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson and Johnson web site at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.  Please note that today's presentation includes Forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results, to differ materially from those projected.  In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook, is a best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date.  A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures, utilized for today's discussion, to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.J&J.com.  Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments.  Joe will provide insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment, and will outline our updated guidance, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine for 2021. Then we will begin the Q&A session with each of the segment leaders providing a brief update on their respective businesses.  The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes.  Now, let's move to the second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 27.1% versus the second quarter of 2020.  Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 23% as currency had a positive impact of 4.1 points. In the U.S., sales increased 24.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 29.5%.  Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 20.9%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 8.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 23.8% worldwide, 25.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings.  For the quarter, net earnings were $6.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.35, versus diluted earnings per share of $1.36 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.48, representing increases of 49% and 48.5% respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2020.  On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44.9%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you.  Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and increased 9.2%, with increases in the U.S. of 12.4% and growth of 6.3% outside of the U.S.  Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 10%. Year-to-date adjusted operational growth was 3.3% and is more reflective of performance given the quarterly fluctuations of COVID-19 impacts.  The over-the-counter medicines grew 8.9% globally, driven by strong growth in ZYRTEC, due to both the timing of and increased incidents in the allergy season. Digestive Health grew double-digits driven by U.S. PEPCID, new SKU stocking in the Club Channel, coupled with share growth and increased COVID-19 related healthcare professional recommendations for the hydration benefit offering, ORSL, in the Asia Pacific region.  The skin health beauty franchise grew 12.9% globally, with the U.S. increasing 23% and OUS increasing 1.4%. Skin health beauty outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to divestitures.  Worldwide growth was driven by market recovery in key markets, increased U.S. stocking for new products, and comparisons to COVID -19 related destocking dynamics. NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance in the U.S., primarily due to market recovery, new product innovation, and higher stocking due to the NEUTROGENA rapid firming product launch, partially offset by competitive pressures. OGX and [Indiscernible] growth was driven by share gains and market growth in hair care.  Oral Care grew 2.5% globally due to strong OUS performance for LISTERINE, reflecting accelerated category and increased demand from continued successful promotional campaigns. Divestitures in the quarter, negatively impacted results by 310 basis points.  The Baby Care franchise grew by 5% as a result of market recovery and OUS strength in Johnson's and AVEENO Baby in eCommerce. Wound Care delivered strong growth of 13.4%, driven by U.S. market growth with increased consumer behaviors focused on preparedness and infection prevention, and seasonal stocking versus prior year COVID-19 destocking dynamics.  Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.6 billion grew 13.6%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 12.2% and OUS with sales increasing by 15.4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 14.1%. Global sales in the quarter included a $164 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine.  Additionally, as a reminder for comparison purposes, Q2 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 300 to 350 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above market levels.  Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 17%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 30.5% driven by increased market growth and share gains, with U.S. share increasing roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 8 points in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA was up 36.8% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to share gains, continued global expansion into new markets, and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020.  U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and nearly 3 points in psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with growth of 21.5%. DARZALEX continued its exceptional performance trajectory growing 53.8%, driven by share gains and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU.  DARZALEX continues to grow share across all lines of therapy, with nearly 4 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA also continued its global momentum with growth of 73.7% in the quarter, driven by market share, which increased by nearly 2 points across indications, and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication.  IMBRUVICA grew 12.5% globally due to volume gains driven by our market-leading share, but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. to novel oral competition and a market that remains slightly depressed due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio had strong double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular, metabolism, other declined 7.3% this quarter, driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 1.8% in XARELTO due to continued demand strength.  Lastly, our pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved growth of 8.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 11.9% and UPTRAVI growth of 9.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment.  Worldwide medical devices sales of $7 billion grew 57.2%, with the U.S. increasing 77.2% and OUS increasing 41.9%, primarily due to the recovery of procedures from COVID-19 restrictions that occurred in the second quarter of 2020, coupled with the success of recently launched products and commercial activities across the business.  Selling days had a minor positive impact on growth this quarter. We expect the full-year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, to be minimal. Given the extent of the procedure disruption from COVID-19 in 2020, I thought it may be helpful to provide context for our current quarter performance versus the second quarter of 2019.  Worldwide Medical Devices grew about 7% versus Q2 2019, with 8 of our 11 billion-dollar platforms showing growth versus 2019. The pace of market recovery in knees, spine, and vision-surgical, has been slower than the other markets in which we compete as these procedures are perceived to be more deferrable by patients.  Geographically, both the U.S. and Asia-Pacific markets surpassed Q2 2019. While EMEA and Latin America markets have been slower to recover, and Q2 results remained at or below 2019 levels. Looking at results for each of our platforms, Interventional Solutions delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 71.3% and strong double-digit growth versus the second quarter of 2019.  Electrophysiology reinforced our global market share leadership position growing 74.4%, driven by recovery in the market coupled with our market expansion activities, the strength of our broad-based portfolio, and new products.  Worldwide orthopaedics delivered 48.6% growth versus the prior year, driven primarily by market recovery and success of newer product launches. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 24.8%, reflecting market recovery, strength of our comprehensive portfolio, and success of newer product introductions.  This quarter, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of products with the launch of a next-generation Variable Angle Clavicle Plate System designed to enhance plate to bone fit on a broad range of patients and simplify implant selection for the surgeon.  And we launched an advanced tibial nailing system, designed to provide a more stable implant solution and create efficiency within the healthcare system by streamlining instrumentation across our portfolio.  Worldwide hips grew 68.1% this quarter, driven by market recovery, our continued leadership position in the anterior approach, demand for the ACTIS Stem, aided by our other enabling technologies, such as VELYS Hip Navigation and innovative commercial programs focused on expanding coverage and access for hip fracture patients in parts of Europe and Latin America.  Knees returned to growth this quarter, increasing 94.6% globally, primarily due to market recovery. Results reflect continued COVID-19 challenges and the related impact on procedures in markets like India, Japan, and Australia, and other dynamics, including faster recovery trends in primary knee procedures compared to revisions.  This quarter, we began commercialization of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS Digital Solutions and ATTUNE knee platform, including the second half 2021 launch of ATTUNE Cementless Fixed Bearing Knee with AFFIXIUM 3D Printed Technology, will enhance our portfolio and competitiveness as procedures continue to recover.  Spine returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 51.7%, reflecting market recovery and positive impact from recently launched products, SYMFONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT, as well as strategic partnerships which further enhance our offerings, such as the X-Pac Expandable Cage.  Advanced Surgery grew 44.3% versus prior - year. In addition to the positive impact of procedure recovery, Biosurgery delivered sales growth of 48% and positive share momentum driven by new products and commercial strategies to expand market penetration and adoption. Endocutters and Energy both grew around 40% globally, primarily due to procedure recovery, new product introductions, and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion activities, partially offset by competitive pressure in the U.S.  We also achieved a significant milestone within the quarter with our Monarch robotic platform, surpassing a 100 customers and 8,000 procedures. General surgery grew 67.8% globally, with Wound Closure growing 50.1% globally, driven by recovery in the markets, continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including our Plus sutures and STRATAFIX Barb suture family, and a change in channel inventory levels in the U.S., contributing about 6 points to global growth.  Global General Surgery sales were positively impacted by 23 points due to a prior-year unfavorable pricing adjustment in the U.S., we communicated last year. Worldwide Vision grew 66% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery. U.S. Contact Lens growth of 73.6% reflects the strength of our market-leading ACUVUE Portfolio.  Commercial initiatives, such as our Prioritize Your Eyes campaign, launched to raise awareness around the importance of routine screenings, new products, including early success from ACUVUE Multifocal, and an inventory build contributing about 5 points. Growth outside the U.S. of 43.1% reflects market recovery and strength of ACUVUE 1-DAY, and recent Asia-Pacific ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH Beauty launch.  Global Surgical Vision delivered growth of a 115.8%, driven by market recovery and positive momentum related to new products like TECNIS Eyhance, TECNIS Synergy, which both launched this year in the U.S. market, and VERITAS, our next-generation phacoemulsification device.  Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the Second Quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.48 reflects a reported increase of 48.5% and an operational increase of 44.9%.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved by 340 basis points, primarily driven by the recovery in Medical Device from prior-year COVID-19 related inventory impacts and fixed cost deleveraging.  Selling, marketing, and administrative margins improved 110 basis points due to the recovery of Medical Device sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 14.6% of sales this quarter.  The $3.4 billion investment was a 25% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. The Other Income and Expense Line showed Net income of $488 million in the Second Quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of 24 million in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced litigation-related items, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on securities.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate declined from 8% in the second quarter of 2020 to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by a one-time tax benefit the Company recognized in the second quarter 2021, resulting from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded additional tax benefits related to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform, which benefited the 2020 tax rate.  Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 14.8% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for additional details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment.  In the second quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 29.1% to 33.4%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment.  Medical Devices margin improved from 1.2% to 28.6% driven primarily by overall expense leveraging, resulting from the COVID-19 related sales recovery. Consumer health margins improved by 380 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies, including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program, partially offset by increased investments in brand marketing expenses.  Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 450 basis points, primarily driven by increased research and development investment, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine net costs, and general portfolio progression. Moving to important developments, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter.  I'll highlight a few, starting with our Pharmaceutical business. We continue to make positive progress advancing our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and therapies. As we've shared previously, we are rigorous and focusing on differentiated, transformational medical innovation.  In the quarter, we announced our decision not to continue the collaboration and license agreement for Cusatuzumab, an investigational therapeutic antibody that targets CD70. The decision is based upon Janssen's review of all available data and in consideration of the evolving standard of care for the treatment of AML.  We received EU approval for PONVORY in relapsing multiple sclerosis, and also U.S. approval of RYBREVANT for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor Exon 20 Insertion Mutations.  In addition, we completed our EU filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third NME approval this year.  Within our Medical Device portfolio, we continue to make meaningful advancements in our innovation pipeline, launching 17 major first-country launches in the first half of 2021, including 8 products this quarter. As noted earlier, we received FDA approval and launched TECNIS Synergy and TECNIS Synergy Toric II intraocular lenses in the U.S.  These are next-generation presbyopia correcting lenses, and deliver the widest range of continuous vision, and the best near vision among leading PC IOLs. Finally, within the surgery business, the ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue S sealer launched in the U.S., expanding the Ethicon advanced bipolar energy portfolio.  That concludes the sales P&L and pipeline highlights for Johnson & Johnson 's Second Quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\nJoseph Wolk: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter, and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone is having a safe, healthy, and enjoyable summer.  As Chris referenced, Johnson & Johnson 's businesses remain leaders, or are better positioned, within the markets in which they compete. While the pandemic makes it difficult to reliably gauge what results will be in any given quarter, you likely noticed that all three segments beat your expectations.  We continue to be poised for further growth and value creation not just in 2021, but more importantly for 2022 and beyond. Over the past 18 months, our people have been a driving force behind our success. And guided by our credo, they have demonstrated resilience and agility while remaining committed to ensuring our life-saving medicines and products reach patients and consumers around the world.  Thanks to the efforts of our 136,000 colleagues across the world, Johnson & Johnson continues to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere. Foundational to any healthy business is a focus and commitment to broader stakeholder stewardship.  We are proud to share the progress we are making in a transparent and accountable manner. A few weeks ago, we held our annual ESG Investor Update following the publication of our 2020 Health for Humanity report and our 2025 goals. Through these goals, we aim to deliver even greater long-term value to our broad set of stakeholders.  I hope you had the opportunity to view this webcast. If you have not, the replay is still available on the Johnson & Johnson website. Let's get into the results with an update on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow, with approximately $8 billion year-to-date.  We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt, resulting in $8 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way that will benefit stakeholders over the long term.  Our dividend remains a key priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.8 billion to shareholders. Regarding M&A, we continually evaluate strategic opportunities that have the potential to further enhance our business, while also driving better health outcomes for patients and consumers.  Since Chris covered highlights from our second quarter performance and our worldwide shares will provide sector-specific commentary to open the Q&A session. I will now move directly to providing the update to our full-year 2021 guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance.  For clarity, I will first comment on our core business revenue and then remark on our anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which is now included in our enterprise guidance. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect our base business defined as excluding our COVID-19 vaccine to remain strong.  Based on this confidence, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 9.5% to 10.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance.  We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, which accounts for previously completed divestitures in Medical Devices, Consumer Health, as well as within other oncology in Pharmaceuticals, resulting in an operational sales range of 9% to 10%, or $90 billion to $90.8 billion for a midpoint of 9.5% or $90.4 billion.  While we don't predict currency movements, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.18, and in consideration of other currency movements, there is no change from our previous estimates, resulting in favorable currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points.  This results in estimated reported sales in the range of $91.3 billion to $92.1 billion, an increase of 10.5% to 11.5%, or 11% at the midpoint versus 2020. Now, a few words on the expected contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine to our updated full-year 2021 guidance.  Our goal has always been to bring forth our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. We are proud to have been part of the unprecedented collaboration in the healthcare industry that has led to a number of authorized vaccines in the marketplace.  Chris shared earlier that we recorded vaccine revenue in the quarter. Specifically, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed a $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $264 million. At this point, revenue from the first half of the year was provisionally recorded at $5 per dose, given that volumes during the pandemic period were uncertain. Currently, we expect the ultimate final not-for-profit price could be as much as $8 per dose.  The final not-for-profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net cost incurred, as well as, volumes produced during the pandemic period. Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advanced purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter.  Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include 10 manufacturing sites for various stages of production. On July 2nd, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approved an expansion of our facility in the Netherlands increasing our capacity to produce active drug substance.  The FDA also released 5 batches of drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility under the Emergency Use Authorization, and we continue to work with health authorities on the approval of additional drug substance manufactured at Emergent.  Now, I do appreciate that many of you are understandably looking beyond 2021-2022. It is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine, given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variance. But as recent published clinical data indicates, our vaccine appears to have durability for at least eight months and is effective against the recent Delta variant and other highly prevalent viral variance.  At this time, I'd caution you to wait to include future-year vaccine projections in your models for our business. The COVID-19 vaccine market will continue to evolve, and we look forward to sharing additional details as more data become available, including the role our vaccine will play for you to forecast future years.  Given this and what I already provided on our base business, our new updated guidance expectations are reflected on this slide, reflecting an enterprise total revenue of $94.2 billion at the midpoint. Moving to other items of the P&L. We are now expecting our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year, slightly less than our prior guidance as we continue to invest for the long term.  We are increasing our other income estimate to a range of $800 million to $900 million. This increase is primarily attributable to increased investment returns related to our employee benefit programs. As a reminder, pension service costs are recorded in operating expenses, while any investment performance related to our employee benefit programs are recorded in other income net expense.  Moving to interest expense. Based on our year-to-date experience, we are lowering our estimate to a range of 100 million to 200 million. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 16.0% to 17.0% based on certain one-time benefits realized in the first half of the year. The results of these updates translate to increasing our earnings guidance.  We are also tightening the guidance range. The new adjusted operational per share guidance range is 18.4% to 19.6%, or $9.50 to $9.60, with a midpoint of 19% or $9.55 per share. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, we expect a slight change from what we communicated on the Q1 earnings call.  Currency will now impact EPS by 1.2% or $0.10 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.60 to $9.70 or a midpoint of $9.65, increasing 20.2%. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue.  I am now pleased and want to thank our worldwide shares, Jennifer Taubert, Thibaut Mongon, and Ashley McEvoy, for their participation in the Q&A portion of our call today. I know this audience values having these leaders on earnings calls from time-to-time.  Before we jump into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to ask Jennifer, Thibaut, and Ashley, each to provide a brief business segment update and qualitative outlook for the remainder of 2021. Jennifer, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment.\nJennifer Taubert: Well, thank you, Joe, and hello everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. I'd like to start by thanking my Janssen colleagues around the world for their relentless focus on delivering for patients. As a result, I'm proud to share that our Pharmaceutical sector had another strong quarter of above-market growth.  As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business delivered $12.6 billion in worldwide sales in the second quarter, with adjusted operational growth of approximately 14%. Our base business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated robust growth at 12.6%. This is our third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $12 billion, and our growth was broadly based across geographic regions and our therapeutic area.  We continue to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio, delivering double-digit growth for 9 key brands, including our oncology medicines, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, and ERLEADA, our immunology medicines, TREMFYA and STELARA, our pulmonary hypertension medicines, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, and INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in our neuroscience portfolio.  Our leading commercial and market access capabilities enabled increased market penetration and share gains across our key promoted brands. And as we shared in our transparency report this year, our growth continues to come from volume gains and not price.  This is a strong indication that our life-changing medicines are reaching more patients each day worldwide. It's important to note, we continue to be a trough investor in research and development. This investment fuels our pipeline and builds the foundation for our long-term growth.  During the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our pipeline of transformational medicines. I'll highlight just a few of the key milestones and achievements. First, in May, the FDA approved amivantamab now known as RYBREVANT. This is the first by-specific antibody approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.  This is our first approved treatment for lung cancer, which we hope will be an important area for us going forward. This is our second NME approval of this year. PONVORY, or ponesimod, was our first 2021 NME approval, and this was by the FDA in March, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the second quarter, it was also approved by the European Commission and Health Canada.  We also advanced our BCMA CAR-T cell therapy program, Cilta-Cel, for patients with multiple myeloma. In the second quarter, the U.S. FDA granted our BCMA CAR-T priority review. A marketing authorization was filed with the European Medicines Agency, and submission was made to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency.  We anticipate FDA approval of Cilta-Cel as our third NME approval later this year. In addition, our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX continues to benefit an increasing number of patients. In the second quarter, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for 2 additional patient populations; as combination therapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis, which is the first and only approved therapy for this rare and life-threatening blood disorder; and as combination therapy for adults with pretreated multiple myeloma.  Additionally, subsequent to the quarter, the FDA -approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, our sixth indication specific to our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX. I'm proud of our Pharmaceutical results in the second quarter and feel confident in our ability to make 2021 our tenth consecutive year of above-market growth.  Our outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. Before I close, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Pharmaceuticals business review on November 18. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive overview of our business, our robust pipeline, and our long-term growth outlook.  We'll cover our key therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology, which are always areas of high interest, and we'll delve deeper into some of our newer areas, including our retina and gene therapy pipeline, and the details behind the breadth of our auto antibody program that came through our acquisition of MOMENTA last year.  I hope you'll be able to join us. So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today. Thibaut, I will now turn it over to you.\nThibaut Mongon: Alright. Thank you, Jennifer. And good morning to all of you on the call. I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year we focused on execution across our broad-based portfolio, delivered solid results, growing 3% operationally. And this year, we continue to demonstrate a strong level of performance.  The strategy we set a couple of years ago for the Consumer Health segment to be focused on personal health with science-based, professionally endorsed brands, and advancing our digital capabilities, continues to strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers worldwide, resulting in strong quarterly results and solid year-to-date performance.  Our Consumer Health sector grew 9.2% operationally in the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted operational growth for Acquisitions and Divestitures was 10% in the quarter and 3.3% on a year-to-date basis.  And as Chris stated in his remarks, these year-to-date results are a better representation of our performance given the fluctuations we've seen in the market due to COVID-19 dynamics and seasonality overall. We saw strong year-to-date performance for brands in our two strongholds such as ZYRTEC, PEPCID, and NICORETTE in OTC, or AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, and OGX in Skin Health.  In our specialty areas, brands like LISTERINE, AVEENO Baby, and BAND-AID also contributed nicely to our year-to-date results. And from a geographic perspective, we are encouraged to see that we grew across all regions in the quarter. Now, if we look into the future, even if we will continue to see variability in categories depending on seasonality and local market conditions, we are confident that our strategy is working.  We have the right portfolio to continue to deliver solid results; well balanced, both in terms of categories we compete in, and in terms of geographic presence. And lastly, we have been able to achieve our solid sales results while simultaneously improving our margin profile. Our efforts on end-to-end profitability improvement, including portfolio optimization and network improvements, have delivered to plan.  Our year-to-date adjusted IBT is approximately 27%, or another 250 basis point improvement over last year. We have made great strides in increasing our profitability to become a leader within our peer set.  And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve our margin profile, while at the same time investing to grow the topline, launching new products, and Chris referenced some of them in his remarks, and managing through anticipated higher commodity and distribution costs in the back half of 2021.  So in a nutshell, Consumer Health delivered a strong quarter and a solid first half. Our strategy is working and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the categories and market in which we compete. And now, let me hand over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley?\nAshley McEvoy: Thank you. Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning. Thanks for joining. Let me just begin with across JNJ, how privileged we feel to work in healthcare because we recognize that what we do matters, especially now. We're united by our purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of Health for Humanity and we're propelled by our MedTech aspiration to re-imagine the future of health today, in three ways. One is innovating across the continuum of patient care, two is prioritizing and modernizing health, and three is promoting health equity and wellness.  We continue to see strong evidence that our focus and actions to impact human health and improve our competitiveness is working. This quarter, MedTech delivered sales of $7 billion, representing adjusted operational growth of 59% versus 2020 and, as Chris mentioned, up 7% versus 2019, bringing our first half of 2021 revenue performance to just over 5% compared to 2019. Our sales reflect market recovery and our positive competitive momentum.  Eight of our $11 billion MedTech platforms grew versus the second quarter 2019. And quarter one '21 share trends show, that we have maintained or gained share in ten of these platforms. We have an exciting pipeline, and we've achieved some truly amazing results in the first half of this year which position us well to continue our growth momentum. We've launched 17 major products in the first half of 2021. This is the highest number of first-half of the year launches in 5 years for our business. These include products which will strengthen our core like TECNIS SYNERGY, our most advanced premier intraocular lens in surgical vision; and the ENSEAL X1 Curved Tissue Sealer, a next-generation advanced energy solution in our surgery franchise. We continue to focus on significant global health concerns, including myopia management, where we plan to have a portfolio of solutions for patients. And we are progressing all things digital with solutions covering the entire paradigm of care, including open and laparoscopic procedures, orthopedics, and illuminal, interventional and vision. Our Monarch platform achieved a significant milestone reaching over 100 customers and enabling over 8000 bronchoscopies, which is life-changing, and potentially life-saving, in the detection and treatment of lung cancer. VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee procedures, launched in the United States and received regulatory approval in Australia this month. We're extremely pleased with the early customer engagement and feedback confirming the differentiation of this next-generation solution. And Ottava, our soft tissue digital surgery offering, continues to progress its key development milestones. We also recognize that the digitization of healthcare is happening and rapidly accelerating technology like this, making it possible to deliver new ways of care. An example of this is from our innovative team in China to develop the virtual solution powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to more effectively train and expand the number of highly skilled electrophysiologists and provide broader access to high-quality care. Learning curves went from novice to experts from a year to 4 months. In the first 4 months of launch, 150 newly trained physicians delivered care to 7500 patients. It's no surprise our Electrophysiology business in China is so strong. And we continue to leverage science to influence industry trends and positively impact patient outcomes and human health. Just this month, the UK modified their NICE guidelines to recommend the use of PLUS SUTURES as a standard of care, giving the evidence supporting their role in reducing surgical site infections and are necessary cost to the healthcare system. Regarding the pandemic, we are seeing light at the end of COVID-19 tunnel, but this remains, as we all know, a very fluid situation. The pace of continued recovery will depend on multiple factors, including the speed at which global populations are vaccinated, healthcare capacity, and the ability to manage through surges, as well as the rate at which patients seek treatment. In closing, and I'd like to emphasize that our strong quarter 2 results and continuing momentum can be attributed to our purpose-driven, globally diverse team, which embody a winning spirit every day. Their resilience, agility, and creativity have taken us to the next level in our business, build stronger relationships with our customers and patients, and defined a clear vision of our future. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thank you, Jennifer, thanks, Thibaut and thanks, Ashley. Let's now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instruction]. Please limit your questions to one question only. Your first question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for taking my question. My question is about the global surge in COVID. There has been a surge despite high rates of vaccinations in many places in the world. So just curious, how do you think this could impact your business in the second half '21 if it continues to get worse? Thank you.\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. Thanks for the question, Louise. I think it's probably best maybe that you hear from both Ashley and Jennifer on this specific perspective. Ashley?\nAshley McEvoy: Yeah, Louise. I would say -- listen, we're encouraged by, quite frankly, several things. How -- the ability that hospitals can manage through capacity in surges and labor, as well as, obviously, the vaccination efforts around the world. And just the patient, there's a significant backlog of care. If I look at the UK, my goodness, there's like 5,000,000 patients waiting for medical interventions, 400,000 of those folks waiting for surgery for the past 12 months. But as we know, it's not going to be linear. We do know hospital systems in the United States are starting to delay care right now. I think quarter-to-quarter, it will improve, but it will never be a linear line.\nJennifer Taubert: I can add in. On the Pharma side, most of our core categories are pretty much back to the pre-COVID level, the exception on that actually being CLL. But we're really seeing strength coming back, for example, in the United States and in Europe. And we do anticipate some modest ups and downs, but I think our team really did an extraordinary job last year of partnering with healthcare systems, and physicians, and patients to make sure that they could get on and stay on the therapies that they need. So our outlook for the rest of the year really remains strong for our sector, regardless of what happens with emerging variants and any continued blips as it relates to COVID.\nJoseph Wolk: I'd also add, Louise, that I think we've got to really tip our cap to the healthcare administrators, health professionals across the globe. We're in a much better position to handle a pandemic than we were of March of last year. And so, certainly, that would have, I would say, a favorable impact on whatever unfavorable events may occur. We really need to recognize just the great resiliency and agility that those individuals have shown as well.\nChris DelOrefice: Thibaut, do you want to share a little bit about consumer and the momentum you see there, and maybe a couple of the category dynamics as well?\nThibaut Mongon: Now, we see strong momentum across our broad-based portfolio as I told you earlier this morning, Our categories will continue to be impacted by market level conditions, seasonality. Having said that, we have proven, over the past 18 months, is that our broad-based portfolio, in terms of both categories and geographies, allowed us to weather whatever external conditions happen. And we expect continued momentum into the back half of the year.\nChris DelOrefice: Great, terrific. Thanks, Louise. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, just a finer point on the quarter-over-quarter improvement in device, as you mentioned. Do you expect the continued acceleration relative to 2019 in Q3 and Q4? And Joe, could you just help us think about the operational ex - COVID vaccine sales in EPS cadence in the second half, given the easier comp in Q3 and the extra week in Q4 2020? Thanks for taking the questions.\nAshley McEvoy: Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. I think what you heard is, in quarter 2 we were up about 7% relative to 2019, and that was pretty broad based. I'd say 3 out of 4 of our franchises posted growth versus 2019. Orthopedics was down about a point. We were up in the United States about a point. Down about 3 points in orthopedics in OUS in quarter 2, really due to some of the slower moving countries like Japan and India in opening up in COVID. When I think about quarter 3 and quarter 4, I do expect continued momentum. You'll recall last year, we were down about 3% in quarter 3 versus 2019, and we were down about 1.5% in quarter 4 2020 versus '19. I do expect continued progress. I expect Orthopedics to go positive. I expect Vision to accelerate, given a lot of the new product launches. As we've discussed, we think the category is going to be high double-digit. We expect to be more in the high single-digit at the end of this year versus 2019.\nJoseph Wolk: Yeah. And Larry, with respect to your question on guidance overall, I think I'd almost have to mirror a little bit what Ashley had said, the comparables were going to be most pronounced for the second quarter. There will be a little bit of benefit as we look into the third and fourth quarter. As you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter. But I really looking at the underlying strength of each of our businesses, improved share in the markets in which we lead and for those that which we don't lead. In addition to the -- what you heard from all 3 of our segment leaders, just an improved cadence of innovation; new approvals, new offerings that offer better healthcare solutions. That's how we're thinking about it. From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top-line growth, and EPS growth, that will approach 20%. We think that's very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised to the upside as well. We want to make sure that we don't only deliver strong results in the current quarter or the next 2 quarters, but really in the middle and back half of this decade as well. We think we're very well-positioned to do that.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I guess my question is just on the core revenue growth guidance. I think you've raised it twice this year. I'm just looking for a little bit more color of what's driving the upside versus your expectation? Is this more device versus pharma or consumer? Is it share gain versus overall market growth? Other geographies there standing out? I'm just trying to get a sense of like really what would've been the real upsides versus your initial expectations? If I can just slip a second quick one in, I think you mentioned the Pharma margins were impacted by increased investments in 2Q. Should we be thinking about that as a one-time event with the COVID vaccine expenses, et cetera, or are we entering kind of a sustained period of R&D ramp here or where we could see with some of those margins under pressure? Thank you.\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. Chris, let me take a stab at that and maybe, Jennifer, you can chime in with anything that I might have missed. But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say, coming into the year, just like every other Company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold; would there be new variants? And so we took a, what I thought was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations at the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year. What we did learn, and it really is a credit to the leaders that you've heard from today and their teams, just how important it is reaching out to customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how it was impacting the businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some, I'll call it a goodwill factor, with respect to how we're approaching our business today. With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing, and really what we all take great pride in is there's not one big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again, across all three segments that really positions us well. Last year, you might recall we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels. Even with all the questions and uncertainty, and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. We're actually at a pace this year through 6 months, about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a 6 month comparator. So we feel very well-positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion, we think we're hitting the mark across all aspects. I don't know, Jennifer, if there's anything else you want to add.\nJennifer Taubert: What I'd add in, we really focused on being a transformational medical innovator and we know that we do disproportionately invest in R&D versus the other areas of our business. If you take a look at the strength of our pipeline as well as the continued progression, we are seeing more assets transitioning into those later stages of development that require additional costs. And as Joe had indicated earlier, the beauty right now of the strength that we have for the business is it's allowing us to invest for those future waves of innovation. We feel real good about the level of investment for R&D in the Pharm group.\nJoseph Wolk: And just so nobody has a takeaway we're only investing in pharmaceuticals, we're investing in digital surgery capabilities that Ashley mentioned, we're investing in the consumer space, connecting with the consumer in more digital enabled ways. So it's really across the board.\nChris DelOrefice: Yeah, Chris, and I would just add. I guess on the Medical Device side, actually alluded to the amount of innovation we've seen in the quarter. So I think some of the strength you're seeing on the top line is clearly the result of the focus on bringing strong innovation to market. We're well-poised over a two-year period to deliver nearly 40, what we will call major new product launches, which is significant increase from where we've been. I think you're seeing that coupled with the recovery in MD results and then clearly in Pharm. Double-digit growth year-to-date, strong above-market performance. I think those investments are paying off, and focus on innovation will be a core focus of ours. Thanks for the question, Chris. Rob, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thank you very much. Just a quick one for me. For MedTech, thank you for giving that 7% number versus 2019. I was just curious, is that a reported number or is that a number that adjusts for currency? And then one other thing I'd love a quick comment on is on the COVID -tied questions. Just curious, especially on the the Device side, Ashley, is there a major geography right now where increasing levels of hospitalization have you particularly concerned or are we not quite at that stage yet?\nChris DelOrefice: I guess, first real quick, Bob. The 7% is an adjusted OPS growth number. Just for consistency, so you understand underlying organic.\nAshley McEvoy: Yeah. And Bob, just to -- again, thanks for the question. Again, we've had the benefit to learn from how this virus manifests around the world, starting with China. Asia is a region that is above 2019 in terms of procedure volume, clearly really driven by China. We've seen that Japan 's in lockdown. We know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently. We know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been -- which has been at a slower pace than the United States. We actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA, with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations and quite frankly, the backlog of patients that really need to be cared for. As I mentioned, I share a little bit of the waiting list data in the U.K.. And then U.S. in quarter 2 has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down. Medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May that went positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line, given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the U.S., like Florida, like Michigan in the midwest. So, again, I think our systems are unbelievably equipped to manage through this. I have huge respect and admiration for a lot of our customers who are managing COVID as well as non-COVID patients.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, I was hoping to just -- as we're thinking about 2022 and you are encouraging the street to exclude COVID vaccine revenues from our forecast. I was hoping just to better understand the COVID-19 vaccine margin impact in 2021. It seems to be margin dilutive, but how we should be thinking about the core businesses margin for a baseline for a great 2022 forecast.\nJoseph Wolk: Yeah. Josh, I would say at this point, it's really a minimal, in terms of both the segment, as well as, certainly Johnson & Johnson 's margin profile. Thus far through 6 months, it's been dilutive, again, to a minimal amount. We expect that dilution to reverse itself in the second half of this year. But again, being a not-for-profit, there's no material impact on EPS despite the 2.5 billion revenue estimate that we've provided earlier today.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Josh. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please?\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nTerrence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess the first one is just on the duration of protection with the vaccines. Joe, you touched on this a little bit. But maybe just, what's your perspective on how often a booster might be required here, and then can you remind us the timing of your 2-dose Phase 3 trial? And then Jennifer, would love any more details you could provide on the DARZALEX subcu-conversion and the IMBRUVICA competitor dynamics that you mentioned. Thank you.\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. Terrence, thanks for the questions. I would say in terms of the booster, whether it's needed or not, I think we should really defer to health officials around the world as to what that call will be. We do like the durability of at least 8 months. For our vaccine, we think that's better than some of the other vaccines that are out there, not to disparage them in any manner whatsoever, but health official still have not made any type of decisions on when or if a booster will be needed, so we'll just defer to them when more data is collected.\nJennifer Taubert: Perfect. So then, as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX, we saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter. Also, the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through, and our 6th indication specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business, already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form, and that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the U.S. And so very, very rapid adoption as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. We're very, very confident in the uptake and this is really providing significant benefits from patients going from multiple-hour infusions down to a 3-5 minute injection. A lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, a 22% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously less than that in the U.S.. In the U.S., we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patients starts are still down a little bit and CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so we did see a slower growth rate, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter. but we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains a number 1 prescribed treatment in CLL, and Relapsed/Refractory MCL, and also Waldenstrom. It's a number one BTKI wherever they are prescribed. It's also the only agent that's got demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL, and a safety profile that's supported by over 5 years of follow-up in clinical experience. We believe we've got a great profile that stands up competitively with IMBRUVICA and will continue to be able to deliver great growth for us going forward.\nJoseph Wolk: And Terrence, with respect to your question on the 2-dose study for the vaccine, we would expect that data to be late Q3, early Q4 at this point.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Terence, appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, thanks so much for taking our question. Just one -- just quick follow-up. I know that there were some questions early on on the tone of the market and COVID and trends for the back half of the year. But just to clarify, specifically for Ashley, the third quarter, for those businesses that are in the past, the Med Device businesses that have been seasonally off, down slightly, flattish from Q2 to Q3. Is that the pattern when you talk about improving momentum? And is that the pattern we should see a normal seasonal pattern or is the momentum you're describing something that would actually take this -- some of those businesses up sequentially? And I have one follow-up if I could.\nAshley McEvoy: Yeah, Matt. I think -- thank you for the question. I would tell you that what we've experienced is maybe some bookends like our Electrophysiology business, our AFib, treating cardiac ablation has recovered very expeditiously. And that team right now is just really working on refilling the patient funnel. At the other bookend, I would say would be cataract surgeries, which are -- procedure volumes are still below 2019. We would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace. It's really the pace of vaccinations, pace at hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged, healthy workforce and manage through some of the surges that we're seeing right now in the U.S. and other pockets of the world. And then just really patients sentiment. There's been a lot of investment that JNJ has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts, and data, and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seek ed care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear line. I keep saying that because we learn every week, we take four steps forward and maybe a step back. Thank you.\nMatt Miksic: Super. And then just one on Vision if I could. You mentioned the approval of Synergy in the U.S. I know it's been out. This is the presbyopia correcting IOL that's been out for a while in Europe. Just wondering if you can tell us what that has done for the European business, what the response has been, and how you're thinking about that mapping over to the U.S.? Thanks.\nAshley McEvoy: Sure. We've seen really strong performance of the TECNIS Synergy in EMEA. We are growing market share in EMEA in vision surgery and that market's had a lot of available premium intraocular lenses. We're pleased to bring that technology to the United States. We just launched in quarter 2, there's been very good pickup. It's also complemented, as Chris was mentioning, with our first innovation in the phacoemulsifier, the VERITAS. So the combination of those 2 with really our first advancement in Monofocals and the TECNIS Eyhance, which just launched earlier in quarter 1, the combination of those 3 innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the U.S. Surgical Vision. And as you heard in quarter 2, we did grow revenue versus 2019 in OUS. And so I expect that that should get -- have the U.S. start to pick up more in the back half of the year.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks, Ashley. Appreciate it.\nChris DelOrefice: Matt, thanks for the question. Rob, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. Two of them. One, could you sort of give us a little bit of update and color on the ORTHOTAXY adoption. You did provide some statistics on MONARCH, but anything else that you can sort of add in that bucket? And then my second question is, I might be reading the tea leaves a little bit here, but you sounded maybe just a little bit stronger on the idea or concept of M&A. Am I interpreting that correctly?\nAshley McEvoy: Thanks, Joanne. I'll start and then I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a bit about M&A and some of the other businesses as well. I would say we were very encouraged. We've had about 750 on-hand demonstrations with our VELYS knee digital surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things.  The value of the system, smaller footprint, the image's interoperative capabilities, and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams, the workflows, reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offering. It's new. We just got approval also in Australia, so we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that were assessing and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes, so stay tuned on that. And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say for MedTech point of view. You're seeing, we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A, really behind getting into iHealth. Getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it standard of care changing technology. It's like new ways in ablation. For liver ablation was the first indication. Right now we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our endoluminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors -- bleeding tumor cells. We're also in first-in-human in oncolytic viruses and drug delivery using Monarch. As well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter 2 relative to 2019. Again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down to. But I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a little bit about M&A.\nJennifer Taubert: One of the things that helps us be really successful here is that we're truly agnostic to the source of innovation. So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It' not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. So for example, late last year, we brought in [Indiscernible] we made the acquisition of MOMENTA, we brought in TARIS as a drug delivery device for bladder, a gene therapy for geographic atrophy and age-related macular degeneration from Hemera. And so we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technologies in our key areas of focus. And many times that's coming from our internal labs. Many times it's also coming externally. Our strategy and interest there remains the same and making sure that we've got the best innovation for patients going forward. I feel like we're doing a really good job on that front.\nThibaut Mongon: And in Consumer Health, I would say that we have a very strong portfolio of iconic brands that we continue to develop very quickly. Mostly, we continuously scan the market for opportunities to find either new go-to-market models or close gaps in our portfolio. But if you look at the acquisitions we have made over the past couple of years, we are really pleased with their performance. All of them, whether it's in self-care or skin health, are performing well. And that's very encouraging for the future.\nJoseph Wolk: And, Joanne, I'll just say you're going to force me to review the transcripts in maybe more detail than I usually do. I didn't think our language changed much. We always remain pretty aggressive when it comes to rigorous portfolio management; making sure that we're making the most of the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities that we have, and we just got to find deals that really fit the financial construct in a disciplined way. Whether it's in MedTech, Pharmaceuticals, or Consumer, we look across the board really monthly, if not more often, at opportunities that may fit nicely within the Johnson & Johnson business.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Operator, last question, please.\nOperator: Yes. That question will be coming from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nJayson Bedford: Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. Two unrelated questions that require, I think, quick answers. I'll ask both upfront. First, on the potential knock-on impact of the vaccine, I appreciate the not-for-profit nature of the product. But do you expect to see a halo effect, meaning do you think the vaccine will help pull through or benefit other areas of the portfolio? And then my second question, maybe for Thibaut. At 28%, how much further can consumer margins go? And then any further commentary on the inflationary pressures that you alluded to in the commentary? Thanks.\nJennifer Taubert: I'll jump in on the vaccine question first. Really, we're really proud of what we've been able to do in bringing forward a COVID vaccine. And we see this as, really, the start of what will become a vibrant vaccine business for Johnson & Johnson. You were talking about the halo effect or a knock-on effect. We believe the good that we're doing in the world, and that we will continue to be doing on the COVID vaccine, is a great start. And in our pipeline right now, we've got a number of vaccines in development that we hope to have positive results coming from, including an RSV vaccine, an HIV vaccine, one for prevention of sepsis and others that we're looking at. We hope this to be a start of what will become a very vibrant vaccine business for us over time.\nThibaut Mongon: Yeah. And to your question on consumer. As I said, we have seen the first half, and we continue to expect into the back half of the year pressure in part of our Portfolio in terms of commodity inflation and distribution costs. We are prepared to absorb those. And in terms of margin improvements, we are committed to continuously improve our margin profile. But as I said, it's going to be a mix of continuing search for efficiencies, but also investment in our business, whether it's brand-building activities or new innovation program.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Jayson. Appreciate the question. And thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks.\nJoseph Wolk: Great. Thank you, Chris. And thank you really, everyone for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter results and updated outlook. We are incredibly proud of the relentless focus each of our JNJ colleagues apply to really meet patient and consumer needs around the globe, resulting in a strong financial performance this quarter across the enterprise while simultaneously investing for a very strong future. I'm very confident in our outlook for the rest of 2021. Our business is performing even beyond the mathematical year-on-year comps. And hopefully, that's your takeaway today. Thank you for your time and bye for now.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thibaut Mongon",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, Jennifer. And good morning to all of you on the call. I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year we focused on execution across our broad-based portfolio, delivered solid results, growing 3% operationally. And this year, we continue to demonstrate a strong level of performance.  The strategy we set a couple of years ago for the Consumer Health segment to be focused on personal health with science-based, professionally endorsed brands, and advancing our digital capabilities, continues to strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers worldwide, resulting in strong quarterly results and solid year-to-date performance.  Our Consumer Health sector grew 9.2% operationally in the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted operational growth for Acquisitions and Divestitures was 10% in the quarter and 3.3% on a year-to-date basis.  And as Chris stated in his remarks, these year-to-date results are a better representation of our performance given the fluctuations we've seen in the market due to COVID-19 dynamics and seasonality overall. We saw strong year-to-date performance for brands in our two strongholds such as ZYRTEC, PEPCID, and NICORETTE in OTC, or AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, and OGX in Skin Health.  In our specialty areas, brands like LISTERINE, AVEENO Baby, and BAND-AID also contributed nicely to our year-to-date results. And from a geographic perspective, we are encouraged to see that we grew across all regions in the quarter. Now, if we look into the future, even if we will continue to see variability in categories depending on seasonality and local market conditions, we are confident that our strategy is working.  We have the right portfolio to continue to deliver solid results; well balanced, both in terms of categories we compete in, and in terms of geographic presence. And lastly, we have been able to achieve our solid sales results while simultaneously improving our margin profile. Our efforts on end-to-end profitability improvement, including portfolio optimization and network improvements, have delivered to plan.  Our year-to-date adjusted IBT is approximately 27%, or another 250 basis point improvement over last year. We have made great strides in increasing our profitability to become a leader within our peer set.  And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve our margin profile, while at the same time investing to grow the topline, launching new products, and Chris referenced some of them in his remarks, and managing through anticipated higher commodity and distribution costs in the back half of 2021.  So in a nutshell, Consumer Health delivered a strong quarter and a solid first half. Our strategy is working and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the categories and market in which we compete. And now, let me hand over to Ashley McEvoy. Ashley? Now, we see strong momentum across our broad-based portfolio as I told you earlier this morning, Our categories will continue to be impacted by market level conditions, seasonality. Having said that, we have proven, over the past 18 months, is that our broad-based portfolio, in terms of both categories and geographies, allowed us to weather whatever external conditions happen. And we expect continued momentum into the back half of the year. And in Consumer Health, I would say that we have a very strong portfolio of iconic brands that we continue to develop very quickly. Mostly, we continuously scan the market for opportunities to find either new go-to-market models or close gaps in our portfolio. But if you look at the acquisitions we have made over the past couple of years, we are really pleased with their performance. All of them, whether it's in self-care or skin health, are performing well. And that's very encouraging for the future. Yeah. And to your question on consumer. As I said, we have seen the first half, and we continue to expect into the back half of the year pressure in part of our Portfolio in terms of commodity inflation and distribution costs. We are prepared to absorb those. And in terms of margin improvements, we are committed to continuously improve our margin profile. But as I said, it's going to be a mix of continuing search for efficiencies, but also investment in our business, whether it's brand-building activities or new innovation program."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jennifer Taubert",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Joe, and hello everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. I'd like to start by thanking my Janssen colleagues around the world for their relentless focus on delivering for patients. As a result, I'm proud to share that our Pharmaceutical sector had another strong quarter of above-market growth.  As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business delivered $12.6 billion in worldwide sales in the second quarter, with adjusted operational growth of approximately 14%. Our base business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated robust growth at 12.6%. This is our third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $12 billion, and our growth was broadly based across geographic regions and our therapeutic area.  We continue to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio, delivering double-digit growth for 9 key brands, including our oncology medicines, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, and ERLEADA, our immunology medicines, TREMFYA and STELARA, our pulmonary hypertension medicines, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, and INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in our neuroscience portfolio.  Our leading commercial and market access capabilities enabled increased market penetration and share gains across our key promoted brands. And as we shared in our transparency report this year, our growth continues to come from volume gains and not price.  This is a strong indication that our life-changing medicines are reaching more patients each day worldwide. It's important to note, we continue to be a trough investor in research and development. This investment fuels our pipeline and builds the foundation for our long-term growth.  During the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our pipeline of transformational medicines. I'll highlight just a few of the key milestones and achievements. First, in May, the FDA approved amivantamab now known as RYBREVANT. This is the first by-specific antibody approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.  This is our first approved treatment for lung cancer, which we hope will be an important area for us going forward. This is our second NME approval of this year. PONVORY, or ponesimod, was our first 2021 NME approval, and this was by the FDA in March, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the second quarter, it was also approved by the European Commission and Health Canada.  We also advanced our BCMA CAR-T cell therapy program, Cilta-Cel, for patients with multiple myeloma. In the second quarter, the U.S. FDA granted our BCMA CAR-T priority review. A marketing authorization was filed with the European Medicines Agency, and submission was made to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency.  We anticipate FDA approval of Cilta-Cel as our third NME approval later this year. In addition, our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX continues to benefit an increasing number of patients. In the second quarter, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for 2 additional patient populations; as combination therapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis, which is the first and only approved therapy for this rare and life-threatening blood disorder; and as combination therapy for adults with pretreated multiple myeloma.  Additionally, subsequent to the quarter, the FDA -approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, our sixth indication specific to our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX. I'm proud of our Pharmaceutical results in the second quarter and feel confident in our ability to make 2021 our tenth consecutive year of above-market growth.  Our outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. Before I close, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Pharmaceuticals business review on November 18. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive overview of our business, our robust pipeline, and our long-term growth outlook.  We'll cover our key therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology, which are always areas of high interest, and we'll delve deeper into some of our newer areas, including our retina and gene therapy pipeline, and the details behind the breadth of our auto antibody program that came through our acquisition of MOMENTA last year.  I hope you'll be able to join us. So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today. Thibaut, I will now turn it over to you. I can add in. On the Pharma side, most of our core categories are pretty much back to the pre-COVID level, the exception on that actually being CLL. But we're really seeing strength coming back, for example, in the United States and in Europe. And we do anticipate some modest ups and downs, but I think our team really did an extraordinary job last year of partnering with healthcare systems, and physicians, and patients to make sure that they could get on and stay on the therapies that they need. So our outlook for the rest of the year really remains strong for our sector, regardless of what happens with emerging variants and any continued blips as it relates to COVID. What I'd add in, we really focused on being a transformational medical innovator and we know that we do disproportionately invest in R&D versus the other areas of our business. If you take a look at the strength of our pipeline as well as the continued progression, we are seeing more assets transitioning into those later stages of development that require additional costs. And as Joe had indicated earlier, the beauty right now of the strength that we have for the business is it's allowing us to invest for those future waves of innovation. We feel real good about the level of investment for R&D in the Pharm group. Perfect. So then, as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX, we saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter. Also, the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through, and our 6th indication specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business, already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form, and that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the U.S. And so very, very rapid adoption as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. We're very, very confident in the uptake and this is really providing significant benefits from patients going from multiple-hour infusions down to a 3-5 minute injection. A lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, a 22% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously less than that in the U.S.. In the U.S., we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patients starts are still down a little bit and CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so we did see a slower growth rate, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter. but we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains a number 1 prescribed treatment in CLL, and Relapsed/Refractory MCL, and also Waldenstrom. It's a number one BTKI wherever they are prescribed. It's also the only agent that's got demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL, and a safety profile that's supported by over 5 years of follow-up in clinical experience. We believe we've got a great profile that stands up competitively with IMBRUVICA and will continue to be able to deliver great growth for us going forward. One of the things that helps us be really successful here is that we're truly agnostic to the source of innovation. So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It' not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. So for example, late last year, we brought in [Indiscernible] we made the acquisition of MOMENTA, we brought in TARIS as a drug delivery device for bladder, a gene therapy for geographic atrophy and age-related macular degeneration from Hemera. And so we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technologies in our key areas of focus. And many times that's coming from our internal labs. Many times it's also coming externally. Our strategy and interest there remains the same and making sure that we've got the best innovation for patients going forward. I feel like we're doing a really good job on that front. I'll jump in on the vaccine question first. Really, we're really proud of what we've been able to do in bringing forward a COVID vaccine. And we see this as, really, the start of what will become a vibrant vaccine business for Johnson & Johnson. You were talking about the halo effect or a knock-on effect. We believe the good that we're doing in the world, and that we will continue to be doing on the COVID vaccine, is a great start. And in our pipeline right now, we've got a number of vaccines in development that we hope to have positive results coming from, including an RSV vaccine, an HIV vaccine, one for prevention of sepsis and others that we're looking at. We hope this to be a start of what will become a very vibrant vaccine business for us over time."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter, and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone is having a safe, healthy, and enjoyable summer.  As Chris referenced, Johnson & Johnson 's businesses remain leaders, or are better positioned, within the markets in which they compete. While the pandemic makes it difficult to reliably gauge what results will be in any given quarter, you likely noticed that all three segments beat your expectations.  We continue to be poised for further growth and value creation not just in 2021, but more importantly for 2022 and beyond. Over the past 18 months, our people have been a driving force behind our success. And guided by our credo, they have demonstrated resilience and agility while remaining committed to ensuring our life-saving medicines and products reach patients and consumers around the world.  Thanks to the efforts of our 136,000 colleagues across the world, Johnson & Johnson continues to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere. Foundational to any healthy business is a focus and commitment to broader stakeholder stewardship.  We are proud to share the progress we are making in a transparent and accountable manner. A few weeks ago, we held our annual ESG Investor Update following the publication of our 2020 Health for Humanity report and our 2025 goals. Through these goals, we aim to deliver even greater long-term value to our broad set of stakeholders.  I hope you had the opportunity to view this webcast. If you have not, the replay is still available on the Johnson & Johnson website. Let's get into the results with an update on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow, with approximately $8 billion year-to-date.  We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt, resulting in $8 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way that will benefit stakeholders over the long term.  Our dividend remains a key priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.8 billion to shareholders. Regarding M&A, we continually evaluate strategic opportunities that have the potential to further enhance our business, while also driving better health outcomes for patients and consumers.  Since Chris covered highlights from our second quarter performance and our worldwide shares will provide sector-specific commentary to open the Q&A session. I will now move directly to providing the update to our full-year 2021 guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance.  For clarity, I will first comment on our core business revenue and then remark on our anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which is now included in our enterprise guidance. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect our base business defined as excluding our COVID-19 vaccine to remain strong.  Based on this confidence, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 9.5% to 10.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance.  We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, which accounts for previously completed divestitures in Medical Devices, Consumer Health, as well as within other oncology in Pharmaceuticals, resulting in an operational sales range of 9% to 10%, or $90 billion to $90.8 billion for a midpoint of 9.5% or $90.4 billion.  While we don't predict currency movements, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.18, and in consideration of other currency movements, there is no change from our previous estimates, resulting in favorable currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points.  This results in estimated reported sales in the range of $91.3 billion to $92.1 billion, an increase of 10.5% to 11.5%, or 11% at the midpoint versus 2020. Now, a few words on the expected contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine to our updated full-year 2021 guidance.  Our goal has always been to bring forth our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. We are proud to have been part of the unprecedented collaboration in the healthcare industry that has led to a number of authorized vaccines in the marketplace.  Chris shared earlier that we recorded vaccine revenue in the quarter. Specifically, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed a $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $264 million. At this point, revenue from the first half of the year was provisionally recorded at $5 per dose, given that volumes during the pandemic period were uncertain. Currently, we expect the ultimate final not-for-profit price could be as much as $8 per dose.  The final not-for-profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net cost incurred, as well as, volumes produced during the pandemic period. Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advanced purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter.  Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include 10 manufacturing sites for various stages of production. On July 2nd, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approved an expansion of our facility in the Netherlands increasing our capacity to produce active drug substance.  The FDA also released 5 batches of drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility under the Emergency Use Authorization, and we continue to work with health authorities on the approval of additional drug substance manufactured at Emergent.  Now, I do appreciate that many of you are understandably looking beyond 2021-2022. It is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine, given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variance. But as recent published clinical data indicates, our vaccine appears to have durability for at least eight months and is effective against the recent Delta variant and other highly prevalent viral variance.  At this time, I'd caution you to wait to include future-year vaccine projections in your models for our business. The COVID-19 vaccine market will continue to evolve, and we look forward to sharing additional details as more data become available, including the role our vaccine will play for you to forecast future years.  Given this and what I already provided on our base business, our new updated guidance expectations are reflected on this slide, reflecting an enterprise total revenue of $94.2 billion at the midpoint. Moving to other items of the P&L. We are now expecting our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year, slightly less than our prior guidance as we continue to invest for the long term.  We are increasing our other income estimate to a range of $800 million to $900 million. This increase is primarily attributable to increased investment returns related to our employee benefit programs. As a reminder, pension service costs are recorded in operating expenses, while any investment performance related to our employee benefit programs are recorded in other income net expense.  Moving to interest expense. Based on our year-to-date experience, we are lowering our estimate to a range of 100 million to 200 million. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 16.0% to 17.0% based on certain one-time benefits realized in the first half of the year. The results of these updates translate to increasing our earnings guidance.  We are also tightening the guidance range. The new adjusted operational per share guidance range is 18.4% to 19.6%, or $9.50 to $9.60, with a midpoint of 19% or $9.55 per share. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, we expect a slight change from what we communicated on the Q1 earnings call.  Currency will now impact EPS by 1.2% or $0.10 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.60 to $9.70 or a midpoint of $9.65, increasing 20.2%. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue.  I am now pleased and want to thank our worldwide shares, Jennifer Taubert, Thibaut Mongon, and Ashley McEvoy, for their participation in the Q&A portion of our call today. I know this audience values having these leaders on earnings calls from time-to-time.  Before we jump into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to ask Jennifer, Thibaut, and Ashley, each to provide a brief business segment update and qualitative outlook for the remainder of 2021. Jennifer, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Yes. Thanks for the question, Louise. I think it's probably best maybe that you hear from both Ashley and Jennifer on this specific perspective. Ashley? I'd also add, Louise, that I think we've got to really tip our cap to the healthcare administrators, health professionals across the globe. We're in a much better position to handle a pandemic than we were of March of last year. And so, certainly, that would have, I would say, a favorable impact on whatever unfavorable events may occur. We really need to recognize just the great resiliency and agility that those individuals have shown as well. Yeah. And Larry, with respect to your question on guidance overall, I think I'd almost have to mirror a little bit what Ashley had said, the comparables were going to be most pronounced for the second quarter. There will be a little bit of benefit as we look into the third and fourth quarter. As you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter. But I really looking at the underlying strength of each of our businesses, improved share in the markets in which we lead and for those that which we don't lead. In addition to the -- what you heard from all 3 of our segment leaders, just an improved cadence of innovation; new approvals, new offerings that offer better healthcare solutions. That's how we're thinking about it. From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top-line growth, and EPS growth, that will approach 20%. We think that's very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised to the upside as well. We want to make sure that we don't only deliver strong results in the current quarter or the next 2 quarters, but really in the middle and back half of this decade as well. We think we're very well-positioned to do that. Yes. Chris, let me take a stab at that and maybe, Jennifer, you can chime in with anything that I might have missed. But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say, coming into the year, just like every other Company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold; would there be new variants? And so we took a, what I thought was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations at the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year. What we did learn, and it really is a credit to the leaders that you've heard from today and their teams, just how important it is reaching out to customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how it was impacting the businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some, I'll call it a goodwill factor, with respect to how we're approaching our business today. With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing, and really what we all take great pride in is there's not one big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again, across all three segments that really positions us well. Last year, you might recall we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels. Even with all the questions and uncertainty, and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. We're actually at a pace this year through 6 months, about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a 6 month comparator. So we feel very well-positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion, we think we're hitting the mark across all aspects. I don't know, Jennifer, if there's anything else you want to add. And just so nobody has a takeaway we're only investing in pharmaceuticals, we're investing in digital surgery capabilities that Ashley mentioned, we're investing in the consumer space, connecting with the consumer in more digital enabled ways. So it's really across the board. Yeah. Josh, I would say at this point, it's really a minimal, in terms of both the segment, as well as, certainly Johnson & Johnson 's margin profile. Thus far through 6 months, it's been dilutive, again, to a minimal amount. We expect that dilution to reverse itself in the second half of this year. But again, being a not-for-profit, there's no material impact on EPS despite the 2.5 billion revenue estimate that we've provided earlier today. Yes. Terrence, thanks for the questions. I would say in terms of the booster, whether it's needed or not, I think we should really defer to health officials around the world as to what that call will be. We do like the durability of at least 8 months. For our vaccine, we think that's better than some of the other vaccines that are out there, not to disparage them in any manner whatsoever, but health official still have not made any type of decisions on when or if a booster will be needed, so we'll just defer to them when more data is collected. And Terrence, with respect to your question on the 2-dose study for the vaccine, we would expect that data to be late Q3, early Q4 at this point. And, Joanne, I'll just say you're going to force me to review the transcripts in maybe more detail than I usually do. I didn't think our language changed much. We always remain pretty aggressive when it comes to rigorous portfolio management; making sure that we're making the most of the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities that we have, and we just got to find deals that really fit the financial construct in a disciplined way. Whether it's in MedTech, Pharmaceuticals, or Consumer, we look across the board really monthly, if not more often, at opportunities that may fit nicely within the Johnson & Johnson business. Great. Thank you, Chris. And thank you really, everyone for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter results and updated outlook. We are incredibly proud of the relentless focus each of our JNJ colleagues apply to really meet patient and consumer needs around the globe, resulting in a strong financial performance this quarter across the enterprise while simultaneously investing for a very strong future. I'm very confident in our outlook for the rest of 2021. Our business is performing even beyond the mathematical year-on-year comps. And hopefully, that's your takeaway today. Thank you for your time and bye for now."

            "name": "Ashley McEvoy",
            "content": "Thank you. Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning. Thanks for joining. Let me just begin with across JNJ, how privileged we feel to work in healthcare because we recognize that what we do matters, especially now. We're united by our purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of Health for Humanity and we're propelled by our MedTech aspiration to re-imagine the future of health today, in three ways. One is innovating across the continuum of patient care, two is prioritizing and modernizing health, and three is promoting health equity and wellness.  We continue to see strong evidence that our focus and actions to impact human health and improve our competitiveness is working. This quarter, MedTech delivered sales of $7 billion, representing adjusted operational growth of 59% versus 2020 and, as Chris mentioned, up 7% versus 2019, bringing our first half of 2021 revenue performance to just over 5% compared to 2019. Our sales reflect market recovery and our positive competitive momentum.  Eight of our $11 billion MedTech platforms grew versus the second quarter 2019. And quarter one '21 share trends show, that we have maintained or gained share in ten of these platforms. We have an exciting pipeline, and we've achieved some truly amazing results in the first half of this year which position us well to continue our growth momentum. We've launched 17 major products in the first half of 2021. This is the highest number of first-half of the year launches in 5 years for our business. These include products which will strengthen our core like TECNIS SYNERGY, our most advanced premier intraocular lens in surgical vision; and the ENSEAL X1 Curved Tissue Sealer, a next-generation advanced energy solution in our surgery franchise. We continue to focus on significant global health concerns, including myopia management, where we plan to have a portfolio of solutions for patients. And we are progressing all things digital with solutions covering the entire paradigm of care, including open and laparoscopic procedures, orthopedics, and illuminal, interventional and vision. Our Monarch platform achieved a significant milestone reaching over 100 customers and enabling over 8000 bronchoscopies, which is life-changing, and potentially life-saving, in the detection and treatment of lung cancer. VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee procedures, launched in the United States and received regulatory approval in Australia this month. We're extremely pleased with the early customer engagement and feedback confirming the differentiation of this next-generation solution. And Ottava, our soft tissue digital surgery offering, continues to progress its key development milestones. We also recognize that the digitization of healthcare is happening and rapidly accelerating technology like this, making it possible to deliver new ways of care. An example of this is from our innovative team in China to develop the virtual solution powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to more effectively train and expand the number of highly skilled electrophysiologists and provide broader access to high-quality care. Learning curves went from novice to experts from a year to 4 months. In the first 4 months of launch, 150 newly trained physicians delivered care to 7500 patients. It's no surprise our Electrophysiology business in China is so strong. And we continue to leverage science to influence industry trends and positively impact patient outcomes and human health. Just this month, the UK modified their NICE guidelines to recommend the use of PLUS SUTURES as a standard of care, giving the evidence supporting their role in reducing surgical site infections and are necessary cost to the healthcare system. Regarding the pandemic, we are seeing light at the end of COVID-19 tunnel, but this remains, as we all know, a very fluid situation. The pace of continued recovery will depend on multiple factors, including the speed at which global populations are vaccinated, healthcare capacity, and the ability to manage through surges, as well as the rate at which patients seek treatment. In closing, and I'd like to emphasize that our strong quarter 2 results and continuing momentum can be attributed to our purpose-driven, globally diverse team, which embody a winning spirit every day. Their resilience, agility, and creativity have taken us to the next level in our business, build stronger relationships with our customers and patients, and defined a clear vision of our future. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. Yeah, Louise. I would say -- listen, we're encouraged by, quite frankly, several things. How -- the ability that hospitals can manage through capacity in surges and labor, as well as, obviously, the vaccination efforts around the world. And just the patient, there's a significant backlog of care. If I look at the UK, my goodness, there's like 5,000,000 patients waiting for medical interventions, 400,000 of those folks waiting for surgery for the past 12 months. But as we know, it's not going to be linear. We do know hospital systems in the United States are starting to delay care right now. I think quarter-to-quarter, it will improve, but it will never be a linear line. Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. I think what you heard is, in quarter 2 we were up about 7% relative to 2019, and that was pretty broad based. I'd say 3 out of 4 of our franchises posted growth versus 2019. Orthopedics was down about a point. We were up in the United States about a point. Down about 3 points in orthopedics in OUS in quarter 2, really due to some of the slower moving countries like Japan and India in opening up in COVID. When I think about quarter 3 and quarter 4, I do expect continued momentum. You'll recall last year, we were down about 3% in quarter 3 versus 2019, and we were down about 1.5% in quarter 4 2020 versus '19. I do expect continued progress. I expect Orthopedics to go positive. I expect Vision to accelerate, given a lot of the new product launches. As we've discussed, we think the category is going to be high double-digit. We expect to be more in the high single-digit at the end of this year versus 2019. Yeah. And Bob, just to -- again, thanks for the question. Again, we've had the benefit to learn from how this virus manifests around the world, starting with China. Asia is a region that is above 2019 in terms of procedure volume, clearly really driven by China. We've seen that Japan 's in lockdown. We know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently. We know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been -- which has been at a slower pace than the United States. We actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA, with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations and quite frankly, the backlog of patients that really need to be cared for. As I mentioned, I share a little bit of the waiting list data in the U.K.. And then U.S. in quarter 2 has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down. Medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May that went positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line, given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the U.S., like Florida, like Michigan in the midwest. So, again, I think our systems are unbelievably equipped to manage through this. I have huge respect and admiration for a lot of our customers who are managing COVID as well as non-COVID patients. Yeah, Matt. I think -- thank you for the question. I would tell you that what we've experienced is maybe some bookends like our Electrophysiology business, our AFib, treating cardiac ablation has recovered very expeditiously. And that team right now is just really working on refilling the patient funnel. At the other bookend, I would say would be cataract surgeries, which are -- procedure volumes are still below 2019. We would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace. It's really the pace of vaccinations, pace at hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged, healthy workforce and manage through some of the surges that we're seeing right now in the U.S. and other pockets of the world. And then just really patients sentiment. There's been a lot of investment that JNJ has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts, and data, and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seek ed care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear line. I keep saying that because we learn every week, we take four steps forward and maybe a step back. Thank you. Sure. We've seen really strong performance of the TECNIS Synergy in EMEA. We are growing market share in EMEA in vision surgery and that market's had a lot of available premium intraocular lenses. We're pleased to bring that technology to the United States. We just launched in quarter 2, there's been very good pickup. It's also complemented, as Chris was mentioning, with our first innovation in the phacoemulsifier, the VERITAS. So the combination of those 2 with really our first advancement in Monofocals and the TECNIS Eyhance, which just launched earlier in quarter 1, the combination of those 3 innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the U.S. Surgical Vision. And as you heard in quarter 2, we did grow revenue versus 2019 in OUS. And so I expect that that should get -- have the U.S. start to pick up more in the back half of the year. Thanks, Joanne. I'll start and then I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a bit about M&A and some of the other businesses as well. I would say we were very encouraged. We've had about 750 on-hand demonstrations with our VELYS knee digital surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things.  The value of the system, smaller footprint, the image's interoperative capabilities, and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams, the workflows, reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offering. It's new. We just got approval also in Australia, so we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that were assessing and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes, so stay tuned on that. And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say for MedTech point of view. You're seeing, we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A, really behind getting into iHealth. Getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it standard of care changing technology. It's like new ways in ablation. For liver ablation was the first indication. Right now we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our endoluminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors -- bleeding tumor cells. We're also in first-in-human in oncolytic viruses and drug delivery using Monarch. As well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter 2 relative to 2019. Again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down to. But I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a little bit about M&A."

Moving to today's agenda, I will review first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and we'll spend some time on 2021 qualitative commentary, and we'll outline our updated guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes. Now let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $22.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.9% versus the first quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 5.5% as currency had a positive impact of 2.4 points. In the US, sales increased 3.9%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 12.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 7.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6% worldwide, 3.9% in the US and 8.2% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.2 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.32 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.17 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset, amortization expense and special items for both periods adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59 representing increases of 12.5% and 12.6%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3%. I would now comment on business segment sales performance highlighting items that build upon the slide you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and declined 3.3% with declines in the US of 7.4% and modest growth of 0.5% outside of the US. The Consumer Health results reflect negative comparisons due to prior year pantry loading and increased COVID-19 demand, particularly in over-the-counter medicines. Excluding the prior-year COVID-19 comparison, the Consumer Health segment grew low-single-digits in the quarter. Over-the-counter medicines declined 14.8%. Globally results were negatively impacted by the prior-year comparisons, I previously mentioned, coupled with continued impacts of social distancing restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences. Partially offsetting declines were US share gains, primarily in TYLENOL, ZYRTEC and PEPCID as well as strong performance of NICORETTE outside the US. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise grew by 2.8% driven by strong performance outside the US for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to new product innovations and strength in e-commerce. Results were partially offset by US COVID-19 related market contraction in makeup removal wipes. Consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, including oral care, which grew 4.5% from continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to category growth and strong promotions partially offset by divestitures. Worldwide growth excluding divestitures was approximately 8%. Additionally the Baby Care franchise grew by 9.5% as a result of strength in Johnson's outside the US, primarily in Latin America and Asia Pacific regions across all categories coupled with AVEENO baby growth in e-commerce globally. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.2 billion grew 7.1% with strength in both the US, increasing by 6.4% and OUS with sales increasing by 7.9%. Sales in the quarter included a small contribution in the US from Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, following its emergency use authorization in February. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels with seven key products realizing double-digit growth in the first quarter. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 5.5%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by continued declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continue to show strength in all regions growing at 15.4%, driven by increased market growth and share gains. US share increased roughly four points in Crohn's Disease and nearly 10-points in ulcerative colitis. STELARA growth was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to a prior period pricing adjustment in Q1, 2020, and an unfavorable comparison to increased sales in Q1 2020 resulting from COVID-19 related longer scrip durations in the US and Europe. TREMFYA grew 37.8% with strong double-digit growth in both the US and OUS driven by share gains in psoriasis of 2.7 points in the US, continued global expansion into new markets and continued penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.6%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing 42.2%, driven by share growth across all lines of therapy and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the US and EU. DARZALEX continues to penetrate the frontline setting aided by recently approved line extensions that penetrate new patient populations, posting nearly three points of share growth in Line one in the US this quarter. ERLEADA continued its global momentum with growth of 79.7% in the quarter driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 5.6% globally with increased volume growth driven by our market-leading share and increased persistency as patients extend the duration of therapy. However, this was partially offset by the market contraction due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. Growth was also negatively impacted by one-time items including the increased demand in Q1 of 2020 related to longer-term scrip durations in anticipation of pandemic-related restrictions and higher levels of clinical trial volume in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of these one-time events, global growth for IMBRUVICA would have been double-digits. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio grew 6.9% driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular/metabolism/other declined 4.1% this quarter driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA which was partially offset by growth of 11.7% in XARELTO driven by continued demand and a one-time favorable prior period pricing adjustment in the current quarter which contributed over half of XARELTO's growth in the quarter. Lastly, our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 13.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 13.5% and UPTRAVI growth of 20.9% both driven by market penetration and share gains. I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales were $6.6 billion growing 8%. Growth versus prior year was primarily driven by market recovery from procedures impacted by COVID-19 along with continued momentum driven by commercial initiatives and our recently launched new products that are further enhancing our competitiveness across several areas of the business. Additionally, selling days positively impacted worldwide growth by 190 basis points. We expect the full-year impact from selling days excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020 will be minimal. While recovery dynamics continue to vary across procedure type and geography, our results reflect continued momentum with nine of our 11 priority platforms delivering global growth in Q1 with six of these delivering double-digit worldwide growth. As you consider regional dynamics, Asia Pacific was the first region to be impacted by COVID-19 and experienced the most significant sales declines in the first quarter last year. Asia Pacific realized strong market recovery, primarily in China against this low sales base from the prior year. So that coupled with our commercial efforts to expand into Tier 2 and Tier 3 hospitals in China resulted in strong double-digit growth in this region. COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable in the US. However, the market has been resilient and continues to recover resulting in growth of 5.4% in the US. Sales declined in Europe and Latin America where there continues to be a higher level of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and procedure deferrals. Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional solutions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 25.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by recovery in the market coupled with the strength of our broad-based portfolio, focus on commercial execution and introduction of new products such as an update to our CARTO 3 System and the CARTO PRIME Mapping Module which further enhanced our market position globally. These new product introductions support improved mapping capabilities and reduced ablation times during atrial fibrillation procedures. Worldwide orthopedics grew 1.2% versus the prior year with continued COVID-19 impacts of procedure recovery. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 9.5% reflecting market recovery and success of our newer product introductions that continue to support our market-leading position in trauma such as the most comprehensive Cannulated Compression Headless Screw system on the market and the RIA 2 system designed for long-bone grafts. Hips returned to worldwide growth this quarter increasing 3.2% driven by market recovery and our continued leadership position in the interior approach and demand for the ACTIS Stem aided by our other enabling technologies in hip navigation. Knees declined 9.9% globally, primarily due to slower market recovery in these more deferrable procedures in addition to some softness stemming from business mix dynamics. We are on track for the commercialization of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe the combination of this launch along with our differentiated VELYS Digital Solutions and Attune platform including some cementless offerings will enhance our portfolio and support improve performance, as procedures continue to recover. Spine declined 0.6%, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on this market coupled with some one-time stocking reductions in China resulting from the consolidation to a national distribution model, worth about 250 basis points globally. The decline was partially offset by the success of the recently launched products such as, Symphony, Conduit and Fibergraft as well as partnerships which further enhance our offerings such as, the X-Pac Expandable Cage. Advanced surgery grew 14.3% versus the prior year with double-digit growth globally in endocutters, biosurgery and energy, primarily from robust growth in Asia driven by market recovery and market share gains due to new product launches, globalization of our portfolio, including biosurgery, Surgiflo Plus Thrombin launch in Japan, and commercial investments to expand our coverage in China. In general surgery, wound closure, grew 12% globally with a growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 15.7% in OUS. Results were driven by recovery in the markets as well as continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio including the STRATAFIX barbed suture family. The U.S. contact lens growth of 7.2% reflects the strength of our commercial execution and our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, including the recent launch of Acuvue Oasys, multi-focal lenses which were designed to provide clear vision at all distances. Channel inventory increases related to continued COVID-19 volatility and support of this new product launch contributed about 400 basis points to growth. Growth outside the U.S. of 0.9% reflects a slower market recovery in Japan and Europe. The global surgical vision grew 11.2% due to a combination of a recovery in both cataract and refractive procedures as well as the continued strength of recent product introductions, including Tecnis Toric II and early success of Tecnis Eyhance driving improved share momentum in both the U.S, and OUS markets. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning our adjusted EPS of $2.59 reflects a reported increase of 12.6%, and an operational increase of 8.3%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed the misstatement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. The cost of product sold improved versus 2020 as a percent to sales due to favorable product mix in the pharmaceutical business, and favorable volume and mix in the medical devices business. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2020, medical devices results included the establishment of COVID-19 inventory reserve which did not repeat in 2021. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved due to leveraging the medical devices business, resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels investing 14.2% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the first quarter of 2020 by 170 basis points, driven by portfolio progression in the pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and divestiture related activity. However, as a reminder, we treat significant gains as a special item and these gains are therefore excluded from adjusted earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased from 11% in the first quarter of 2020 to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the impact of one-time items in 2020 that did not repeat. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35% to 37.1%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical devices margin improved by 640 basis points driven by inventory reserves recorded in 2020 associated with the impact of COVID-19, which did not repeat in the current quarter and overall expense leveraging in 2021 resulting from the medical devices sales recovery. Consumer health margins improved by 150 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable product mix partially offset by increased investment in research and development. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full-year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced much like every other company in every other industry. COVID-19 cases were on the rise, worldwide lockdowns were in effect and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our lifesaving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic and our first-quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long-term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities when appropriate to create value over the long-term. Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few starting with our pharmaceutical business. First, we received US approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for Ponvory in multiple sclerosis, our first EMEA approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA Car-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma and we anticipate US approval later this year. As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the phase 2 development of Tesnatilimab, an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial. Within our medical devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for Tecnis Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years. Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect the commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name, Acuvue Ability, pending health authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients, while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline. As Chris commented to earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first-quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So, let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. Our pharmaceutical segment is on track with our expectations and in 2021, we expect to deliver a 10th consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven not dependent on price. You may have noticed that we issued our fifth annual Janssen US Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than t$29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated. In consumer health, prior-year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile, driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs. In medical devices, better execution, new innovative offerings, and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage, and unemployment rates along with the easing of mobility restrictions will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full-year outlook we had in January. Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS, already projected to grow at 18%, or 1.8 times greater than sales growth. Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please know that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted. Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales, on an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion, or 8.2% to 9.4%. While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.19, results in a still favorable, but to a lesser degree currency impact of $1.3 billion, or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9%, or 10.3 at that midpoint versus 2020. Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are however comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movement, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57 or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models. This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in medical devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in medical devices. Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome, but more importantly accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Stoffels: Thank you, Joe and I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than three million people globally. From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single-shot easily transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing in affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country phase 3 ENSEMBLE study that demonstrates the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, beginning day 28 of the vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus including the B.1.3.5.1 variant. Based on the robust data, we submitted to health authorities, we received emergency use authority -- authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and Emergency Use listing from the World Health Organization. We began US distribution in March with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the Sisonke study, an open-label phase 3b vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline healthcare workers in South Africa, where the B.1.3.5.1variant has become dominant and where there is limited supportive care of wide -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across the African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single-shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical tool for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. Last Tuesday, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of their vaccine in the US. ACIP will reconvene this Friday and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of their vaccine in Europe and paused vaccinations in all of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while we've updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and wellbeing of the people who use our product is our number one priority. And we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited report by healthcare professionals. We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine. And in view of the raise -- raging pandemic, that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA to work toward continuing vaccination to end the global pandemic. We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the paused in the investigator-led collaborative Sisonke study, provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- of available safety data from Sisonke study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of healthcare workers in South Africa soon. We are looking forward to the outcome of -- from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency, Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC, as it is called and are looking forward to working with EMA to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. Moving on to manufacturing, the quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with the U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. Our goal remains ensuring all drugs and drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standards and securing emergency use authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single-shot doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. In conclusion, I want to note that, COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. Now I will turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thank you, Paul. We will now move to a Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?\nQuestion-and:\nOperator: Yes. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. And I appreciate all the color on the business dynamics here. I just have two questions, centered around, the vaccine I guess, first how do you see this clotting risk issue being addressed. Is this going to be just some sort of safety warning to physicians? Or do you think that's going to be a way to identify certain populations where this might not be an appropriate vaccine? And maybe tied to that, how are you thinking about addressing public safety perceptions, given what seems to be a very rare side effect if in fact [indiscernible] once vaccinations resume. If I could just slip another quick one on vaccines in there, just want to make sure I'm clear as well. On the guidance for 2021, are there vaccine sales beyond Q1 reflective of that guidance? Or just given some the uncertainty is that not being included in the updated guidance? Thanks so much.\nPaul Stoffels: Okay. Yes, let me take the first question. We are working very closely both with FDA CDC as well with EMA and the PRAC, on addressing your first question on risk and whether there will be guidance. And we'll work closely if that comes out in the course of the week to implement that globally. But also restore the confidence in the vaccine. It's an extremely rare event. We hope by making people aware as well as putting clear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines in place that we can restore the confidence in our vaccine.\nJoe Wolk: And Chris with respect to financial guidance, there is nothing in our future outlook with respect to that at this point in time. So we will -- when it's warranted certainly provide updates. Right now we're just commenting to what was actually experienced in the first quarter. Thanks for your question.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me. Joe, can you talk a little bit you know medical device sales came in better than our expectations? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the end markets with regard to the recovery? And can you also secondly talk about the quarterly EPS phasing. Why didn't you raise EPS guidance more despite the beat Q1 EPS is usually about 24%, 25% of full-year EPS whereas the guidance implies Q1 EPS is about 27% using that midpoint. So why not raise the guidance more? Thanks for taking the questions guys.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey, Larry. Thank you very much for your questions. This is Alex. Why don't I go first and look before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout-out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus or minus associates of Johnson & Johnson who have been consistently going to work putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic. Two; a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track, and we're very thankful to them. And last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability the Johnson & Johnson remains a very consistent and in fact stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. If you look at our competitive position whether its market share on all of our major $28 billion plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline, progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress in spite of a lot of other dynamics. So giving specifically to your question on medical -- or medical device marketplace what we would say is, we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19. In the UK, where you're seeing other markets return more than 90% to 100% range, although, we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. As was alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter. Not only as we see more vaccinations, but of course the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our medical device platforms. If you take a look at vision surgery up 11%, if you take a look at our EP business up 26%, our surgery business was well up in the double-digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or endomechanical. Orthopedics particularly large joints, we saw lags slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed-bearing cementless options as well. So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement performance in our medical device sector, as we head through the remainder of the year. Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing.\nJoe Wolk: Sure. Thanks Larry. Thanks for the question. And as usual you have all the numbers at the ready there. So I think I got them all down. But I think the real short story is that I would say, on 10% sales growth, we're going to grow earnings about 18%. And so given the early nature of the year, we challenged our leadership teams and each of our segments and across our functions to see what we can invest today to benefit the future. So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today in hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after. And that's really how we're looking at it. As we -- we have many great opportunities -- and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 million. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations, if some of those opportunities don't come to fruition, we'll certainly be happy to revise guidance upward later on this year. But right now, we thought that was the best course of action to solidify the long term.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I want to focus on two areas. The first one is in Vision Care. And I'm trying to parse through, how much of the delivery is easy comp share loss and/or gain and just recovery in elective procedures? And then I want to sort of put the second one on the table, which is, it sounds like orthopedics, particularly, is lagging. Do you have a view on when that may recover? And just more broadly speaking, is there a pattern to segment recovery that you anticipate throughout the year? Thank you.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey, Joanne, this is Alex. Thank you very much for your question. Look, in Vision Care overall, we think our performance was solid. We have seen the contact lens business in the surgery business be significantly impacted over the course of 2020. We have seen gradual improvement in the back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. We think our Vision Care, our contact lens business is in very good shape. We think our share position is stable to increasing. And we think we've seen, definitely, an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comments. And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or multi-focal and contact lenses, and the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business will continue to bear out in stronger performance and share gains through the year. Regarding orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw very strong performance, for example, in our trauma business, growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are, perhaps, the most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, we're lagging somewhat. But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals and we see systems work their way through backlogs and, of course, in our business being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters. Thank you.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thank you and good morning. Joe, I was wondering if you could comment on how your 2021 EPS guidance might look if you exclude the impact of COVID reserve release and the spending on the vaccine, just wanted to kind of maybe get a sense for EPS for the true underlying business. And then I'll just state my -- the second topic I'd love you to comment on as well is -- just wanted to get your latest thinking on the potential to shift to more of a for-profit model as we potentially exit the emergent phase. I realize it might be a little early to talk about that, but just wanted to get your latest thinking on the potential to shift to more -- to shift post the emergent phase of this pandemic. Thank you very much.\nJoe Wolk: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Bob. With respect to the impact of, I'd say, COVID-19 vaccine investing, in the quarter, it was, let's call it, between $0.05 and $0.10 for the quarter. I'm not overly concerned about that because, as you heard from Paul, we are going through the rigor of the scientific reviews. It appears that there is a very path forward that we'll find out about here in the next couple of days. And we're going to do all we can to make sure that that important solution to address the global pandemic gets back into the marketplace. So, we think we'll recover that, even in the not-for-profit model. With respect to pricing and dynamics, I think you're probably correct in your initial assessment that it's a bit early. But let me turn it over to Joaquin to give you some thoughts that we have on that topic.\nJoaquin Duato: Thanks for the question. Our focus from the beginning in this pandemic was to be a partner in addressing this humanitarian crisis. And as a consequence in order to make sure that we facilitate access globally, we decided to go with a not-for-profit model. Our focus now remains to be able to be a participant in addressing this pandemic. And once this pandemic is over, there will be time to discuss different options. But today our focus is to address this pandemic and be an important partner in making an impact globally in stopping COVID-19.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Bob. Appreciate the questions. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a follow-up to Bob's question just on the vaccine and just how revenues and expenses flow through the P&L. Just wanted to make sure or sanity check the 100 million doses by mid-year in the US. 100 million more by the end of 2021, 200 million doses in Europe, for instance, are those guaranteed contracts? And just in terms of the risk-sharing model and the not-for-profit model, I just wanted to make sure that your downside is protected in terms of expenses going forward already incurred and where those contracts sit?\nJoe Wolk: Yes. Thanks for the follow-up Josh. You know as you can imagine, it is very fluid. But there's nothing in the guidance today that should give analysts or investors concern about any downside with respect to this. Again, we're hope -- we're cautiously hopeful that there is a very viable path forward. We'll learn a lot more in the next couple of days through the regulators. We'll let the process play out, but investors should feel very comfortable with our EPS guidance to protect against any downside that may be envisioned, although I don't see that as likely at this point.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Maybe just one add-on as it relates to Bob's question and Josh your question too. I mean just keep in mind when you look at our underlying performance right, pharm is a segment which was less impacted top-line strong above market. And we continue to improve margins there as well. And you did see margin improvement as well in consumer. So while there's certainly many impacts from COVID year-over-year, I think when you really look underneath the underlying results there's strength both on the top-line and bottom-line that's factored when you look at this year.\nJoe Wolk: That's a good point, Chris. And I think this is going to be a choppy year so we have to look selectively at year-on-year comps. And if you just look at, let's call, what was a normal quarter at least as we knew it back in the first quarter of 2019 you look at our respective businesses. You have -- consumer is up about 8% this quarter versus first quarter of 2019. So again that suggests a strong underlying business. Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5% and medical devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison. But I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have as you heard in our commentary many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. So across all three parts of our business, I think, there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong. You couple that with the investment we continue to make in R&D at elevated levels, I would hope folks feel really good about not just our performance of today but our future performance on the horizon.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thank you. Thanks, Josh. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question was, do you have any thoughts on potential corporate tax increases in the US as well as potential drug pricing reform? And then second question is on Cilta-Cel. I know you're expecting approval this year. Where do you expect it to fit into the treatment paradigm, if it is approved? Did you expect CAR-Ts to gain wider usage over time? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Great, Louise. Thanks for the questions. I will address tax reform as best I can. Obviously that's a fluid situation. Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either. And I can give you one example in one industry and that's Johnson & Johnson where when tax reform was passed in 2017 we committed to increasing our investment in the US by 15% over the upcoming four years versus the preceding four years. We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the US over that four year period. And that's more than $30 billion. Now what does that mean in terms of the US economy? It means more jobs. I mean, we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 act. So, I think when you look at where the US sits with respect to OECD countries, right now we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit toward the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. So, I think it's something that we need a little more fact-based dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive, that the US becomes a source of innovation across all industries. And we don't floor the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year where many US-based companies have stepped up. Joaquin, let me turn it to you to -- just the other items.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. So, with regards to pricing reforms in the US, that was your question Louise. So we continue to expect that there will be pressure to do something to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs. And in that context, the industry could potentially be seen again as a pay-for in another budget reconciliation package for ACA reform or infrastructure legislation. We believe that the negotiations in that regard could be collaborative and that the overall value that innovation -- it's bringing to society, as highlighted by our contributions in COVID-19, will be understood. So that's the way we see it. Now, we think that the most important thing in any price bill or any price reform is to be sure that patients experience an reduction in the out-of-pocket costs and Johnson & Johnson will be a constructive partner in that regard. We think that also that patient cost setting should be based on the net price of medicines, and in that sense we continue to support that type of reform. I also want to take a step back and look at our Pharmaceutical business in the context of pricing reform. I believe that the type of portfolio and growth that we have plays out very well in this situation. Our growth has been based on volume. Our net price declined in 2020 5.7%, and this is the fourth consecutive year that we have net price declines. And we are able and ready to grow in that environment based on having a very broad-based portfolio with 11 products of more than $1 billion, and an R&D-based model that allow us to have a very differentiated pipeline. In the -- in 2020, we invested $9.6 billion in R&D, which is about two times what we invest in sales and marketing. So, we believe that these negotiations could be collaborative and that in that context the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical business is especially well-positioned based on our ability to drive growth based on volume and in our very broadly diversified portfolio. So, about our BCMA CAR-T that we filed in the first quarter of 2020 that was an important milestone in our pipeline. Our initial indication, it's going to be for patients with multiple myeloma that have progressed on available established therapies. Over time, we see BCMA CAR-T, and our BCMA CAR-T specifically progressing into earlier lines of therapy. You could see a moment in which young and fit patients may have BCMA CAR-T as a first-line therapy in an intent to build regimens that are curative. Paul?\nPaul Stoffels: Yes. From the beginning, we selected BCMA CAR-T based on its double binding and that has yield a superior profile with -- in the high 90s overall response rates as well as very high MRD-negativity rates and lasting effect. And so, we think this CAR-T is very strongly positioned in the market and hope to get approval in the second half of the year.\nLouise Chen: Great. Thank you, Paul.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Louise. Appreciate the question. Rob, next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. I have two questions. One is really on the device business. And I think Joe you alluded to this when you were talking about growth comparisons to 2019. But you know there was still a COVID impact in Q1. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of you know, how Q1 sort of shaped up as you work through the month. Did you see a strong recovery in March in the device side of things? And do you feel like -- and this might be an ambiguous and kind of difficult question to truly answer. But I guess do you feel like the worst is behind us even regardless of how vaccinations continue to roll out? And what variants might do? And then I have one vaccine follow-up.\nAlex Gorsky: Hey, Danielle, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for your question. We do there expect to see improving trends in our medical device arena. If we take a look at the first quarter, there was some irregularity just based upon what we are seeing with the virus on a global basis in January versus February and March. But overall, it's clear to us that we're seeing improving trends. And as Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, we would expect that just given year-on-year comps plus what we're seeing underlying both in the United States and Europe in terms of procedure scheduling, confidence in returning to the hospitals and overall surgical volumes. We would expect those to improve through the second and third quarter of this year.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the vaccine side of things, as it relates to manufacturing and what are the alternatives for the volumes that were supposed to be manufactured out of Emergent, if in a worst-case scenario Emergent is prevented from being able to produce for the next few months?\nAlex Gorsky: Thank you, Danielle. Look as Paul said, our goal remains ensuring that all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets our high-quality standards and at the same time that we secure Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at the Emergent Bayview facility. At this time, as we continue in discussions with the FDA, it is premature to speculate on any potential impact that this may have on our timing of our vaccine deliveries. So we will expect to work with the FDA, to work this inspection this -- to close this inspection this week and then we will work with the FDA and Emergent to address those inspections findings. But at this time, it would be premature to speculate on any potential impact that this could happen our delivery timing.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks. And then just real quick to build on Alex's comment maybe just to give you a little bit of color. We're obviously looking at procedures closely surgical procedures imaging as well. Diagnostics is actually outpacing surgical procedures accelerated through the quarter. It's almost in line with where we were pre-pandemic. So that's a positive sign, although the situation of course remains fluid. And then many important procedures such as colorectal again sequentially improved through the quarter and actually grew year-over-year. So again, we're seeing positive signs across. And I think you saw that in our results and pockets of our businesses advanced surgery for example growing over 14%. So we're continuing to look at everything. The situation remains fluid, but there's definitely positive signs on the trends that we're seeing. Thanks, Danielle. Rob, next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much. So I've got one sort of utilization-related question on procedure trends and then I have a follow-up for Alex, if I could on digital strategy. So first, device is up 8.8%, stronger than The Street was expecting. The mix also a bit stronger than expected on advanced surgery and maybe a little bit slower as it's come up in the Q&A here than expected in knees which you mentioned Alex is a couple of times being more deferrable. The question is should we read through this as a bit of a shift to higher acuity procedures at least within your portfolio? And then maybe how should we see the recent rise in hospitalizations potentially affecting the trajectory of recovery over these procedures over the next months and quarters? And then as I mentioned, I have one follow-up on digital.\nAlex Gorsky: Sure, Matt. Thanks a lot for the question. Look Matt, overall, I wouldn't read too much into just these recent results regarding a significant shift overall in our portfolio. I mean, we remain very committed and optimistic about the underlying unmet need and demand across our surgical portfolio, our orthopedics portfolio and our vision care portfolio. But as we alluded to earlier, there are some procedures that in terms of your ability to defer and how elective they truly are that may have a near-term impact on timing. So look overall, if we look at our underlying trends not only versus 2020, but as was noted earlier also versus 2019, we're seeing growth rates consistent overall with what we see for this market. We think this market has the opportunity to grow at about the 5% range over the long-term. And we've been very explicit in our goal to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. That's number one. Number two, we're actually very excited about some of the opportunities that we have for launches. I think, in total, we have more than 21 major launches lined up in our medical device business for this year. We mentioned specifically in the knee area VELYS as well as our ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing, which we think will offer us a real competitive opportunity to generate additional growth in that area. The QDOT MICRO is another great add-on in our EP business that is already growing in excess of 20%. And if you look across our EndoMech, our energy business here too we've got really nice add-on innovations as well as throughout our vision care portfolio. And of course, longer-term the significant opportunity that we see in digital surgery that team has continued to make very solid progress. And we're excited about the long-term prospects there as well. So, now overall, we see a lot of opportunity across our medical device portfolio.\nMatt Miksic: That's great. And maybe just to segue on your second point there about digital. You mentioned robotic knee system's on track. Monarch, obviously leading the market in robotic-assisted lung and Ottava is sort of tracking through clinicals and validation. The question is, is what else -- you've built out this portfolio artificial -- in some artificial intelligence robotic surgery applications and technology, what are the white spaces? Where else do you see investments within digital?\nAlex Gorsky: Sure. Well, look I -- we believe that we're in a very, very early innings of digital, Matt. And first of all, if we just look at the overall penetration rate of digital surgery, it's about 10% in the United States. It's just a couple of percent on a global basis. And so we think, if you consider the overall trends of how technology can be utilized in some of these procedures, if you take a look at our global footprint, we think we will be well positioned there in the long-term. As you mentioned our team has continued to make good progress. We said from the very beginning, look we're building this for the decades, we're not just building this for the next quarter. And we're optimistic about the progress that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that one can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that two that's differentiated; and three that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think long-term can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. And also just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. And as we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that -- all too often patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify for example lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune-type agents locally. And how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining pharma, medical device some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think, it exemplifies, kind of, our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the question. Rob, we'll take our last question now.\nOperator: Yes. The questions come from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Recently there's been some new post-marketing data reported for Xeljanz and the FDA pushed out the PDUFA dates of several JAK inhibitors. You guys are developing a pan-JAK inhibitor for IBD. Would just love your latest perspective on the risk-benefit profile the category here and next steps in your development program? And then just as a follow-up just wanted to confirm that you're on track to supply one billion doses of your COVID-19 vaccine this year. Thank you.\nPaul Stoffels: So thank you for the question on immunology. Look, I'm not going to comment on the safety of the oral JAK inhibitors. What I can tell you is that we have a very strong and robust pipeline in immunology driven by our three existing assets; Symfony, Stelara and Tremfya. Stelara and Tremfya had very strong quarters with close to 40% growth in Tremfya and 15% in Stelara. In Stelara, we continue to grow share in GI both in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And Tremfya is the first and only IL-23 that does have both indications PSA and PSO and it's continued to gain share in both areas. Moving forward, we are excited about our possibilities in immunology with our oral agents. As you mentioned one, we have two in Phase 2. One of them is a pan-JAK oral that we think could be important. We'll have to see the data. And broadly in immunology, we also are excited about the possibilities of nipocalimab, which is our FcRn antibody in pathways that are auto antibody-mediated with very rare diseases that could create a pipeline in a product. So for us, immunology remains a core area of growth and focus and we believe we are in a very strong position to continue to drive growth in the coming years, but even beyond 2025 too.\nJoe Wolk: Yes. Maybe Terence just to pile on to what Joaquin outlined there with the strength of our pipeline. So in pharmaceuticals, specifically, we're looking at 10 new filings that could be new products or indications in 2021, 13 in 2022 and 26 in 2023. So you can see that R&D investment incrementally paying off. With respect to your second question regarding supply, I want to be respectful of the process by which the regulators are going through. We are remediating what we need to remediate. We think that will lend itself to a positive outcome and should put us in a position to meet all of our contractual commitments as they stand today. But let's be respectful of the process and let that play out. We're going to do all we can and provide that effort. As you know and as you've heard in the press we do have some of our best personnel on the -- on-site at Emergent. So they're benefiting from our expertise and we should know more in the next couple of days.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thank you, Terence.\nChris DelOrefice: And thanks to everyone for your questions and continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex just for some brief closing remarks.\nAlex Gorsky: Well let me end where I began, first of all, by thanking all of you for your insightful questions and your ongoing support; two and also by thanking all of our associates at Johnson & Johnson almost 140,000 who have been working 24/7, particularly, over the last 15 months during this pandemic period. We appreciate your ongoing interest and your support and look forward to updating you at our next quarterly call. Thank you very much and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Alex Gorsky",
            "content": "Hey, Larry. Thank you very much for your questions. This is Alex. Why don't I go first and look before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout-out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus or minus associates of Johnson & Johnson who have been consistently going to work putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic. Two; a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track, and we're very thankful to them. And last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability the Johnson & Johnson remains a very consistent and in fact stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. If you look at our competitive position whether its market share on all of our major $28 billion plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline, progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress in spite of a lot of other dynamics. So giving specifically to your question on medical -- or medical device marketplace what we would say is, we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19. In the UK, where you're seeing other markets return more than 90% to 100% range, although, we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. As was alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter. Not only as we see more vaccinations, but of course the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our medical device platforms. If you take a look at vision surgery up 11%, if you take a look at our EP business up 26%, our surgery business was well up in the double-digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or endomechanical. Orthopedics particularly large joints, we saw lags slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed-bearing cementless options as well. So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement performance in our medical device sector, as we head through the remainder of the year. Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing. Hey, Joanne, this is Alex. Thank you very much for your question. Look, in Vision Care overall, we think our performance was solid. We have seen the contact lens business in the surgery business be significantly impacted over the course of 2020. We have seen gradual improvement in the back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. We think our Vision Care, our contact lens business is in very good shape. We think our share position is stable to increasing. And we think we've seen, definitely, an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comments. And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or multi-focal and contact lenses, and the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business will continue to bear out in stronger performance and share gains through the year. Regarding orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw very strong performance, for example, in our trauma business, growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are, perhaps, the most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, we're lagging somewhat. But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals and we see systems work their way through backlogs and, of course, in our business being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters. Thank you. Hey, Danielle, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for your question. We do there expect to see improving trends in our medical device arena. If we take a look at the first quarter, there was some irregularity just based upon what we are seeing with the virus on a global basis in January versus February and March. But overall, it's clear to us that we're seeing improving trends. And as Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, we would expect that just given year-on-year comps plus what we're seeing underlying both in the United States and Europe in terms of procedure scheduling, confidence in returning to the hospitals and overall surgical volumes. We would expect those to improve through the second and third quarter of this year. Thank you, Danielle. Look as Paul said, our goal remains ensuring that all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets our high-quality standards and at the same time that we secure Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at the Emergent Bayview facility. At this time, as we continue in discussions with the FDA, it is premature to speculate on any potential impact that this may have on our timing of our vaccine deliveries. So we will expect to work with the FDA, to work this inspection this -- to close this inspection this week and then we will work with the FDA and Emergent to address those inspections findings. But at this time, it would be premature to speculate on any potential impact that this could happen our delivery timing. Sure, Matt. Thanks a lot for the question. Look Matt, overall, I wouldn't read too much into just these recent results regarding a significant shift overall in our portfolio. I mean, we remain very committed and optimistic about the underlying unmet need and demand across our surgical portfolio, our orthopedics portfolio and our vision care portfolio. But as we alluded to earlier, there are some procedures that in terms of your ability to defer and how elective they truly are that may have a near-term impact on timing. So look overall, if we look at our underlying trends not only versus 2020, but as was noted earlier also versus 2019, we're seeing growth rates consistent overall with what we see for this market. We think this market has the opportunity to grow at about the 5% range over the long-term. And we've been very explicit in our goal to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. That's number one. Number two, we're actually very excited about some of the opportunities that we have for launches. I think, in total, we have more than 21 major launches lined up in our medical device business for this year. We mentioned specifically in the knee area VELYS as well as our ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing, which we think will offer us a real competitive opportunity to generate additional growth in that area. The QDOT MICRO is another great add-on in our EP business that is already growing in excess of 20%. And if you look across our EndoMech, our energy business here too we've got really nice add-on innovations as well as throughout our vision care portfolio. And of course, longer-term the significant opportunity that we see in digital surgery that team has continued to make very solid progress. And we're excited about the long-term prospects there as well. So, now overall, we see a lot of opportunity across our medical device portfolio. Sure. Well, look I -- we believe that we're in a very, very early innings of digital, Matt. And first of all, if we just look at the overall penetration rate of digital surgery, it's about 10% in the United States. It's just a couple of percent on a global basis. And so we think, if you consider the overall trends of how technology can be utilized in some of these procedures, if you take a look at our global footprint, we think we will be well positioned there in the long-term. As you mentioned our team has continued to make good progress. We said from the very beginning, look we're building this for the decades, we're not just building this for the next quarter. And we're optimistic about the progress that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that one can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that two that's differentiated; and three that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think long-term can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. And also just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. And as we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that -- all too often patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify for example lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune-type agents locally. And how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining pharma, medical device some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think, it exemplifies, kind of, our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together. Well let me end where I began, first of all, by thanking all of you for your insightful questions and your ongoing support; two and also by thanking all of our associates at Johnson & Johnson almost 140,000 who have been working 24/7, particularly, over the last 15 months during this pandemic period. We appreciate your ongoing interest and your support and look forward to updating you at our next quarterly call. Thank you very much and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe and I'm pleased to provide an update on our COVID-19 vaccine and our efforts to address the ongoing pandemic, which today has taken the lives of more than three million people globally. From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single-shot easily transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing in affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country phase 3 ENSEMBLE study that demonstrates the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, beginning day 28 of the vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus including the B.1.3.5.1 variant. Based on the robust data, we submitted to health authorities, we received emergency use authority -- authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and Emergency Use listing from the World Health Organization. We began US distribution in March with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the Sisonke study, an open-label phase 3b vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline healthcare workers in South Africa, where the B.1.3.5.1variant has become dominant and where there is limited supportive care of wide -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across the African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single-shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical tool for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. Last Tuesday, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of their vaccine in the US. ACIP will reconvene this Friday and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of their vaccine in Europe and paused vaccinations in all of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while we've updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and wellbeing of the people who use our product is our number one priority. And we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited report by healthcare professionals. We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine. And in view of the raise -- raging pandemic, that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA to work toward continuing vaccination to end the global pandemic. We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the paused in the investigator-led collaborative Sisonke study, provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- of available safety data from Sisonke study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of healthcare workers in South Africa soon. We are looking forward to the outcome of -- from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency, Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC, as it is called and are looking forward to working with EMA to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. Moving on to manufacturing, the quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with the U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. Our goal remains ensuring all drugs and drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standards and securing emergency use authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single-shot doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. In conclusion, I want to note that, COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics. Now I will turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A. Okay. Yes, let me take the first question. We are working very closely both with FDA CDC as well with EMA and the PRAC, on addressing your first question on risk and whether there will be guidance. And we'll work closely if that comes out in the course of the week to implement that globally. But also restore the confidence in the vaccine. It's an extremely rare event. We hope by making people aware as well as putting clear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines in place that we can restore the confidence in our vaccine. Yes. From the beginning, we selected BCMA CAR-T based on its double binding and that has yield a superior profile with -- in the high 90s overall response rates as well as very high MRD-negativity rates and lasting effect. And so, we think this CAR-T is very strongly positioned in the market and hope to get approval in the second half of the year. So thank you for the question on immunology. Look, I'm not going to comment on the safety of the oral JAK inhibitors. What I can tell you is that we have a very strong and robust pipeline in immunology driven by our three existing assets; Symfony, Stelara and Tremfya. Stelara and Tremfya had very strong quarters with close to 40% growth in Tremfya and 15% in Stelara. In Stelara, we continue to grow share in GI both in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And Tremfya is the first and only IL-23 that does have both indications PSA and PSO and it's continued to gain share in both areas. Moving forward, we are excited about our possibilities in immunology with our oral agents. As you mentioned one, we have two in Phase 2. One of them is a pan-JAK oral that we think could be important. We'll have to see the data. And broadly in immunology, we also are excited about the possibilities of nipocalimab, which is our FcRn antibody in pathways that are auto antibody-mediated with very rare diseases that could create a pipeline in a product. So for us, immunology remains a core area of growth and focus and we believe we are in a very strong position to continue to drive growth in the coming years, but even beyond 2025 too."

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full-year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced much like every other company in every other industry. COVID-19 cases were on the rise, worldwide lockdowns were in effect and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our lifesaving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic and our first-quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long-term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities when appropriate to create value over the long-term. Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few starting with our pharmaceutical business. First, we received US approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for Ponvory in multiple sclerosis, our first EMEA approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA Car-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma and we anticipate US approval later this year. As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the phase 2 development of Tesnatilimab, an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial. Within our medical devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for Tecnis Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years. Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect the commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name, Acuvue Ability, pending health authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients, while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline. As Chris commented to earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first-quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So, let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. Our pharmaceutical segment is on track with our expectations and in 2021, we expect to deliver a 10th consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven not dependent on price. You may have noticed that we issued our fifth annual Janssen US Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than t$29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated. In consumer health, prior-year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile, driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs. In medical devices, better execution, new innovative offerings, and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage, and unemployment rates along with the easing of mobility restrictions will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full-year outlook we had in January. Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS, already projected to grow at 18%, or 1.8 times greater than sales growth. Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please know that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted. Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales, on an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion, or 8.2% to 9.4%. While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.19, results in a still favorable, but to a lesser degree currency impact of $1.3 billion, or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9%, or 10.3 at that midpoint versus 2020. Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are however comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movement, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57 or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models. This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in medical devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in medical devices. Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome, but more importantly accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul. And Chris with respect to financial guidance, there is nothing in our future outlook with respect to that at this point in time. So we will -- when it's warranted certainly provide updates. Right now we're just commenting to what was actually experienced in the first quarter. Thanks for your question. Sure. Thanks Larry. Thanks for the question. And as usual you have all the numbers at the ready there. So I think I got them all down. But I think the real short story is that I would say, on 10% sales growth, we're going to grow earnings about 18%. And so given the early nature of the year, we challenged our leadership teams and each of our segments and across our functions to see what we can invest today to benefit the future. So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today in hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after. And that's really how we're looking at it. As we -- we have many great opportunities -- and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 million. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations, if some of those opportunities don't come to fruition, we'll certainly be happy to revise guidance upward later on this year. But right now, we thought that was the best course of action to solidify the long term. Yes. Thanks for the questions, Bob. With respect to the impact of, I'd say, COVID-19 vaccine investing, in the quarter, it was, let's call it, between $0.05 and $0.10 for the quarter. I'm not overly concerned about that because, as you heard from Paul, we are going through the rigor of the scientific reviews. It appears that there is a very path forward that we'll find out about here in the next couple of days. And we're going to do all we can to make sure that that important solution to address the global pandemic gets back into the marketplace. So, we think we'll recover that, even in the not-for-profit model. With respect to pricing and dynamics, I think you're probably correct in your initial assessment that it's a bit early. But let me turn it over to Joaquin to give you some thoughts that we have on that topic. Yes. Thanks for the follow-up Josh. You know as you can imagine, it is very fluid. But there's nothing in the guidance today that should give analysts or investors concern about any downside with respect to this. Again, we're hope -- we're cautiously hopeful that there is a very viable path forward. We'll learn a lot more in the next couple of days through the regulators. We'll let the process play out, but investors should feel very comfortable with our EPS guidance to protect against any downside that may be envisioned, although I don't see that as likely at this point. That's a good point, Chris. And I think this is going to be a choppy year so we have to look selectively at year-on-year comps. And if you just look at, let's call, what was a normal quarter at least as we knew it back in the first quarter of 2019 you look at our respective businesses. You have -- consumer is up about 8% this quarter versus first quarter of 2019. So again that suggests a strong underlying business. Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5% and medical devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison. But I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have as you heard in our commentary many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. So across all three parts of our business, I think, there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong. You couple that with the investment we continue to make in R&D at elevated levels, I would hope folks feel really good about not just our performance of today but our future performance on the horizon. Great, Louise. Thanks for the questions. I will address tax reform as best I can. Obviously that's a fluid situation. Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either. And I can give you one example in one industry and that's Johnson & Johnson where when tax reform was passed in 2017 we committed to increasing our investment in the US by 15% over the upcoming four years versus the preceding four years. We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the US over that four year period. And that's more than $30 billion. Now what does that mean in terms of the US economy? It means more jobs. I mean, we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 act. So, I think when you look at where the US sits with respect to OECD countries, right now we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit toward the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. So, I think it's something that we need a little more fact-based dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive, that the US becomes a source of innovation across all industries. And we don't floor the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year where many US-based companies have stepped up. Joaquin, let me turn it to you to -- just the other items. Yes. Maybe Terence just to pile on to what Joaquin outlined there with the strength of our pipeline. So in pharmaceuticals, specifically, we're looking at 10 new filings that could be new products or indications in 2021, 13 in 2022 and 26 in 2023. So you can see that R&D investment incrementally paying off. With respect to your second question regarding supply, I want to be respectful of the process by which the regulators are going through. We are remediating what we need to remediate. We think that will lend itself to a positive outcome and should put us in a position to meet all of our contractual commitments as they stand today. But let's be respectful of the process and let that play out. We're going to do all we can and provide that effort. As you know and as you've heard in the press we do have some of our best personnel on the -- on-site at Emergent. So they're benefiting from our expertise and we should know more in the next couple of days."

I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business. I\u2019m excited for the future of Johnson & Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson & Johnson to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This remains as true today as the day we were founded. And I\u2019m honored to continue this legacy. In 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world, as well as the breadth and diversification of our business. There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our Pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline. I\u2019m particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy; and TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. In MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential. Notably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth. This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024. Finally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation. Looking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent. First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a two-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused. In Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve our market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges. Growth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI, and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. In MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022\u2019s momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets. This will be a transformational year for Johnson & Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of our new Consumer Health Company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023 as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021. As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022. Also, we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world. Now, let me turn it back to Jess.\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Joaquin. Starting with Q4 2022 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 4.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 0.9% as currency had a negative impact of 5.3 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 11.5%. Operational sales outside the U.S. declined 1.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.4 points. Excluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide, 4.7% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedule, acquisitions and divestitures had an immaterial impact on our results in the quarter. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.77 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.35, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.5%. For the full year 2022, consolidated sales were $94.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to the full year of 2021. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.1%, with currency having a negative impact of 4.8 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales declined 0.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedules, acquisition and divestitures as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year. Net earnings for the full year 2022 were $17.9 billion and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full year 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2%. While not part of our prepared remarks for today\u2019s call, we have provided additional information and backup for our full year 2022 sales by segment, consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted income before tax by segment, which can be downloaded from our website. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion increased 1%, with an increase of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 5.8% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 6.4% and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 3.2%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cough, cold and flu season, and growth in NEUTROGENA as well as strong new product introductions in Asia Pacific and Latin America. NEUTROGENA growth contributed to the second consecutive quarter of 5% operational growth for Skin Health/Beauty. Growth across the portfolio was partially offset by continued, although reduced supply constraints in the U.S. COVID-19 impacts in China, portfolio simplification and the suspension of personal care product sales in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion decreased 7.4% with declines of 0.6% in the U.S. and 14.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales declined 2.5%, and outside the U.S., operational sales declined 4.5%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 3.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.4%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6%. Pharmaceutical growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth for the 11th consecutive year, including 7 assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA, and was partially offset by REMICADE and ZYTIGA, due to loss of exclusivity along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth, with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively. ZYTIGA sales declined 43.6% worldwide, predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. IMBRUVICA sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our immunology business, STELARA grew 6.2%, driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 4 points and 5.4 points in the U.S., respectively, as well as a favorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 460 basis points. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the U.S. as well as austerity measures in Europe and shipment timing in Asia Pacific. TREMFYA grew 12.5%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 1.4 points and 2.9 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. Q4 growth was partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 1,150 basis points, unfavorable patient mix and a challenging prior year comparison. Beginning in Q1 2023, we anticipate that CARVYKTI, currently reported in other oncology, and SPRAVATO, currently reported in other neuroscience, will meet the threshold to be separately disclosed. I\u2019ll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion decreased by 1.2%, with growth of 7.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 8.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.9%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 4.4%. Q4 growth was driven by commercial execution, strong new product introduction performance as well as COVID-19 procedure recovery in many parts of the world. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of value-based procurement, COVID resurgence in China as well as supply constraints predominantly in vision. Strong growth continued in the U.S., with dollar sales sequentially improving each quarter throughout 2022. OUS performance was adversely impacted by dynamics related to COVID-19, especially given our strong position in China. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 15.1%, driven primarily by strong new product introductions performance, commercial execution and continued market growth in electrophysiology. Abiomed sales are also reported in Interventional Solutions, and financial results were reflected as of December 22, the date the acquisition closed. Contact lens global growth of 7.7% reflects strong performance of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and market appropriate price actions. Growth was tempered by continued supply challenges. In the orthopedics franchise, digital and enabling technologies reported in spine, sports and other continued to accelerate and drive pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. For additional context, selling days had approximately a 60 basis points positive impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022. I\u2019d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related costs, unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business, inflationary pressures as well as unfavorable mix with the enterprise, with a lower portion of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 150 basis points. This represents a 9% reduction versus the prior year, driven by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year as well as proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 16.2% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was an 18.6% reduction versus the prior year, driven primarily by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year. Interest income was favorable to prior year by just over $100 million, driven by higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related exit costs, higher Consumer Health separation-related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition and lower gains on securities. As we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit cost and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company\u2019s modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by more income in higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year. Additionally, the Company benefited from onetime tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I\u2019ll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let\u2019s look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 18.6% to 22%, driven by brand marketing phasing with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19-related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023. We are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long-term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of Talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital supply solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business. Let\u2019s delve into the financials, beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged. This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced. Investment in R&D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation. Our second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved. Our third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech\u2019s presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships. Finally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we\u2019ve completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022. I\u2019ll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson & Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments. We expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance. We estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don\u2019t speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year. Regarding other items on our P&L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs. On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion for 2023. The majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements, rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to derisk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I\u2019d like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks, starting with Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower Pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S. While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery. Specific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023. In Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain. Regarding quarterly phasing, it\u2019s best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half and likely the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements. In Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA as well as continued pricing pressure. Also, we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year. In MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses. We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half. Given we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health Company. On the P&L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made. And finally, while we don\u2019t speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half. Turning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4th with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company. Consistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions. We are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022. These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one, given Johnson & Johnson\u2019s market cap. In terms of dissynergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dissynergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end of 2024. As we separate new Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019ll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a three-segment company to a two-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K. We also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI, our BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy. The potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus Tagrisso as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Early clinical data from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Starting Phase 3 clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Potential Phase 2 clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, potential Phase 3 clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug List in China, which will take effect later this year. In MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics, our digital robotic solution, Ottava, our pulsed field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed. Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for new Johnson & Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. I am now pleased to open the line for your questions. Kevin, will you please provide the listeners with instructions if they\u2019d like to ask a question?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the time this morning. Maybe a two-part question for me. I guess, Joe, first on the guidance, you mentioned it should be viewed as responsibly cautious. Just wondering any areas you\u2019d call out in terms of conservatism as we think about the year? And then, on the pipeline side, obviously, myeloma -- sorry, excuse me, myeloma an important area for you guys. Just wondering if you can confirm the timing of the CARTITUDE-4 study and what you\u2019re hoping to see from that readout? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Good morning, Terence. I\u2019ll handle the first question, and then I\u2019ll kick the question of CARTITUDE over to Joaquin. With respect to guidance, I would say, just given all the macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty, we thought this was the right approach at this point in time to come out with guidance in the ranges that we did. I wouldn\u2019t classify it as conservative per se. What I would say in terms of our outlook for the P&L, is that we\u2019re assuming a lot of carryover, quite frankly, of the inflationary impact that we had in 2022. As you can imagine, the way the accounting would work, we built inventory at higher cost in 2022. That\u2019s set on the balance sheet at year-end and will flow through mostly the first half of 2023. If there\u2019s any element of conservatism, I would say, it probably resides in the fact that we\u2019re not assuming any deflationary relief as we go throughout the year. So, we do think these costs will be at a higher level for some time. But as you saw with our fourth quarter results and really the outlook for 2023, we\u2019re doing everything we can responsibly to prioritize our top investments for the long term as well as manage costs in the interim.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. And with respect to CARTITUDE-4 and CARVYKTI, our multiple myeloma portfolio, Terence, is the most important driver of growth for our Pharmaceutical group moving forward. It\u2019s about DARZALEX continued progression in first line; CARVYKTI, our best-in-class BCMA cell therapy; the recently approved TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific; and also, we are excited about the filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. So all in all, this portfolio enables us to do something very significant, which is changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And we\u2019ll see these medicines being used in combination and in different sequences in order to achieve this treating to cure. Specifically, what you mentioned, CARTITUDE-4, which is the study that evaluates CARVYKTI in patients who have received one or three prior lines of therapy, it\u2019s very important in achieving that goal. CARTITUDE-4 is an event-driven study, and we look forward to have some results of CARTITUDE-4 in 2023. We cannot give you the specific timing because it\u2019s an event-driven study, and it will be very important in our ambition to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Your line is now live.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So, first of all, congratulations on the performance. I was hoping that you could please discuss the longer term prospects for the Pharmaceutical business. In the past, J&J has targeted $60 billion in Pharmaceutical revenue in 2025. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s still the target. And if so, what you believe consensus is under modeling because consensus is projecting sales below the $60 billion figure for 2025? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you for the question. And turning to what you mentioned, our 2025 targets. We continue to work towards accomplishing our previously stated goals of on one hand, delivering growth every single year in our Pharmaceutical group through 2025 despite of the loss of exclusivity of STELARA, at the same time, continue to advance our differentiated pipeline and achieving $60 billion in revenue by 2025. So, we continue to work towards these goals. As we have discussed multiple times, the growth by 2025 is going to be driven mainly through the strength of our currently marketed portfolio as well as new indications of this marketed portfolio. Some examples, continuous growth of DARZALEX in first line, TREMFYA, which is gaining share, both in psoriatic arthritis and in psoriasis, and we expect a readout of our IBD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s in 2023 will provide a significant additional leg of growth for TREMFYA; ERLEADA, which is now in different indications in metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer will have some readouts of studies in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2023, providing an additional leg of growth; our INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise in the U.S. as well as our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT has been affected by COVID-19, but that we expect that will continue to deliver growth. So, that is the mainstay of our growth prospects towards 2025. And I will go later about the disconnect. Then connected with that, we are also excited about our new product launches, specifically growth of SPRAVATO, growth in CARVYKTI that I just mentioned before and also TECVAYLI, which we got the approval very recently; and as I commented, the filing of Talquetamab, everything in multiple myeloma. At the same time, we continue to make significant progress in some of the key products in our pipeline. A sample of them we commented that were opportunities of more than $5 billion. Example of them, milvexian, our oral anticoagulant, the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer, our TARIS platform in bladder cancer. And finally, nipocalimab in autoantibody-mediated diseases. So, those are the key drivers of our growth moving into 2025. If I think about the main disconnect between our forecast and the Street forecast, it\u2019s our multiple myeloma portfolio. As I commented earlier, we see our multiple myeloma portfolio helping treat into cure rather than cannibalizing each other. And as a matter of fact, some of the studies that we have now in place show that ambition of combining our therapies. I mentioned CARTITUDE-4, moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy; TECVAYLI and Talquetamab, our two bispecific antibodies are being studied in combination with one another, and TECVAYLI or Talquetamab are also being a study in combination with DARZALEX. So, I see that as the major source of disconnect with the Street. Then further to that, I continue to see disconnects in SPRAVATO, our treatment for treatment-resistant depression; significant disconnects also in ERLEADA because of the indications in high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer that will read in 2023. We see a disconnect, as I commented in our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT, which have been impacted by the pandemic, but we see strong growth moving forward. And then, finally, in the expectations for Xarelto loss of exclusivity, which we see that in the back half of this decade. So, those are elements that I have reflected as disconnect. So, as I said, we continue to drive towards our 2025 goal of $60 billion and posting growth every year. I think it\u2019s a reflection of the strength of our current portfolio and how well we are executing in our pipeline.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two-part one for me. Joe, can you provide a little more color on the cadence of operational sales growth in Pharma and devices? How much lower do you expect the first half to be versus the second half? And what are you assuming for market growth in each of the segments in \u201823? And Joaquin, just to follow up to David\u2019s question there on the $60 billion, it implies a 6% CAGR between 2022 and 2025. How should we think about the ramp to $60 billion? 6% do you expect it to be more back-end loaded? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJoe Wolk: Good morning, Larry. So, let me start by -- as you know, we don\u2019t provide guidance by quarter, but let me talk a little bit about market growth. With respect to MedTech, we anticipate pretty much what we typically see in any given year, 4% to 6%. As some of my earlier comments in the prepared remarks reflect, we anticipate that there will be a little bit of, I\u2019ll call it, carryover from some of the COVID surges that we saw in the Asia Pacific region in the fourth quarter. But, other than that, a normal cadence of steady procedure recovery. The biggest challenge that hospital administrators are facing right now is really the staffing concern, but they\u2019ve done a wonderful job in getting some sense of normalcy to that. With respect to Pharmaceuticals, again, we enjoyed our 11th consecutive year of above-market growth. We anticipate 2023 will be a 12th year, but it is off of a lower base. If you happen to see some of the IQVIA data from last week, they\u2019re calling global and actually U.S. growth somewhere in that 2.5% to 4% range, depending on what region you\u2019re looking at. So, while we will beat the market, we think it will be a lower number just by the dynamic of the market overall. And that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking of it. In terms of some of the cadence, maybe to elaborate on the comments that I had prepared earlier, we will see some of that generic erosion that we experienced in the fourth quarter in Europe with the long-acting injectables as well as ZYTIGA having a much more pronounced impact in the first and second quarter, bleeding over from the fourth quarter. And pricing measures likely will be consistent throughout the year. So hopefully, that helps give you a better sense of how we\u2019re looking at it. But again, the general theme of second half stronger than first half and probably second quarter stronger than first quarter seems to hold intact based on top line as well as bottom line performance, given our expectations.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. And regarding to your question, Larry, as we have discussed and commented, we see above market growth in 2023 for our Pharmaceutical group, which would be the 12th consecutive year of our market growth. And we continue to see positive growth in 2024 despite the loss of exclusivity in STELARA. And then we would see again pick up our growth above market in 2025. That\u2019s the sequence that we will see. Certainly, the actual growth rate will be impacted by the FX and we don\u2019t anticipate and we don\u2019t project FX. And when we were establishing our $60 billion goal, we were thinking about the FX at the moment. We don\u2019t change the $60 billion because we don\u2019t know what the FX would be by 2025. But for purposes of you understanding how we see that, we see above market growth in 2023; we see positive growth in 2024; and then, we see a pickup of growth, a significant one, in 2025 above market.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just one question and one quick clarification. I guess, on operating margins, and this is a question maybe beyond \u201823. I\u2019m just trying to think through the balance of, I guess, on one hand, some of the inflation headwinds potentially decreasing as you work through some of this inventory, I guess balanced against the STELARA LOE and some of the dissynergies from the spin. So, I guess, as something kind of bigger picture about operating margins, is 2023 a decent proxy going forward, or could we see either modest erosion in margins or expansion, or is it too early to call? I\u2019m just trying to get just some sense of how that plays out. And then my second question, which is just maybe a clarification on some of the immunology comments you made regarding 4Q. I think you mentioned unfavorable mix and rebate dynamics as headwinds. Should we expect those dynamics to continue in \u201823? And I guess, are they getting worse, or is this more just a continuation of what you\u2019ve seen in the last few years that rebates are just kind of like gradually going up for that franchise as a whole? Thanks so much.\nJoe Wolk: Great. Good morning, Chris. I\u2019ll tackle the operating margin question, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Joaquin for some of the immunology references. So with respect to operating margin, I think, while we don\u2019t give multiyear guidance, I think this year does portend to have a considerable achievement in terms of managing cost by the organization in addition to inflationary pressures. And again, that\u2019s not combated with an assumption that we\u2019ll see deflationary relief. We also have the dissynergies that come along with the consumer separation itself. As the comments indicated, we plan to address all of those, and we\u2019ve already started in mid-2022 to mitigate some of those. They\u2019ll be fully mitigated by 2024. So, I would think just looking out now qualitatively, \u201823 and \u201824 may look similar because you\u2019ve got some different dynamics playing out, and we\u2019ll certainly have to see how inflation plays out over the course of this year. And then, getting back on a more normal cadence, I would say, you would expect from Johnson & Johnson, you know that we like to grow income a little bit faster than sales growth. And you do that by improving your margin profile. We have $60 billion of resources in a given year. So, we\u2019ve got a responsibility, we think, to continue looking at our prioritization, and our processes and technology to make sure that we are being not only as effective as we can be but also as efficient as we can be.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. And Chris, regarding the dynamics in the immunology market, overall, what we see is that the patient mix is changing, putting more pressure in our overall net price by having a higher participation of some channels, we are lower priced. We see those situations continuing into 2023, but not getting worse. Simply the situation that we are now will continue into 2023, but will stabilize from where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, I had just one on -- a follow-up on guidance. Joe, if you could talk a little bit about following up on some of the conservatism and maybe the bright spots, the China assumptions that you\u2019ve made for procedure disruption and maybe VBP, if you could give us a sense of how long into \u201823, you expect that to go? And then what you assume for the STELARA LOE? And then, on this sort of conservative side on the bright spot, I think you just kind of covered, I guess, the ortho trends. I understand you aim at this mid-single-digit range for performance, but you had a very, very strong back half in the U.S. And I\u2019m just wondering does that kind of strength in ortho and the spine, for example, which is kind of well above sort of historical ranges. Does that kind of continue into \u201823, or are we assuming that we went into in some comp challenges there, or how -- what sort of elements are contemplated in your guidance, that would be helpful?\nJoe Wolk: Sure. Good morning, Matt. First of all, I guess let me follow up to Terence\u2019s question with respect to how he positioned, conservatism. I probably did miss an opportunity to speak about some of the things that maybe could go better on our behalf. And some of that could be a quicker rebound in China, whether that be in both MedTech or Pharmaceuticals. Right now, we\u2019re assuming there is some carryover effect from the COVID surges we saw in the fourth quarter. The teams on the ground seem to indicate that it\u2019s still persistent, but if that rebounded a little bit quicker. I think also looking at the multiple myeloma portfolio, and the performance of CARVYKTI or TECVAYLI could be significant and opportunities or pockets for upside. We\u2019re obviously excited by the Abiomed acquisition and what that could possibly mean. And bringing the capabilities of Johnson & Johnson, both in terms of scale and reach, presents some opportunity that maybe isn\u2019t in the current projections. So, there are some opportunities for outperformance. Right now, we like where the number is at with respect to that. China and VBP specifically, I would say that is a dynamic that\u2019s not really a new phenomenon for us. We had won a number of tenders at the end of 2021 that were persistent throughout 2022, and we continue to win tenders. And we think over time that the volume and the opportunity to help many more patients will be persistent with that. So, we are -- it\u2019s part of the guidance that we see today that we\u2019ve offered today, but it\u2019s not really much more pronounced in terms of the impact it has on the business versus what we\u2019ve experienced already.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nTrung Huynh: Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Just a question on STELARA erosion expectations. So, I was hoping you can give us some thoughts about the cadence of biosimilar products that are going to be coming along this year. None are approved yet. But, can we expect the first company to enter with exclusivity for six months, something we\u2019ve seen with HUMIRA, and then the rest coming in 2\u20194? Or should we expect all the players to come at once? So, any color on this patent answer would be helpful. Thanks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you for the question. And it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on some of your topics there. There\u2019s no approved biosimilars at this time, and we are going to continue to monitor the situation. As we have commented, we expect the erosion curve of STELARA to be likely steeper than that of REMICADE, given the evolution of the biosimilar market and the fact that STELARA is a self-administered product, as well as potentially to your point, potentially interchangeability in the label. So, that\u2019s how we see the STELARA loss of exclusivity. In 2023, when we think about the STELARA in the U.S., we see the sales of STELARA flat to declining, obviously, given the price pressures. That will be offset also by continuous volume growth that we see in STELARA. So, that\u2019s the perspective that we have for STELARA in 2023. Overall, we have a very strong immunology franchise. I commented on TREMFYA before, the continuous progression in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the readout of our ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease studies, which is exciting. And also, in 2023, we may have some data from our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23, which we think it\u2019s a very exciting underappreciated opportunity in our pipeline, too.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. The multiple myeloma franchise, obviously, very central to your objective for 2025. Between the CAR-T sort of gradual launch that you have based upon supply and the bispecifics, can you talk about what that interplay has been since the approval and launch, and what you\u2019re expecting through the year in 2023? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: As far as the demand for CARVYKTI, we see very strong demand for CARVYKTI and also for TECVAYLI. There\u2019s a significant need for new therapies in this relapsed/refractory patient population. So, the demand for the products, the physicians and patient adoption has been really strong. So, that is really encouraging and pertains the unmet medical need for these types of patients. With CARVYKTI, we continue to scale our production capacity and expand our network of providers, and we are doing that in a phased approach. With TECVAYLI, we are off to a successful start and the early indications for this of the self-option are very, very positive, too, connected with the high unmet medical need that we see there. Moving into 2023, key elements of that would be, from a data perspective, the reading CARTITUDE-4, which would give us the opportunity to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Also the filing of Talquetamab, which will give us another line of therapy, because some of the studies of Talquetamab are done in patients who have failed BCMA, either cell therapy or bispecifics, and the continuous data that we\u2019ll continue to provide to guide how to use this incredible portfolio in multiple myeloma.\nJessica Moore: Sorry. Sorry, Kevin. We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Perfect. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is live now.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. So I wanted to ask you about the timing of data readouts first half or second half and your expectations for a few products. First one is nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis. And then, your oral IL-23 I saw that a trial was finished and what your next steps are here and when you might have some data? And then lastly, just on your RYBREVANT and lazertinib, are you still expecting a potential interim readout for lung cancer here? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: So, regarding the main data readouts that you could expect in 2023, I mean, I commented already on CARTITUDE-4, which is a key one for us. Again, this is an event-driven study, so it\u2019s difficult for us to give you exact timing, Louise. Importantly, we have the potential for an interim analysis on the Mariposa study, which is the study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations in this study versus Tagrisso. And this is an important study for us. And also, we have the potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study, which is in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. So, those are important ones in non-small cell lung cancer. And then, staying in oncology, we also have the data for the -- from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of our TAR-200 platform, our drug-eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. And we continue to work on our high-risk localized prostate cancer with ERLEADA. So, that\u2019s key elements in our oncology side. As far as nipocalimab, we are expecting data from our Phase 3 studies in RA, in rheumatoid arthritis, which I know has created significant attention from you and also in hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn. It will be towards the later part of the year. That\u2019s when you can expect those data to come up. And then, keeping with important date targets next year, we\u2019ll also have the data reads in our 2 IBD studies, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease with TREMFYA. Finally, important progress in our pipeline is that we will be starting our Phase 3 clinical program with milvexian, our Factor XI anticoagulant with our partners at Bristol-Myers Squibb. So, I would say, a very important year for us in terms of data read. That will also include our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23. It\u2019s difficult for us to give you an exact time line, but we fully expect that to happen in 2023. So, many important data reads for us that will showcase the good execution that we\u2019re having in our pipeline.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Louise, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions that you may have. I would now like to turn it over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: So thank you, everyone, for your questions and interest in Johnson & Johnson. While we have highlighted some of the challenges that we have in the macro environment, we think that 2023 is going to be another exciting year for innovation, for patients. And you can rely on us on delivering strong financial performance for both, the near and the long term. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19-related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023. We are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long-term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of Talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital supply solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business. Let's delve into the financials, beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged. This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced. Investment in R&D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation. Our second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved. Our third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech's presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships. Finally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we've completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022. I'll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson & Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments. We expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance. We estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year. Regarding other items on our P&L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs. On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion for 2023. The majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements, rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to derisk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks, starting with Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower Pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S. While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery. Specific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we've said, we're excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023. In Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain. Regarding quarterly phasing, it's best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half and likely the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements. In Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA as well as continued pricing pressure. Also, we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year. In MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses. We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half. Given we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health Company. On the P&L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half. Turning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4th with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company. Consistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions. We are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022. These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one, given Johnson & Johnson's market cap. In terms of dissynergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dissynergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end of 2024. As we separate new Johnson & Johnson, we'll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a three-segment company to a two-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K. We also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI, our BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy. The potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus Tagrisso as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Early clinical data from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Starting Phase 3 clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Potential Phase 2 clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, potential Phase 3 clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug List in China, which will take effect later this year. In MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics, our digital robotic solution, Ottava, our pulsed field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed. Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for new Johnson & Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. I am now pleased to open the line for your questions. Kevin, will you please provide the listeners with instructions if they'd like to ask a question? Good morning, Terence. I'll handle the first question, and then I'll kick the question of CARTITUDE over to Joaquin. With respect to guidance, I would say, just given all the macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty, we thought this was the right approach at this point in time to come out with guidance in the ranges that we did. I wouldn't classify it as conservative per se. What I would say in terms of our outlook for the P&L, is that we're assuming a lot of carryover, quite frankly, of the inflationary impact that we had in 2022. As you can imagine, the way the accounting would work, we built inventory at higher cost in 2022. That's set on the balance sheet at year-end and will flow through mostly the first half of 2023. If there's any element of conservatism, I would say, it probably resides in the fact that we're not assuming any deflationary relief as we go throughout the year. So, we do think these costs will be at a higher level for some time. But as you saw with our fourth quarter results and really the outlook for 2023, we're doing everything we can responsibly to prioritize our top investments for the long term as well as manage costs in the interim. Good morning, Larry. So, let me start by -- as you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter, but let me talk a little bit about market growth. With respect to MedTech, we anticipate pretty much what we typically see in any given year, 4% to 6%. As some of my earlier comments in the prepared remarks reflect, we anticipate that there will be a little bit of, I'll call it, carryover from some of the COVID surges that we saw in the Asia Pacific region in the fourth quarter. But, other than that, a normal cadence of steady procedure recovery. The biggest challenge that hospital administrators are facing right now is really the staffing concern, but they've done a wonderful job in getting some sense of normalcy to that. With respect to Pharmaceuticals, again, we enjoyed our 11th consecutive year of above-market growth. We anticipate 2023 will be a 12th year, but it is off of a lower base. If you happen to see some of the IQVIA data from last week, they're calling global and actually U.S. growth somewhere in that 2.5% to 4% range, depending on what region you're looking at. So, while we will beat the market, we think it will be a lower number just by the dynamic of the market overall. And that's kind of how we're thinking of it. In terms of some of the cadence, maybe to elaborate on the comments that I had prepared earlier, we will see some of that generic erosion that we experienced in the fourth quarter in Europe with the long-acting injectables as well as ZYTIGA having a much more pronounced impact in the first and second quarter, bleeding over from the fourth quarter. And pricing measures likely will be consistent throughout the year. So hopefully, that helps give you a better sense of how we're looking at it. But again, the general theme of second half stronger than first half and probably second quarter stronger than first quarter seems to hold intact based on top line as well as bottom line performance, given our expectations. Great. Good morning, Chris. I'll tackle the operating margin question, and then I'll turn it over to Joaquin for some of the immunology references. So with respect to operating margin, I think, while we don't give multiyear guidance, I think this year does portend to have a considerable achievement in terms of managing cost by the organization in addition to inflationary pressures. And again, that's not combated with an assumption that we'll see deflationary relief. We also have the dissynergies that come along with the consumer separation itself. As the comments indicated, we plan to address all of those, and we've already started in mid-2022 to mitigate some of those. They'll be fully mitigated by 2024. So, I would think just looking out now qualitatively, \u201823 and \u201824 may look similar because you've got some different dynamics playing out, and we'll certainly have to see how inflation plays out over the course of this year. And then, getting back on a more normal cadence, I would say, you would expect from Johnson & Johnson, you know that we like to grow income a little bit faster than sales growth. And you do that by improving your margin profile. We have $60 billion of resources in a given year. So, we've got a responsibility, we think, to continue looking at our prioritization, and our processes and technology to make sure that we are being not only as effective as we can be but also as efficient as we can be. Sure. Good morning, Matt. First of all, I guess let me follow up to Terence's question with respect to how he positioned, conservatism. I probably did miss an opportunity to speak about some of the things that maybe could go better on our behalf. And some of that could be a quicker rebound in China, whether that be in both MedTech or Pharmaceuticals. Right now, we're assuming there is some carryover effect from the COVID surges we saw in the fourth quarter. The teams on the ground seem to indicate that it's still persistent, but if that rebounded a little bit quicker. I think also looking at the multiple myeloma portfolio, and the performance of CARVYKTI or TECVAYLI could be significant and opportunities or pockets for upside. We're obviously excited by the Abiomed acquisition and what that could possibly mean. And bringing the capabilities of Johnson & Johnson, both in terms of scale and reach, presents some opportunity that maybe isn't in the current projections. So, there are some opportunities for outperformance. Right now, we like where the number is at with respect to that. China and VBP specifically, I would say that is a dynamic that's not really a new phenomenon for us. We had won a number of tenders at the end of 2021 that were persistent throughout 2022, and we continue to win tenders. And we think over time that the volume and the opportunity to help many more patients will be persistent with that. So, we are -- it's part of the guidance that we see today that we've offered today, but it's not really much more pronounced in terms of the impact it has on the business versus what we've experienced already."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thanks, Jess. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business. I'm excited for the future of Johnson & Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson & Johnson to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This remains as true today as the day we were founded. And I'm honored to continue this legacy. In 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world, as well as the breadth and diversification of our business. There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our Pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy; and TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. In MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential. Notably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth. This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024. Finally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation. Looking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent. First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a two-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused. In Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve our market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges. Growth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI, and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. In MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022's momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets. This will be a transformational year for Johnson & Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of our new Consumer Health Company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023 as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021. As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022. Also, we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I'm confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world. Now, let me turn it back to Jess. Thank you. And with respect to CARTITUDE-4 and CARVYKTI, our multiple myeloma portfolio, Terence, is the most important driver of growth for our Pharmaceutical group moving forward. It's about DARZALEX continued progression in first line; CARVYKTI, our best-in-class BCMA cell therapy; the recently approved TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific; and also, we are excited about the filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. So all in all, this portfolio enables us to do something very significant, which is changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And we'll see these medicines being used in combination and in different sequences in order to achieve this treating to cure. Specifically, what you mentioned, CARTITUDE-4, which is the study that evaluates CARVYKTI in patients who have received one or three prior lines of therapy, it's very important in achieving that goal. CARTITUDE-4 is an event-driven study, and we look forward to have some results of CARTITUDE-4 in 2023. We cannot give you the specific timing because it's an event-driven study, and it will be very important in our ambition to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Thank you for the question. And turning to what you mentioned, our 2025 targets. We continue to work towards accomplishing our previously stated goals of on one hand, delivering growth every single year in our Pharmaceutical group through 2025 despite of the loss of exclusivity of STELARA, at the same time, continue to advance our differentiated pipeline and achieving $60 billion in revenue by 2025. So, we continue to work towards these goals. As we have discussed multiple times, the growth by 2025 is going to be driven mainly through the strength of our currently marketed portfolio as well as new indications of this marketed portfolio. Some examples, continuous growth of DARZALEX in first line, TREMFYA, which is gaining share, both in psoriatic arthritis and in psoriasis, and we expect a readout of our IBD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's in 2023 will provide a significant additional leg of growth for TREMFYA; ERLEADA, which is now in different indications in metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer will have some readouts of studies in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2023, providing an additional leg of growth; our INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise in the U.S. as well as our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT has been affected by COVID-19, but that we expect that will continue to deliver growth. So, that is the mainstay of our growth prospects towards 2025. And I will go later about the disconnect. Then connected with that, we are also excited about our new product launches, specifically growth of SPRAVATO, growth in CARVYKTI that I just mentioned before and also TECVAYLI, which we got the approval very recently; and as I commented, the filing of Talquetamab, everything in multiple myeloma. At the same time, we continue to make significant progress in some of the key products in our pipeline. A sample of them we commented that were opportunities of more than $5 billion. Example of them, milvexian, our oral anticoagulant, the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer, our TARIS platform in bladder cancer. And finally, nipocalimab in autoantibody-mediated diseases. So, those are the key drivers of our growth moving into 2025. If I think about the main disconnect between our forecast and the Street forecast, it's our multiple myeloma portfolio. As I commented earlier, we see our multiple myeloma portfolio helping treat into cure rather than cannibalizing each other. And as a matter of fact, some of the studies that we have now in place show that ambition of combining our therapies. I mentioned CARTITUDE-4, moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy; TECVAYLI and Talquetamab, our two bispecific antibodies are being studied in combination with one another, and TECVAYLI or Talquetamab are also being a study in combination with DARZALEX. So, I see that as the major source of disconnect with the Street. Then further to that, I continue to see disconnects in SPRAVATO, our treatment for treatment-resistant depression; significant disconnects also in ERLEADA because of the indications in high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer that will read in 2023. We see a disconnect, as I commented in our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT, which have been impacted by the pandemic, but we see strong growth moving forward. And then, finally, in the expectations for Xarelto loss of exclusivity, which we see that in the back half of this decade. So, those are elements that I have reflected as disconnect. So, as I said, we continue to drive towards our 2025 goal of $60 billion and posting growth every year. I think it's a reflection of the strength of our current portfolio and how well we are executing in our pipeline. Thank you. And regarding to your question, Larry, as we have discussed and commented, we see above market growth in 2023 for our Pharmaceutical group, which would be the 12th consecutive year of our market growth. And we continue to see positive growth in 2024 despite the loss of exclusivity in STELARA. And then we would see again pick up our growth above market in 2025. That's the sequence that we will see. Certainly, the actual growth rate will be impacted by the FX and we don't anticipate and we don't project FX. And when we were establishing our $60 billion goal, we were thinking about the FX at the moment. We don't change the $60 billion because we don't know what the FX would be by 2025. But for purposes of you understanding how we see that, we see above market growth in 2023; we see positive growth in 2024; and then, we see a pickup of growth, a significant one, in 2025 above market. Thank you. And Chris, regarding the dynamics in the immunology market, overall, what we see is that the patient mix is changing, putting more pressure in our overall net price by having a higher participation of some channels, we are lower priced. We see those situations continuing into 2023, but not getting worse. Simply the situation that we are now will continue into 2023, but will stabilize from where we are. Thank you for the question. And it's difficult for us to comment on some of your topics there. There's no approved biosimilars at this time, and we are going to continue to monitor the situation. As we have commented, we expect the erosion curve of STELARA to be likely steeper than that of REMICADE, given the evolution of the biosimilar market and the fact that STELARA is a self-administered product, as well as potentially to your point, potentially interchangeability in the label. So, that's how we see the STELARA loss of exclusivity. In 2023, when we think about the STELARA in the U.S., we see the sales of STELARA flat to declining, obviously, given the price pressures. That will be offset also by continuous volume growth that we see in STELARA. So, that's the perspective that we have for STELARA in 2023. Overall, we have a very strong immunology franchise. I commented on TREMFYA before, the continuous progression in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the readout of our ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease studies, which is exciting. And also, in 2023, we may have some data from our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23, which we think it's a very exciting underappreciated opportunity in our pipeline, too. As far as the demand for CARVYKTI, we see very strong demand for CARVYKTI and also for TECVAYLI. There's a significant need for new therapies in this relapsed/refractory patient population. So, the demand for the products, the physicians and patient adoption has been really strong. So, that is really encouraging and pertains the unmet medical need for these types of patients. With CARVYKTI, we continue to scale our production capacity and expand our network of providers, and we are doing that in a phased approach. With TECVAYLI, we are off to a successful start and the early indications for this of the self-option are very, very positive, too, connected with the high unmet medical need that we see there. Moving into 2023, key elements of that would be, from a data perspective, the reading CARTITUDE-4, which would give us the opportunity to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Also the filing of Talquetamab, which will give us another line of therapy, because some of the studies of Talquetamab are done in patients who have failed BCMA, either cell therapy or bispecifics, and the continuous data that we'll continue to provide to guide how to use this incredible portfolio in multiple myeloma. So, regarding the main data readouts that you could expect in 2023, I mean, I commented already on CARTITUDE-4, which is a key one for us. Again, this is an event-driven study, so it's difficult for us to give you exact timing, Louise. Importantly, we have the potential for an interim analysis on the Mariposa study, which is the study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations in this study versus Tagrisso. And this is an important study for us. And also, we have the potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study, which is in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. So, those are important ones in non-small cell lung cancer. And then, staying in oncology, we also have the data for the -- from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of our TAR-200 platform, our drug-eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. And we continue to work on our high-risk localized prostate cancer with ERLEADA. So, that's key elements in our oncology side. As far as nipocalimab, we are expecting data from our Phase 3 studies in RA, in rheumatoid arthritis, which I know has created significant attention from you and also in hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn. It will be towards the later part of the year. That's when you can expect those data to come up. And then, keeping with important date targets next year, we'll also have the data reads in our 2 IBD studies, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease with TREMFYA. Finally, important progress in our pipeline is that we will be starting our Phase 3 clinical program with milvexian, our Factor XI anticoagulant with our partners at Bristol-Myers Squibb. So, I would say, a very important year for us in terms of data read. That will also include our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23. It's difficult for us to give you an exact time line, but we fully expect that to happen in 2023. So, many important data reads for us that will showcase the good execution that we're having in our pipeline. So thank you, everyone, for your questions and interest in Johnson & Johnson. While we have highlighted some of the challenges that we have in the macro environment, we think that 2023 is going to be another exciting year for innovation, for patients. And you can rely on us on delivering strong financial performance for both, the near and the long term. Thank you very much."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Please note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events, using the information available as of today's date, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These clients acknowledge those relationships.\nJessica Moore: Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. In addition to today's presentation and associated schedules, we will be posting the transcript of today's call as well as an Excel version of key financial schedules. I will now review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Now, let's move to the third quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.8 billion for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 1.9% versus the third quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8.1% as currency had a negative impact of 6.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 4.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 0.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.3%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 12.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.2% worldwide, 4.2% in the U.S., and 12.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.68 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55, representing decreases of 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5.8%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2021, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Continuing with the streamlined remarks shared in the prior two quarters, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 0.4%, with an increase of 2.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.7%. And outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 4.8%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases; growth in OTC due to a strong cold, cough and flu season; and OUS growth in NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to market growth and new product launches. This growth was partially offset by supply constraints in the U.S. and suspension of sales of personal care products in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion increased 2.6%, with growth of 3% in the U.S. and 2% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 9%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 16.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 9.2%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.9%; U.S. operational sales growth increased to 7%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 11.3%. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA as well as our paliperidone long-acting portfolio and was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our Oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth with increases of 38.7% and 51.2%, respectively. IMBRUVICA sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competitive pressures. In the U.S., the CLL market remains below pre-COVID levels, while in the EU results were negatively impacted by government clawbacks. Overall, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our Immunology business, TREMFYA grew 41.9%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 3.2 points and 1.7 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. STELARA growth of 8% was driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 5.2 points and 6.9 points in the U.S., respectively. Results in the quarter were partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 600 basis points on worldwide growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion increased by 2.1%, with growth of 7.7% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.1%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 8.5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.1%. Drivers for growth across MedTech include procedure recovery as well as focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products such as ENSEAL X1 devices in energy; VELYS digital solutions across our orthopedic platforms; and additional solutions, enhancing our industry-leading electrophysiology portfolio. Based on our most recent share data, we continue to enhance or sustain market share positions in the large majority of our 11 priority platforms. As a reminder, these 11 platforms each generate over $1 billion in annual sales. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter is the impact of volume based procurement in China and timing of international tenders, primarily in orthopedics and supply challenges, primarily in surgical vision. Aligned with our previously communicated expectations, MedTech operational sales grew sequentially versus the prior quarter. And for additional context, selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 170 basis points, primarily driven by unfavorable currency impact in the pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies in the MedTech and the Consumer Health businesses. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.1% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 5% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in the pharmaceutical business and increased investment across multiple franchises in the MedTech business. The other income and expense line was an expense of approximately $500 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by lower litigation expense, partially offset by losses on securities, Consumer Health separation related costs and COVID-19 vaccine related costs in the current quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.4% versus 4.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2022 tax costs incurred as part of the planned separation of the company's Consumer Health business due to the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries, a one-time special item in Q3 2021 that reduced taxable income in the quarter and unfavorable income mix. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16% versus 13.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 34.5% to 33.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and commodity inflation impact on cost of products sold. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 43.8% to 41.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins remained flat at 25.5%. Commodity inflation and increased investment in research and development were offset by supply chain efficiencies in sales, marketing and administrative leveraging. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 24.2% to 24.3%, despite inflationary pressures, driven by price actions and investment prioritization. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. As Jess just shared, we are pleased to report solid results across our business segments in the third quarter. We accelerated operational sales growth across all three segments, and we're able to meet earnings expectations despite significant inflationary impacts to input costs. This performance reflects the strength of our business and versatility of our operations despite persistent global macroeconomic challenges. Given Johnson & Johnson's 136-year history, we are no stranger to periods of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, but we have a proven track record of navigating through periods of challenge and volatility. With a diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet, we've repeatedly demonstrated our ability to deliver results in the short-term while executing against our long-term strategy, focused on improving health outcomes and access to care. Let me share a few enterprise highlights from the quarter. We continue to deploy effective strategies to provide the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients rely on in the face of supply chain pressures. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help mitigate the impact of these challenges by working with our partners to make sure we're meeting demand. We continue to invest for growth, driven by innovation, as demonstrated by the recent opening of our R&D campus in San Francisco, which will expand our R&D presence in the Bay Area. I had the pleasure of being at the opening for this campus. Seeing it in person only reinforces for me that the combination of science, technology and data analytics will be the future of medicine. We also made further progress in the separation of Kenvue, the name of the planned new Consumer Health company. In addition to announcing the name, brand, visual identity and purpose, Larry Merlo was named as the Non-Executive Chair Designate. Congratulations, Larry. Thibaut, Ashley and Jennifer will provide updates on notable events for their segments later in the call. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow in excess of $13 billion. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt for a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. Investing in innovation and R&D is our top priority. And through three quarters, we have increased our R&D investment by approximately 8% over the same period last year. In addition to investing in organic growth opportunities, our team continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and other external collaborations that would enhance our current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets, while delivering strong financial returns. In mid-September, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase of up to $5 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock. This program underscores our confidence in the business and our pipeline, while also delivering returns for our shareholders. This program, combined with our dividends, has yielded nearly $11 billion being returned to shareholders already in 2022. Moving on to full year 2022 guidance. As evidenced by the third quarter, operational sales growth across all three businesses, healthcare as well as our business continues to be rooted in strong fundamentals, despite various macroeconomic pressures. We continue to see a strengthening US dollar relative to other currencies. And as seen on this slide, inflation in the US remains at levels not experienced in decades and not unique to the US. You saw some of this impact reflected in this quarter's gross margin eroding in comparison to Q3 2021, attributable to both currency and higher input cost. Despite these pressures, we are reaffirming our operational sales and reported adjusted earnings per share midpoints and tightening the ranges. On sales, we are narrowing our base business operational sales range to $97.5 billion to $98 billion or a growth rate of 7% at the midpoint. While this full year operational sales guidance is an acceleration to our year-to-date growth, it does imply a slight deceleration when comparing to the third quarter growth, driven by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in EMEA and during the month of September. We don't speculate on currency impacts. However, using the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 0.97, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 490 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 1.8% to 2.3% compared to 2021 or $93 billion to $93.5 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L. While we were able to absorb some of the inflationary pressures this year, we are lowering our full year operating margin projection due to the impacts of inflation across most spend categories to a decline of approximately 50 basis points. Given year-to-date trends on favorable employee benefit-related items, we are increasing our other income estimates to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Regarding interest income and expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, whereby we have a higher cash balance earning at rates higher than previously anticipated, we are increasing the range of our estimate to $175 million to $200 million, of income. And finally, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% and to 15.5%. Considering these revised estimates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis of $0.03 at the midpoint. The updated range is $10.70 to $10.75 or a midpoint of $10.73, reflecting a growth rate over 2021 of 9.5%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.68 per share. As a result, and by tightening the range, our reported adjusted earnings per share is $10.02 to $10.07, which maintains the previous midpoint of $10.05. I appreciate that, many of you are turning some of your attention to 2023. We are actively finalizing our plans for next year, but allow me to provide some preliminary qualitative perspectives to consider as you develop your models. We remain confident that we'll continue to grow our pharmaceutical business every year towards our goal of $60 billion in Pharmaceutical sales by 2025, despite the STELARA LOE, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 in the US. For MedTech, we expect our investments in innovation and commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our competitiveness. At this time, we anticipate positive procedure trends with the caveats that COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and some impact from volume-based pricing in China. For Consumer Health, we are seeing the benefits of our strategic price increases, and a reduction in supply chain disruptions, although some challenges are expected to continue into 2023. We expect inflationary pressures and higher input costs to persist, and we are continuing to take actions to offset these challenges. While some inflationary pressures are improving, keep in mind that, certain products we manufacture in 2022 will be sold and flow through our P&L in 2023. As far as standing up Kenvue as an independent company, we expect to announce further details on the type of separation, as well as stand-up cost estimates, and how we are addressing stranded costs later this year or early in 2023. We remain on track to complete the separation in mid to late 2023 as indicated in the initial announcement we made in November of 2021. Finally, as previously mentioned, we don't speculate on currency movement, but utilizing the euro spot rate of last week, we estimate an unfavorable currency impact on 2023's adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.40 to $0.45 or $0.10 more than the $0.30 to $0.35 impact I referenced in July's call. 2022 has proven to be an active and unpredictable year, yet Johnson & Johnson continues to reliably meet the needs of patients while navigating the volatile global economic and operating environment. The executive committee could not be prouder of our team members across the globe for their commitment to excellence. We are continuously inspired by their dedication and unwavering focus on delivering growth for our stakeholders while staying true to our credo. I am now pleased to welcome our worldwide chairs, starting with Thibaut for Consumer Health, soon to be officially Kenvue.\nThibaut Mongon: Thank you, Joe and good morning to all of you. We are indeed very proud of the achievements we have completed so far in 2022. As we shared with you throughout the year, we told you that Consumer Health would deliver improved performance starting in the second half of the year and that is exactly what you saw with our good performance in the third quarter. Our strategy is working. Our pricing actions were realized, supply chain constraints eased, and we are also against easier prior year comparables. Our third quarter results reflect those dynamics and really demonstrate our ability to achieve results despite the macroeconomic environment that Joe referenced, and that continues to be volatile. And all of this, thanks to the strength of our brands and the quality of our teams. So, looking towards 2023 and in line with our results to-date, we do anticipate that the strength and resilience of our well-balanced portfolio, together with the consumer loyalty to our brands, will continue to position our business to perform competitively with the market. Now, regarding our future, as you just heard from Joe, we are making great strides towards the planned separation of the Consumer Health business, including our recent announcement of our new name, Kenvue. So, as you can imagine, a lot of thought and care was taken to ensure that the name was memorable, distinctive, easy to pronounce in multiple languages. We then applied our expert brand-building skills to create a brand identity that reflects our new name, but also leave space for iconic brands that touch the lives of more than a billion people around the world every day. Every element was chosen to truly represent us as a future stand-alone company with the core attributes demonstrating an association with trust, care, science, and positioning Kenvue as a modern digital-first company. We also unveiled our purpose this quarter, which is realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. And in these seven words, we reflect our heritage of caring, but also play back what the world expects of us and the role we need to fulfill in society. We indeed believe that daily self-care rituals add up over time and have a profound cumulative impact on well-being. And our work at Kenvue will be to put that power into the hands of consumers around the world. So, we're excited for the journey ahead. Now, with Larry Merlo, named as our designated nonexecutive Chair, and our teams are all focused on continuing to deliver results, while progressing towards realizing the full potential of Kenvue. And now let me hand over to Ashley.\nAshley McEvoy: Thank you, Thibaut. Well, good morning. So, last year was clearly a banner year of our new product innovation and we are continuing that momentum in 2022 with four new products -- first-in-kind new products launched just in third quarter alone. And clearly, these launches are really contributing to our enhanced competitiveness. So in quarter three, we launched our next-generation TECNIS Symfony OptiBlue. It's our latest presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens; our ACUVUE OASYS MAX contact lens; the HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter; and the OCTARAY Mapping Catheter. So to just have a quick refresh on ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX. All of us know, we live digitally intense lives, and this lens was custom designed to really meet those digitally intensive lifestyles. It builds upon our industry-leading portfolio. OASYS is ranked number one. It's the largest brand in the category, and it's unbeaten in comfort across 31 clinical trials. Moving over to our Biosense Webster business. We have a launch of our HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter. This catheter is unique. It's a one-shop balloon technology, and it enables PV isolation in 12 seconds with customized energy delivery and our one integrated 3D mapping solution. So we are already seeing the impact HELIOSTAR has resulted in an 86% freedom from documented atrial arrhythmia at 12 months. So this is our entry into the single-shot ablation. Really just a couple of the ways that our team is delivering differentiated solutions really through a focus on breakthrough science and a consistent focus on doctors' critical needs. So I'm very encouraged by the strong innovation to-date and even more excited about the potential of our pipeline to come. And when I start to think about 2023, we are very focused on our mission to make the future of health care smarter, less invasive and more personalized. You've heard me consistently say this is how we can show up in health care. We will continue, particularly in today's times, a little bit of uncertain times to prioritize programs that are strengthening our core, that are really getting us on the forefront of shaping the new frontiers and medical intervention and a consistent drumbeat of always improving our competitiveness. We know that health care has an unbelievable amount of humility, but also amazing purpose. And as Joe has mentioned, we are -- it's very clearly in a dynamic time. We're going to continue to manage through the macroeconomic factors like hospital staffing, like inflation, like supply constraints and some of the overhang of the pandemic. But we are encouraged with procedural volumes in many parts of the world. They're recovering quite nicely. Some parts of the world are still a little bit below pre-COVID levels, but we are confident in the resiliency and agility of the MedTech industry and our anticipated continued recovery across the world. So thank you, and I'm pleased to turn it over to Jennifer.\nJennifer Taubert: Thank you, Ashley, and hello, everyone. Good morning. I'd really like to start off by thanking my pharmaceutical colleagues for another strong quarter with operational growth of 9%. That was broadly based across our portfolio and our regions. As Jess noted, we continue to maximize the value of our diverse leading portfolio, delivering above-market growth with a number of key drivers: DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA, also UPTRAVI, XARELTO and our long-acting paliperidone portfolio. So, really great performance across the portfolio and throughout the globe. In addition to our strong performance, the Pharmaceutical business achieved some important milestones during the quarter, both in terms of approvals and new data readouts. So first, we're really pleased to announce our first approval globally for TECVAYLI. This is our first-in-class off the shelf bispecific antibody for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and this approval was from the European Commission. And we are on track to receive approval from the US FDA before year-end. TECVAYLI is a really important addition to our multiple myeloma portfolio, particularly for this difficult to treat patient population. Also in multiple myeloma, the final analysis from our Phase 2 GRIFFIN study of a DARZALEX based investigational quadruplet regimen was presented, really highlighting the potential benefit of adding DARZALEX to this front-light treatment regimen in multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. Separately, we received two approvals for IMBRUVICA. So European Commission approved an all-oral fixed duration treatment combination with venetoclax in frontline CLL. And the US FDA granted approval for pediatric patients with chronic graft versus host disease, marking the first pediatric approval for IMBRUVICA and making IMBRUVICA the only BTKi with 12 FDA approvals across seven indications. If we turn to solid tumors, data from our early-stage trials from our combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib were presented at WCLC. Importantly, these data demonstrated a benefit in frontline treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to data from our Phase 3 MARIPOSA study in the future. And last, in immunology, we presented new data for TREMFYA from the Phase 3b GUIDE study, which demonstrated even higher rates of complete skin clearance in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were started earlier in the course of their disease. So it bodes well for earlier treatment for TREMFYA and continued growth. As I said, I'm really proud of our pharmaceuticals team and what we accomplished in the third quarter, and I look forward to finishing the year strong. As we look ahead, with our focus on transformational medical innovation, our pipeline of current medicines, our robust pipeline of new medicines and world-class capabilities, we remain really confident in our growth expectations. The ones that we outlined at our pharmaceutical business review last November, including the fact that we expect to be a $60 billion pharmaceutical company by 2025. So thank you very much. And Jess, I'll turn it back over to you.\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Jennifer, Thibaut and Ashley. This concludes the prepared remarks portion of our earnings call. Kevin, could you please provide instructions and open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just a couple of -- just a two-parter for Joe. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on 2023 operating margin dynamics? It seems like you're seeing some modest operating margin erosion this year due to inflation. Should we be thinking about a similar step down in 2023, or is there a better ability to manage some of these inflation pressures as I guess some of these start to ease as you go through the year? And maybe a second question, just as we think about 2023, just tying some of the segment comments together, and as we think about top line, is there any reason to assume a meaningful deviation from the operational growth trends that you're seeing in 2022 as we look out to 2023? And I guess maybe specifically in that, is the STELARA LOE, a large enough of a headwind next year that we need to start to think about that impacting growth, or is that more like a 2024 and beyond issue? Thanks so much.\nJoe Wolk: Good morning Chris. Thanks for your questions. What I'll do is I'll give you some insights around 2023 op margin. And then maybe I think it might be productive to turn it over to each of the segment heads to talk about what their outlook is for 2023 in a qualitative way at this point. So for 2023 op margins, I think you have a couple of dynamics that we're facing. Clearly, the macroeconomic pressures that all industries and all companies are facing is something that we have to address as well. While healthcare is a very, very good business and more resilient than most, it's not as if we're immune to some of those dynamics. So as we finalize our plans for 2023, we will be looking at prioritizing our resource deployment to those initiatives, those projects, those services that deliver the most value for patients, which in turn is then healthy for our business. The other dynamic that's at play, Chris, and maybe why I'm a little bit hesitant to give you specific guidance at this point in time, is the separation of the Consumer Health business, so we're going through some of our plans now. We have the opportunity, as we said on prior calls, to rightsize our infrastructure for a two-segment company versus a three-segment company that we've had historically. And so we're looking at opportunities there as well. I think given the pressures from both of those fronts, we take it as our responsibility here at Johnson & Johnson's management to ensure that we mitigate those, we prioritize every dollar that we have that goes to securing our long-term future, specifically in innovation and R&D. And that's where we'll continue to focus. We know that, that has a proven track record of success when we do that, specifically when we focus on those precious few projects that matter the most. And that's what we'll continue to do in 2023. So more to come on op margins, but we will -- we're not oblivious, obviously, to the world around us, and we're going to manage those very, very effectively. Why don't I turn it over to Jennifer to maybe give an outlook on Pharmaceuticals and specifically address the impact for STELARA next year.\nJennifer Taubert: Hi, Chris. Good morning. So for 2023, we anticipate another year of above-market growth for the Pharmaceuticals group. These results, we anticipate to be driven by continued growth of our key brands like DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA, SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI. And this really coming from a combination of increased penetration as well as continued market share gains. And then we also continue -- or expect continued uptake of our new launches. So products like CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI that I just mentioned, products like Spravato, et cetera. And so while we do anticipate STELARA LOE really in that late September time frame or towards the end of the year, we believe that we've got a lot of tailwinds with our existing portfolio and our new launches to continue to have another year of above-market growth in 2023.\nJoe Wolk: Thibaut, you may want to say a few words on consumers' outlook?\nThibaut Mongon: Yes, absolutely. 2023, we expect that the world will continue to be extremely volatile, inflationary pressure, supply chain disruption, geopolitical environment and continued impact from COVID pandemic in certain parts of the world. So we -- with that in mind, we are certainly prepared to navigate this environment, thanks to the quality of our brands, the strengthening of our execution capabilities around the world. And as you referenced to innovation, we continue to play a big part in our results. Moving forward, we see that the innovation we bring to market this year are extremely well received by consumers around the world, and we expect this to continue in 2023.\nJoe Wolk: Ashley?\nAshley McEvoy: No, I would just say, consistent really building on the momentum in 2022. So for the first three quarters of the year, we're looking at near 7% growth. And so, our eyes around keeping that momentum from a demand generation on revenue next year and having a revenue number that beats the market. Clearly, in today's environment, the cost of doing business has gone up. And so, we are doing everything we can to manage and mitigate that to remain competitive from -- typically, we have one or two points of price erosion. We've actually been commanding price/mix realization in today's environment through supply chain efficiencies, admin efficiencies and some price/mix realization. We do see some of the downsides in China from VBP that we're weathering through those and earning some of those tenders going forward. But we'd like to very much keep the investment going in R&D because, as you can see in the past couple of years, it's really benefited from accelerating our growth curve.\nJoe Wolk: So, Chris, hopefully, that answers your question. But I think what you should take away is, clearly, the breadth of our portfolio, the reach of our geographic presence positions us very, very well. While STELARA is certainly a big product. I think its Johnson & Johnson's largest product ever, we're not dependent on one product alone. And so the breadth of the portfolio that exists today as well as that, which is on the come, I think, bodes extremely well for continued growth that investors have come to expect.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a nice quarter here. I have one for Ashley, one for Joe. Just Ashley, I'd love to hear your thoughts just on the macro trends impacting MedTech, a little bit more color on what you're seeing in China, some of the supply constraints and staffing shortages and how you see those playing out in Q4 and 2023? And, Joe, you've been talking about taking bolder steps in M&A. Why haven't we seen more M&A from J&J so far in 2022? And has anything changed with regard to your priorities? Thank you.\nAshley McEvoy: Sure. Thank you, Larry. So I have to, first, by giving a shout-out to the MedTech team, it was a really strong quarter of 8% and 7% year-to-date. And they just have really maniacal focus is what I would say on competitiveness and customer centricity. When we -- and Joe alluded to this, Larry, if you look at -- I'll go around the world a little bit. We are seeing procedures recovering. I think we're benefiting that, posting very strong September, but also a quarter-end of 8%. In the United States, we started to see surgical procedures tick up predominantly it did at the latter part of the quarter. We do see diagnostic procedures more in the mid-single digits, so colonoscopies as an example in quarter three. So we're expecting that to continue. Now, you'll recall that we're anniversarying Omnicron hitting kind of in the thanksgiving time frame in December, so that should be a healthy comp, but we also expect in a very focused micro surgeons in the winter surge. Europe is recovering nicely. August was a little bit of a slowdown given the holiday season, but really September picked up. Asia is in fast recovery, I would say, in India and Japan. And China is still on quarter three, recovered nicely versus quarter two, but they're still below pre-COVID levels. So we expect that bolus to continue. We are moving forward. We have a strong position in China. We have a very diversified position in China. We are moving through some of the VBP actions. That's what you saw in our Joints business, we were actually up 10% in our knees and our hips in the United States, but we had negative growth in the quarter, really due to the volume-based procurement wins on pricing actions that we'll come through that for next year. So thank you for the question, Larry.\nJoe Wolk: Yes, Larry, regarding M&A. Well, first of all, let me start with just reiterating the strong free cash flow that we have year-to-date, over $13 billion, also very proud of the fact that we've been able to distribute nearly a $11 billion to shareholders through the form of our dividend program, as well as the repurchase program that was announced just mid last month. So we feel really good on that front. But as you likely noticed in today's comments, we still hold $34 billion of cash, which positions us extremely well to continue exercising that level of capital allocation around acquisitions or significant collaborations going forward. So our priorities have not changed. In fact, maybe we're even a little bit more bullish and eager to do something. But as folks come to know us, we're not going to do anything haphazardly. We're not \u2013 the aspect of this company that is really enjoyable as being the CFO is we don't have to do anything out of desperation. We're going to find those assets that have a great strategic fit, and then make sense from a financial perspective with respect to returning to shareholders something that compensates them for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. The market is a little bit funny. The volatility actually doesn't help for a conducive M&A environment right now, because you have sellers \u2013 potential sellers holding on to 52-week highs, or all-time highs, which, quite frankly, aren't too distant in the rearview mirror. We're going to approach it with a very fundamental discounted cash flow analysis, to make sure we're bringing value forward. But the short answer to your question is our priorities have not changed. We're looking to complement the already strong portfolio you heard in the first round of responses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. So, I wanted to ask you, if you any updated thoughts on getting to that $60 billion of pharma sales by 2025. And this is all organic growth. And if it's not, where could sales go with M&A? And what areas are you seeing the best opportunities in M&A? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Hi, Louise, thanks so much for the question. So, the projections that we gave you about the $60 billion in revenue by 2025 really is all based on our current portfolio and our current pipeline, so that doesn't have anything factored in right now in terms of M&A. Anything that we did there, we would look at to be additive. When we take a look at how we're going to get there, we really believe we're going to have a compound annual growth rate of at least 5%, with growth in every year, and that includes through the STELARA LOE. We think we've got eight key brands that we'll be able to post double-digit growth through 2025. And as we take a look through our pipeline and portfolio between now and then 14 novel therapies filed with potential to exceed $1 billion, and we've got five of which we think actually have potential to exceed $5 billion, so that's products like Novavax vaccine, which is in our partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb; amivantamab and lazertinib combination, which I mentioned for non-small cell lung cancer that we've got good data coming through; nipocalimab, which is progressing really nicely through the various stages of clinical development. That's the auto antibody asset that we brought in from the Momenta acquisition. We have our TARIS platform that is progressing nicely for bladder cancer, and we have CARVYKTI. While we're still in the early stages of launching and ramping that asset, based on the strength of the data and the clinical trials remain really bullish on what CARVYKTI is going to mean for patients with multiple myeloma around the world. And so I think based on our existing assets and the continued growth, I mean if you take a look at DARZALEX and the results that we just posted quarter, 39% growth, consistent with what we've been seeing as well as growth in assets like TREMFYA, ERLEADA, et cetera. You take a look at the existing portfolio, you layer in on top of that what's coming through with the pipeline, and that's what gives us the confidence to hit that $60 billion organically. That being said, in line with Joe, we're constantly looking for ways that we can continue to augment and further build our pipeline and to do so out of a position of strength. And so predominantly, we keep our innovation engine going, bringing in things in the earlier stages, which is usually our sweet spot because we can put our R&D machinery against it as well as our terrific regulatory and commercial and market access capabilities to really build things out. But that doesn't rule out later-stage acquisitions or in-market acquisitions as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJoshua Jennings: All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to just ask Ashley and maybe Joe as well, just to comment on your thoughts on the resiliency of the medical device industry during a recession and in particularly, the Johnson & Johnson's medical device business and maybe parse out which device franchises could be more resilient, which could be less. And then a quick follow-up, just partly related with cardiology procedures thought to be more resilient during recession being -- most of them being life-saving. Any updated thoughts just on strategic rationale to build out your cardiology franchise and add to the Biosense Webster division? Thanks for taking the questions.\nAshley McEvoy: Yes. Thank you, Josh. I mean, I think -- let me start with the macro. I think the health of the end-state markets in MedTech are quite vibrant. As we've talked, there's been bumpiness because of COVID that we're still having some of that. But there is patient demand that is still yet to be met. And that's really what we're experiencing in quarter three, and we still think that will continue into 2023. And you're seeing procedures that are more insulated like the cath lab is more protected in a hospital environment. Volumes have been going quite nicely. I have to give a huge shout out to the BWI team in the US, grew near 24% growth in quarter three. So -- and we're continuing to invest, to your point, in cardiology. We have a very active program in post-field ablation and we have a clinical trial in Europe that just completed in quarter two. We're looking at a 12-month readout of that on safety and efficacy and to file this year. And we're also in clinical trial in the United States for our pulse field ablation we enrolled in May 2022. We actually think the combos are going to be quite complementary of radio frequency, coupled with pulse field ablation. But -- so that's a bit about the cath lab. We're seeing bariatric procedures, which are more elective in nature, really clearing through the backlog. The ones that tend to be laggards are things like spine and we're seeing cataract surgery at a certain point becomes less selective. And the pacesetters, if you will, are areas like stroke, like trauma that are much more less elective in nature. And then I would just say from a creating patient demand, there's been a huge initiative on behalf of Johnson & Johnson and the industry to kind of move to site to care that patients are really preferring. And those areas like ambulatory surgery centers in the United States, our team predominantly in joints as well as sports, they've grown market share 20% over the past two years in those emerging channels. In areas like Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in China with a population of 1.4 billion patients continue to grow and expand. So we're going to see some of those shifts that happened during the pandemic really start to, I think, pick up, where patients can get a sense of comfort and hopefully, we can kind of diffuse some of that, the scarcity of label into the right sites of care.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Nice quarter. Quickly to follow-up on your comments on electrophysiology, those numbers were particularly strong. Could we pull that growth apart and discuss maybe how much of it is market growth, market share stocking maybe or possibly price? And then my big picture question has to do with Ashley's comments of dealing with, I want to get the right words here. Usually, you have one to two points of mix erosion, and you're now commanding price. I want to make sure I heard that right and then understand it a bit better. Thank you.\nAshley McEvoy: Yes. No, thank you, Joanne. We always talk about BWI because it is a market leader, and yet the category still has very low penetration. Less than 12% of eligible patients are actually getting cardiac ablation. And we love this example, because we think when we think of health care, we love to kind of intercept disease before it sets in. And if you can go manage cardiac arhythmia through cardiac completion, you can really prevent a stroke. So just a huge acknowledgment of how close that team is to customers really around the world. How -- the innovation cadence, they really have many first-in-kind. And if it's not first-in-kind, their second generation will ultimately become the standard-of-care is what they've shown and just a true sense of competitiveness. So, in quarter three, BWI was up about 19%, Joanne, and as I mentioned, about 24% in the US, but 13% OUS, and very healthy growth in Europe, a very healthy growth in Asia. That is a category that, like joint, is going to go through a bit of a VBP impact in some quarters to come, but we have very differentiated innovation, and we're building kind of local on-the-ground capability to endure through those. And when I think about the state of innovation, it's just making sure that we can, from an industry penetration, take that from 12% penetration and double that. And that really is the single-minded focus of all of the innovation is to locate better lesions, deliver better lesion, make it a safer, less fluoro in the procedure, make it safer for electrophysiologists and quite frankly, scale it. There's a shortage of electrophysiologist. So we invest a lot of money on market creation. Thank you, Joanne.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nGeoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for question. Just had a few pharma ones. On the I&I market, I know you guys obviously have the STELARA LOE next year. But would you expect there to be a lot of market disruption from the flood of HUMIRA biosimilars launching before? I'm just trying to think of the indirect impact on your business. And then the second question is on your cell therapy portfolio. You guys called out CARVYKTI. Any qualitative comments you have on the commercial rollout, one more quarter in? And is there an update on the CAR-T for timing that you could provide for us? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert : Got it. Thanks so much for the question, Jeff. So if we start off with immunology. Yes, I mean the market will be experiencing a significant event, at least in the US with some competitive biosimilars coming in against other assets. We do anticipate that that will cause a bit of disruption. But when we take a look at our business and TREMFYA, so focusing on TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I think based on what this has really the first IL-23 is delivering and delivering for patients. We can anticipate that there will still be strong continued growth for that asset. We're very, very confident in our excess positions there and being able to retain that even in the face of biosimilars to other products that are launching. Also put in a plug while we're at it. I'm talking about TREMFYA that we also feel really good about how our product TREMFYA is working through the Phase 3 clinical trials for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and look forward to hopefully getting that data in through the regulatory process and launching to bring even more benefit to patients with that. So we do anticipate continued growth there. And then on CARVYKTI, we're really pleased with how the product is performing for patients and the data that we're continuing to see, maybe if I start off on CARTITUDE-4 and then I'll come back on the launch. We do anticipate CARTITUDE-4 hopefully reporting by year-end. It's an event driven trial. So we have to wait until we have all of the events. But that\u2019s currently what we're planning for now, so that everyone knows CARTITUDE-4 is our study that takes a look at CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines of therapy. We're really interested and looking forward to seeing those results. So if we take a look at the early launch for CARVYKTI, we've always talked about this being really planned and thoughtful approach to scaling it. And so we're in the process right now. We've really been working closely with the centers where we had done the clinical trials to work through the initial phases. I know everyone knows about the worldwide lentivirus shortage. We've made really good progress on that and have good line of sight to that not being something that we're dependent, that not being a rate-limiting factor in the future. We're also working towards really being able to scale this at a broad level to be able to accommodate what we're seeing is both great demand for the product right now, but also what we anticipate with CARTITUDE-4, as well as hopefully with CARTITUDE-5, which would be in frontline therapy. So we reconfirm this as really a big asset with a lot of growth potential and one of our potentially $5 billion-plus brands.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Geoff. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks so much. Maybe a couple of pharma ones for me as well. I was just wondering, as you think about the combined franchise for STELARA and TREMFYA next year, can that grow versus this year? And then based on clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like the nipocalimab Phase 2 RA trial recently completed. So just wondering if you can provide any color if you're going to advance that into a Phase 3 trial for RA? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Thanks, Terry. So first question. So STELARA and TREMFYA, we're not -- we don't provide guidance by product or combinations of that. What I can say is that we do anticipate continued robust growth TREMFYA. Next year, as I indicated, TREMFYA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is really showing very strong market share gains and penetration in that market. STELARA really competes, and its strong growth has been in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And so when you take a look at those two markets, we do anticipate both of those continuing to show really good growth, at least through the first three quarters of next year with STELARA, then post September being impacted by biosimilars. And then on nipocalimab, so I don't have really to share there yet for nipocalimab. Consistent with all of our processes when we finish our studies, we go ahead and submit them to major medical meetings and get them published. I remain really confident in nipocalimab as an asset, and we've really taken a look at, at building that out across 10 or 11 different indications, including the potential for RA, which we think could be a big one. So definitely more to come on that as we can share it.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Terence, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I would now like to hand it over to Joe for some closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJoe Wolk: Great. Thanks, Jess. Thank you, Thibaut, Ashley, Jennifer and Jess, for participating in today's call. And as Jess said, thanks to all of you for your time today. Hopefully, you saw with our third quarter performance, the strength of Johnson & Johnson across all of our segments and our collective ability to manage macroeconomic headwinds as well as the unfavorable impact from a stronger US dollar. We certainly take seriously our responsibility to be a reliable, strong investment in many ways for shareholders even though uncertainty may be high. Have a great day, and we look forward to our next conversation.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thibaut Mongon",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe and good morning to all of you. We are indeed very proud of the achievements we have completed so far in 2022. As we shared with you throughout the year, we told you that Consumer Health would deliver improved performance starting in the second half of the year and that is exactly what you saw with our good performance in the third quarter. Our strategy is working. Our pricing actions were realized, supply chain constraints eased, and we are also against easier prior year comparables. Our third quarter results reflect those dynamics and really demonstrate our ability to achieve results despite the macroeconomic environment that Joe referenced, and that continues to be volatile. And all of this, thanks to the strength of our brands and the quality of our teams. So, looking towards 2023 and in line with our results to-date, we do anticipate that the strength and resilience of our well-balanced portfolio, together with the consumer loyalty to our brands, will continue to position our business to perform competitively with the market. Now, regarding our future, as you just heard from Joe, we are making great strides towards the planned separation of the Consumer Health business, including our recent announcement of our new name, Kenvue. So, as you can imagine, a lot of thought and care was taken to ensure that the name was memorable, distinctive, easy to pronounce in multiple languages. We then applied our expert brand-building skills to create a brand identity that reflects our new name, but also leave space for iconic brands that touch the lives of more than a billion people around the world every day. Every element was chosen to truly represent us as a future stand-alone company with the core attributes demonstrating an association with trust, care, science, and positioning Kenvue as a modern digital-first company. We also unveiled our purpose this quarter, which is realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. And in these seven words, we reflect our heritage of caring, but also play back what the world expects of us and the role we need to fulfill in society. We indeed believe that daily self-care rituals add up over time and have a profound cumulative impact on well-being. And our work at Kenvue will be to put that power into the hands of consumers around the world. So, we're excited for the journey ahead. Now, with Larry Merlo, named as our designated nonexecutive Chair, and our teams are all focused on continuing to deliver results, while progressing towards realizing the full potential of Kenvue. And now let me hand over to Ashley. Yes, absolutely. 2023, we expect that the world will continue to be extremely volatile, inflationary pressure, supply chain disruption, geopolitical environment and continued impact from COVID pandemic in certain parts of the world. So we -- with that in mind, we are certainly prepared to navigate this environment, thanks to the quality of our brands, the strengthening of our execution capabilities around the world. And as you referenced to innovation, we continue to play a big part in our results. Moving forward, we see that the innovation we bring to market this year are extremely well received by consumers around the world, and we expect this to continue in 2023."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ashley McEvoy",
            "content": "Thank you, Thibaut. Well, good morning. So, last year was clearly a banner year of our new product innovation and we are continuing that momentum in 2022 with four new products -- first-in-kind new products launched just in third quarter alone. And clearly, these launches are really contributing to our enhanced competitiveness. So in quarter three, we launched our next-generation TECNIS Symfony OptiBlue. It's our latest presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens; our ACUVUE OASYS MAX contact lens; the HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter; and the OCTARAY Mapping Catheter. So to just have a quick refresh on ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX. All of us know, we live digitally intense lives, and this lens was custom designed to really meet those digitally intensive lifestyles. It builds upon our industry-leading portfolio. OASYS is ranked number one. It's the largest brand in the category, and it's unbeaten in comfort across 31 clinical trials. Moving over to our Biosense Webster business. We have a launch of our HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter. This catheter is unique. It's a one-shop balloon technology, and it enables PV isolation in 12 seconds with customized energy delivery and our one integrated 3D mapping solution. So we are already seeing the impact HELIOSTAR has resulted in an 86% freedom from documented atrial arrhythmia at 12 months. So this is our entry into the single-shot ablation. Really just a couple of the ways that our team is delivering differentiated solutions really through a focus on breakthrough science and a consistent focus on doctors' critical needs. So I'm very encouraged by the strong innovation to-date and even more excited about the potential of our pipeline to come. And when I start to think about 2023, we are very focused on our mission to make the future of health care smarter, less invasive and more personalized. You've heard me consistently say this is how we can show up in health care. We will continue, particularly in today's times, a little bit of uncertain times to prioritize programs that are strengthening our core, that are really getting us on the forefront of shaping the new frontiers and medical intervention and a consistent drumbeat of always improving our competitiveness. We know that health care has an unbelievable amount of humility, but also amazing purpose. And as Joe has mentioned, we are -- it's very clearly in a dynamic time. We're going to continue to manage through the macroeconomic factors like hospital staffing, like inflation, like supply constraints and some of the overhang of the pandemic. But we are encouraged with procedural volumes in many parts of the world. They're recovering quite nicely. Some parts of the world are still a little bit below pre-COVID levels, but we are confident in the resiliency and agility of the MedTech industry and our anticipated continued recovery across the world. So thank you, and I'm pleased to turn it over to Jennifer. No, I would just say, consistent really building on the momentum in 2022. So for the first three quarters of the year, we're looking at near 7% growth. And so, our eyes around keeping that momentum from a demand generation on revenue next year and having a revenue number that beats the market. Clearly, in today's environment, the cost of doing business has gone up. And so, we are doing everything we can to manage and mitigate that to remain competitive from -- typically, we have one or two points of price erosion. We've actually been commanding price/mix realization in today's environment through supply chain efficiencies, admin efficiencies and some price/mix realization. We do see some of the downsides in China from VBP that we're weathering through those and earning some of those tenders going forward. But we'd like to very much keep the investment going in R&D because, as you can see in the past couple of years, it's really benefited from accelerating our growth curve. Sure. Thank you, Larry. So I have to, first, by giving a shout-out to the MedTech team, it was a really strong quarter of 8% and 7% year-to-date. And they just have really maniacal focus is what I would say on competitiveness and customer centricity. When we -- and Joe alluded to this, Larry, if you look at -- I'll go around the world a little bit. We are seeing procedures recovering. I think we're benefiting that, posting very strong September, but also a quarter-end of 8%. In the United States, we started to see surgical procedures tick up predominantly it did at the latter part of the quarter. We do see diagnostic procedures more in the mid-single digits, so colonoscopies as an example in quarter three. So we're expecting that to continue. Now, you'll recall that we're anniversarying Omnicron hitting kind of in the thanksgiving time frame in December, so that should be a healthy comp, but we also expect in a very focused micro surgeons in the winter surge. Europe is recovering nicely. August was a little bit of a slowdown given the holiday season, but really September picked up. Asia is in fast recovery, I would say, in India and Japan. And China is still on quarter three, recovered nicely versus quarter two, but they're still below pre-COVID levels. So we expect that bolus to continue. We are moving forward. We have a strong position in China. We have a very diversified position in China. We are moving through some of the VBP actions. That's what you saw in our Joints business, we were actually up 10% in our knees and our hips in the United States, but we had negative growth in the quarter, really due to the volume-based procurement wins on pricing actions that we'll come through that for next year. So thank you for the question, Larry. Yes. Thank you, Josh. I mean, I think -- let me start with the macro. I think the health of the end-state markets in MedTech are quite vibrant. As we've talked, there's been bumpiness because of COVID that we're still having some of that. But there is patient demand that is still yet to be met. And that's really what we're experiencing in quarter three, and we still think that will continue into 2023. And you're seeing procedures that are more insulated like the cath lab is more protected in a hospital environment. Volumes have been going quite nicely. I have to give a huge shout out to the BWI team in the US, grew near 24% growth in quarter three. So -- and we're continuing to invest, to your point, in cardiology. We have a very active program in post-field ablation and we have a clinical trial in Europe that just completed in quarter two. We're looking at a 12-month readout of that on safety and efficacy and to file this year. And we're also in clinical trial in the United States for our pulse field ablation we enrolled in May 2022. We actually think the combos are going to be quite complementary of radio frequency, coupled with pulse field ablation. But -- so that's a bit about the cath lab. We're seeing bariatric procedures, which are more elective in nature, really clearing through the backlog. The ones that tend to be laggards are things like spine and we're seeing cataract surgery at a certain point becomes less selective. And the pacesetters, if you will, are areas like stroke, like trauma that are much more less elective in nature. And then I would just say from a creating patient demand, there's been a huge initiative on behalf of Johnson & Johnson and the industry to kind of move to site to care that patients are really preferring. And those areas like ambulatory surgery centers in the United States, our team predominantly in joints as well as sports, they've grown market share 20% over the past two years in those emerging channels. In areas like Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in China with a population of 1.4 billion patients continue to grow and expand. So we're going to see some of those shifts that happened during the pandemic really start to, I think, pick up, where patients can get a sense of comfort and hopefully, we can kind of diffuse some of that, the scarcity of label into the right sites of care. Yes. No, thank you, Joanne. We always talk about BWI because it is a market leader, and yet the category still has very low penetration. Less than 12% of eligible patients are actually getting cardiac ablation. And we love this example, because we think when we think of health care, we love to kind of intercept disease before it sets in. And if you can go manage cardiac arhythmia through cardiac completion, you can really prevent a stroke. So just a huge acknowledgment of how close that team is to customers really around the world. How -- the innovation cadence, they really have many first-in-kind. And if it's not first-in-kind, their second generation will ultimately become the standard-of-care is what they've shown and just a true sense of competitiveness. So, in quarter three, BWI was up about 19%, Joanne, and as I mentioned, about 24% in the US, but 13% OUS, and very healthy growth in Europe, a very healthy growth in Asia. That is a category that, like joint, is going to go through a bit of a VBP impact in some quarters to come, but we have very differentiated innovation, and we're building kind of local on-the-ground capability to endure through those. And when I think about the state of innovation, it's just making sure that we can, from an industry penetration, take that from 12% penetration and double that. And that really is the single-minded focus of all of the innovation is to locate better lesions, deliver better lesion, make it a safer, less fluoro in the procedure, make it safer for electrophysiologists and quite frankly, scale it. There's a shortage of electrophysiologist. So we invest a lot of money on market creation. Thank you, Joanne."

            "name": "Jennifer Taubert",
            "content": "Thank you, Ashley, and hello, everyone. Good morning. I'd really like to start off by thanking my pharmaceutical colleagues for another strong quarter with operational growth of 9%. That was broadly based across our portfolio and our regions. As Jess noted, we continue to maximize the value of our diverse leading portfolio, delivering above-market growth with a number of key drivers: DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA, also UPTRAVI, XARELTO and our long-acting paliperidone portfolio. So, really great performance across the portfolio and throughout the globe. In addition to our strong performance, the Pharmaceutical business achieved some important milestones during the quarter, both in terms of approvals and new data readouts. So first, we're really pleased to announce our first approval globally for TECVAYLI. This is our first-in-class off the shelf bispecific antibody for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and this approval was from the European Commission. And we are on track to receive approval from the US FDA before year-end. TECVAYLI is a really important addition to our multiple myeloma portfolio, particularly for this difficult to treat patient population. Also in multiple myeloma, the final analysis from our Phase 2 GRIFFIN study of a DARZALEX based investigational quadruplet regimen was presented, really highlighting the potential benefit of adding DARZALEX to this front-light treatment regimen in multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. Separately, we received two approvals for IMBRUVICA. So European Commission approved an all-oral fixed duration treatment combination with venetoclax in frontline CLL. And the US FDA granted approval for pediatric patients with chronic graft versus host disease, marking the first pediatric approval for IMBRUVICA and making IMBRUVICA the only BTKi with 12 FDA approvals across seven indications. If we turn to solid tumors, data from our early-stage trials from our combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib were presented at WCLC. Importantly, these data demonstrated a benefit in frontline treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to data from our Phase 3 MARIPOSA study in the future. And last, in immunology, we presented new data for TREMFYA from the Phase 3b GUIDE study, which demonstrated even higher rates of complete skin clearance in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were started earlier in the course of their disease. So it bodes well for earlier treatment for TREMFYA and continued growth. As I said, I'm really proud of our pharmaceuticals team and what we accomplished in the third quarter, and I look forward to finishing the year strong. As we look ahead, with our focus on transformational medical innovation, our pipeline of current medicines, our robust pipeline of new medicines and world-class capabilities, we remain really confident in our growth expectations. The ones that we outlined at our pharmaceutical business review last November, including the fact that we expect to be a $60 billion pharmaceutical company by 2025. So thank you very much. And Jess, I'll turn it back over to you. Hi, Chris. Good morning. So for 2023, we anticipate another year of above-market growth for the Pharmaceuticals group. These results, we anticipate to be driven by continued growth of our key brands like DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA, SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI. And this really coming from a combination of increased penetration as well as continued market share gains. And then we also continue -- or expect continued uptake of our new launches. So products like CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI that I just mentioned, products like Spravato, et cetera. And so while we do anticipate STELARA LOE really in that late September time frame or towards the end of the year, we believe that we've got a lot of tailwinds with our existing portfolio and our new launches to continue to have another year of above-market growth in 2023. Hi, Louise, thanks so much for the question. So, the projections that we gave you about the $60 billion in revenue by 2025 really is all based on our current portfolio and our current pipeline, so that doesn't have anything factored in right now in terms of M&A. Anything that we did there, we would look at to be additive. When we take a look at how we're going to get there, we really believe we're going to have a compound annual growth rate of at least 5%, with growth in every year, and that includes through the STELARA LOE. We think we've got eight key brands that we'll be able to post double-digit growth through 2025. And as we take a look through our pipeline and portfolio between now and then 14 novel therapies filed with potential to exceed $1 billion, and we've got five of which we think actually have potential to exceed $5 billion, so that's products like Novavax vaccine, which is in our partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb; amivantamab and lazertinib combination, which I mentioned for non-small cell lung cancer that we've got good data coming through; nipocalimab, which is progressing really nicely through the various stages of clinical development. That's the auto antibody asset that we brought in from the Momenta acquisition. We have our TARIS platform that is progressing nicely for bladder cancer, and we have CARVYKTI. While we're still in the early stages of launching and ramping that asset, based on the strength of the data and the clinical trials remain really bullish on what CARVYKTI is going to mean for patients with multiple myeloma around the world. And so I think based on our existing assets and the continued growth, I mean if you take a look at DARZALEX and the results that we just posted quarter, 39% growth, consistent with what we've been seeing as well as growth in assets like TREMFYA, ERLEADA, et cetera. You take a look at the existing portfolio, you layer in on top of that what's coming through with the pipeline, and that's what gives us the confidence to hit that $60 billion organically. That being said, in line with Joe, we're constantly looking for ways that we can continue to augment and further build our pipeline and to do so out of a position of strength. And so predominantly, we keep our innovation engine going, bringing in things in the earlier stages, which is usually our sweet spot because we can put our R&D machinery against it as well as our terrific regulatory and commercial and market access capabilities to really build things out. But that doesn't rule out later-stage acquisitions or in-market acquisitions as well. Got it. Thanks so much for the question, Jeff. So if we start off with immunology. Yes, I mean the market will be experiencing a significant event, at least in the US with some competitive biosimilars coming in against other assets. We do anticipate that that will cause a bit of disruption. But when we take a look at our business and TREMFYA, so focusing on TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I think based on what this has really the first IL-23 is delivering and delivering for patients. We can anticipate that there will still be strong continued growth for that asset. We're very, very confident in our excess positions there and being able to retain that even in the face of biosimilars to other products that are launching. Also put in a plug while we're at it. I'm talking about TREMFYA that we also feel really good about how our product TREMFYA is working through the Phase 3 clinical trials for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and look forward to hopefully getting that data in through the regulatory process and launching to bring even more benefit to patients with that.

And so when you take a look at those two markets, we do anticipate both of those continuing to show really good growth, at least through the first three quarters of next year with STELARA, then post September being impacted by biosimilars. And then on nipocalimab, so I don't have really to share there yet for nipocalimab.

            "content": "Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. As Jess just shared, we are pleased to report solid results across our business segments in the third quarter. We accelerated operational sales growth across all three segments, and we're able to meet earnings expectations despite significant inflationary impacts to input costs. This performance reflects the strength of our business and versatility of our operations despite persistent global macroeconomic challenges. Given Johnson & Johnson's 136-year history, we are no stranger to periods of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, but we have a proven track record of navigating through periods of challenge and volatility. With a diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet, we've repeatedly demonstrated our ability to deliver results in the short-term while executing against our long-term strategy, focused on improving health outcomes and access to care. Let me share a few enterprise highlights from the quarter. We continue to deploy effective strategies to provide the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients rely on in the face of supply chain pressures. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help mitigate the impact of these challenges by working with our partners to make sure we're meeting demand. We continue to invest for growth, driven by innovation, as demonstrated by the recent opening of our R&D campus in San Francisco, which will expand our R&D presence in the Bay Area. I had the pleasure of being at the opening for this campus. Seeing it in person only reinforces for me that the combination of science, technology and data analytics will be the future of medicine. We also made further progress in the separation of Kenvue, the name of the planned new Consumer Health company. In addition to announcing the name, brand, visual identity and purpose, Larry Merlo was named as the Non-Executive Chair Designate. Congratulations, Larry. Thibaut, Ashley and Jennifer will provide updates on notable events for their segments later in the call. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow in excess of $13 billion. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt for a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. Investing in innovation and R&D is our top priority. And through three quarters, we have increased our R&D investment by approximately 8% over the same period last year. In addition to investing in organic growth opportunities, our team continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and other external collaborations that would enhance our current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets, while delivering strong financial returns. In mid-September, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase of up to $5 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock. This program underscores our confidence in the business and our pipeline, while also delivering returns for our shareholders. This program, combined with our dividends, has yielded nearly $11 billion being returned to shareholders already in 2022. Moving on to full year 2022 guidance. As evidenced by the third quarter, operational sales growth across all three businesses, healthcare as well as our business continues to be rooted in strong fundamentals, despite various macroeconomic pressures. We continue to see a strengthening US dollar relative to other currencies. And as seen on this slide, inflation in the US remains at levels not experienced in decades and not unique to the US. You saw some of this impact reflected in this quarter's gross margin eroding in comparison to Q3 2021, attributable to both currency and higher input cost. Despite these pressures, we are reaffirming our operational sales and reported adjusted earnings per share midpoints and tightening the ranges. On sales, we are narrowing our base business operational sales range to $97.5 billion to $98 billion or a growth rate of 7% at the midpoint. While this full year operational sales guidance is an acceleration to our year-to-date growth, it does imply a slight deceleration when comparing to the third quarter growth, driven by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in EMEA and during the month of September. We don't speculate on currency impacts. However, using the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 0.97, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 490 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 1.8% to 2.3% compared to 2021 or $93 billion to $93.5 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L. While we were able to absorb some of the inflationary pressures this year, we are lowering our full year operating margin projection due to the impacts of inflation across most spend categories to a decline of approximately 50 basis points. Given year-to-date trends on favorable employee benefit-related items, we are increasing our other income estimates to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Regarding interest income and expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, whereby we have a higher cash balance earning at rates higher than previously anticipated, we are increasing the range of our estimate to $175 million to $200 million, of income. And finally, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% and to 15.5%. Considering these revised estimates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis of $0.03 at the midpoint. The updated range is $10.70 to $10.75 or a midpoint of $10.73, reflecting a growth rate over 2021 of 9.5%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.68 per share. As a result, and by tightening the range, our reported adjusted earnings per share is $10.02 to $10.07, which maintains the previous midpoint of $10.05. I appreciate that, many of you are turning some of your attention to 2023. We are actively finalizing our plans for next year, but allow me to provide some preliminary qualitative perspectives to consider as you develop your models. We remain confident that we'll continue to grow our pharmaceutical business every year towards our goal of $60 billion in Pharmaceutical sales by 2025, despite the STELARA LOE, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 in the US. For MedTech, we expect our investments in innovation and commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our competitiveness. At this time, we anticipate positive procedure trends with the caveats that COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and some impact from volume-based pricing in China. For Consumer Health, we are seeing the benefits of our strategic price increases, and a reduction in supply chain disruptions, although some challenges are expected to continue into 2023. We expect inflationary pressures and higher input costs to persist, and we are continuing to take actions to offset these challenges. While some inflationary pressures are improving, keep in mind that, certain products we manufacture in 2022 will be sold and flow through our P&L in 2023. As far as standing up Kenvue as an independent company, we expect to announce further details on the type of separation, as well as stand-up cost estimates, and how we are addressing stranded costs later this year or early in 2023. We remain on track to complete the separation in mid to late 2023 as indicated in the initial announcement we made in November of 2021. Finally, as previously mentioned, we don't speculate on currency movement, but utilizing the euro spot rate of last week, we estimate an unfavorable currency impact on 2023's adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.40 to $0.45 or $0.10 more than the $0.30 to $0.35 impact I referenced in July's call. 2022 has proven to be an active and unpredictable year, yet Johnson & Johnson continues to reliably meet the needs of patients while navigating the volatile global economic and operating environment. The executive committee could not be prouder of our team members across the globe for their commitment to excellence. We are continuously inspired by their dedication and unwavering focus on delivering growth for our stakeholders while staying true to our credo. I am now pleased to welcome our worldwide chairs, starting with Thibaut for Consumer Health, soon to be officially Kenvue. Good morning Chris. Thanks for your questions. What I'll do is I'll give you some insights around 2023 op margin. And then maybe I think it might be productive to turn it over to each of the segment heads to talk about what their outlook is for 2023 in a qualitative way at this point. So for 2023 op margins, I think you have a couple of dynamics that we're facing. Clearly, the macroeconomic pressures that all industries and all companies are facing is something that we have to address as well. While healthcare is a very, very good business and more resilient than most, it's not as if we're immune to some of those dynamics. So as we finalize our plans for 2023, we will be looking at prioritizing our resource deployment to those initiatives, those projects, those services that deliver the most value for patients, which in turn is then healthy for our business. The other dynamic that's at play, Chris, and maybe why I'm a little bit hesitant to give you specific guidance at this point in time, is the separation of the Consumer Health business, so we're going through some of our plans now. We have the opportunity, as we said on prior calls, to rightsize our infrastructure for a two-segment company versus a three-segment company that we've had historically. And so we're looking at opportunities there as well. I think given the pressures from both of those fronts, we take it as our responsibility here at Johnson & Johnson's management to ensure that we mitigate those, we prioritize every dollar that we have that goes to securing our long-term future, specifically in innovation and R&D. And that's where we'll continue to focus. We know that, that has a proven track record of success when we do that, specifically when we focus on those precious few projects that matter the most. And that's what we'll continue to do in 2023. So more to come on op margins, but we will -- we're not oblivious, obviously, to the world around us, and we're going to manage those very, very effectively. Why don't I turn it over to Jennifer to maybe give an outlook on Pharmaceuticals and specifically address the impact for STELARA next year. Thibaut, you may want to say a few words on consumers' outlook? Ashley? So, Chris, hopefully, that answers your question. But I think what you should take away is, clearly, the breadth of our portfolio, the reach of our geographic presence positions us very, very well. While STELARA is certainly a big product. I think its Johnson & Johnson's largest product ever, we're not dependent on one product alone. And so the breadth of the portfolio that exists today as well as that, which is on the come, I think, bodes extremely well for continued growth that investors have come to expect. Yes, Larry, regarding M&A. Well, first of all, let me start with just reiterating the strong free cash flow that we have year-to-date, over $13 billion, also very proud of the fact that we've been able to distribute nearly a $11 billion to shareholders through the form of our dividend program, as well as the repurchase program that was announced just mid last month. So we feel really good on that front. But as you likely noticed in today's comments, we still hold $34 billion of cash, which positions us extremely well to continue exercising that level of capital allocation around acquisitions or significant collaborations going forward. So our priorities have not changed. In fact, maybe we're even a little bit more bullish and eager to do something. But as folks come to know us, we're not going to do anything haphazardly. We're not \u2013 the aspect of this company that is really enjoyable as being the CFO is we don't have to do anything out of desperation. We're going to find those assets that have a great strategic fit, and then make sense from a financial perspective with respect to returning to shareholders something that compensates them for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. The market is a little bit funny. The volatility actually doesn't help for a conducive M&A environment right now, because you have sellers \u2013 potential sellers holding on to 52-week highs, or all-time highs, which, quite frankly, aren't too distant in the rearview mirror. We're going to approach it with a very fundamental discounted cash flow analysis, to make sure we're bringing value forward. But the short answer to your question is our priorities have not changed. We're looking to complement the already strong portfolio you heard in the first round of responses."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJessica Moore: Please note that today\u2019s meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company\u2019s future financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company\u2019s consumer health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today\u2019s date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC\u2019s website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These slides acknowledge those relationships.\nJoaquin Duato: Good morning, everyone. This is Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thanks for joining us today. I am accompanied by Joe Wolk and Jessica Moore and we have the privilege to share our second quarter financial results and answer questions you have regarding Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business. During my first 6 months as CEO, I have had the opportunity to reconnect in person with colleagues, customers and stakeholders around the world. These conversations have energized me about the future of Johnson & Johnson. They have also made clear the critical role our company plays as a leader in bringing innovative healthcare solutions to patients and customers both today and long into the future. And they further validated that the three strategic priorities I outlined earlier this year will continue to guide us in 2022 as we deliver on our mission to transform the future of human health. Let me remind you of those priorities. First, we will continue to advance our industry leading success in pharmaceuticals by delivering the innovative pipeline we highlighted at our pharmaceutical business review last November. This includes our goal to grow this sector to $60 billion by 2025, with growth in every year, including years facing the STELARA loss of exclusivity and continuing to deliver above-market compounded annual growth of at least 5%. In the second quarter, we saw evidence of this plan coming to fruition with the launch of CARVYKTI in April. And in May, we received conditional marketing authorization in Europe. In addition, talquetamab was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in June. I have great confidence in the strength of our current portfolio, which remains underappreciated, and in our robust pipeline to meet our long-term goals and to deliver transformational medicines that help improve and save lives. Our second priority, continue to strengthen our performance in MedTech. Over the past several years, this acceleration in performance has been driven by the delivery of differentiated solutions as well as improved commercial execution. We expect this improvement to continue, enabled by our innovative pipeline as well as the potential for expansion into higher growth market segments. Currently, 11 MedTech platforms each delivered over $1 billion in revenue annually. And based on the most recent results, we are gaining or holding share in nearly all of these. With the positive momentum in this business and our improvement in competitiveness, MedTech has delivered 6% adjusted operational growth in the first half of 2022. We believe MedTech will continue to be a significant source of value for our investors and our stakeholders. Third, we are separating our Consumer Health business to create two market leading standalone companies. This separation can be a significant opportunity for value creation. The two new global entities will be well positioned to thrive in their respective markets and drive greater strategic and financial success. We are making excellent progress and remain on track to complete the separation in 2023. In the second quarter, we announced the global leadership team for the new Consumer Health organization led by Thibaut Mongon as CEO designate and Paul Ruh as CFO designate. Having worked with both Thibaut and Paul for many years, I am confident we have selected the right leadership team to lead the new Consumer Health company in its next chapter. The new Johnson & Johnson comprising our pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses will remain the largest, most diversified healthcare products company in the world, with over $80 billion in sales. With enhanced operational focus, the new Johnson & Johnson will be poised to bring integrated, comprehensive, disease-centric technology and innovative solutions to enhance patient care. Our balance sheet will remain strong, allowing us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities in higher growth markets across both segments, while maintaining our strong dividend distribution. With these clear priorities in place, we are confident in our ability to execute on both our short-term and long-term objectives. We are very pleased to have delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first half of 2022, reporting adjusted operational sales and EPS growth of 8% and 8.5% respectively. Joe and Jess will share details reflecting above-market adjusted operational sales growth from pharmaceuticals and continued resiliency in both MedTech and Consumer Health results that stand out given the current global macroeconomic challenges. We are well positioned across the globe to sustain our leadership position in healthcare. We aspire to accelerate growth, while maintaining the diversification in our business and our discipline around capital allocation, which have been foundational to our success for over the past 135 years. I look forward to addressing your questions soon. But for now, I will turn the call over to Jessica Moore to discuss those details. Jess?\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Joaquin. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional material, including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. We continue to implement enhancements in order to assist you in evaluating our performance. In addition to today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules, we will be posting the transcript of today\u2019s call as well as an Excel version of key financial schedules. I will now review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary, before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now, let\u2019s move to second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 3% versus the second quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8% as currency had a negative impact of 5 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 3.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 13.9%, with currency negatively impacting our reported o-U.S. results by 10.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.1% worldwide, 2.4% in the U.S. and 14.2% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share, was $1.80 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.35 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 4.3% and 4.4% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 10.9%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. As stated last quarter, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary. Beginning with Consumer Health, worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 1.3%, with a decline of 3.6% in the U.S. and growth of 0.6% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 2.3% as currency had a negative impact of 3.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 2.9%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases; growth in OTC outside the U.S. due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and digestive health category recovery. This growth was partially offset by a weaker allergy season and supply constraints in the U.S., although these have improved from prior quarters. Furthermore, the Consumer Health business was negatively impacted by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions, mainly affecting the Skin Health/Beauty franchise. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.3 billion increased 6.7%, with growth of 4.2% in the U.S. and 9.8% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 12.3% as currency had a negative impact of 5.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 12.4%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.6%. Results in the quarter were impacted by unfavorable prior period adjustments offset by favorable discounts. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, STELARA, ERLEADA and TREMFYA, along with our paliperidone long-acting portfolio, which was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with the decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong operational sales growth with increases of 46.1% and 56.9% respectively. STELARA growth of 18.6% was driven by strong market growth and meaningful share gains in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. This represents 5.4 points and 7.4 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S. Results in the quarter benefited from favorable discounts partially offset by unfavorable prior period adjustments for a net favorable impact of approximately 400 basis points. TREMFYA grew 29.7%, driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This represents 2.3 points and 3.2 points of share gain respectively in the U.S. Results in the quarter were impacted by an unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 750 basis points in unfavorable patient mix. IMBRUVICA operational sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competition particularly in the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive operational growth outside of the U.S. despite ongoing competitive pressures. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.9 billion decreased 1.1%, with growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and declines of 3.6% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 3.4% as currency had a negative impact of 4.5 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 3.4%. Operational sales also grew sequentially versus the prior quarter despite headwinds related to regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions as well as labor and supply constraints. Drivers for growth across the MedTech business include procedure recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share positions in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms, each generating over $1 billion in annual sales. For additional context, all franchises were affected by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions and selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2022. I\u2019d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased supply network-related cost with the COVID-19 vaccine and inflation, partially offset by favorable mix. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.7 billion invested was a 9.1% increase versus the prior year primarily due to portfolio progression in pharmaceutical and MedTech. The other income and expense line was an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a net income of $488 million in the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by litigation, higher unrealized losses on securities and consumer health separation costs in the current year, partially offset by favorable employee benefit plan-related items. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.6% versus 5.8% in the same period last year. This was primarily driven by a 2021 one-time tax benefit from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.4% versus 14.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let\u2019s look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 33.4% to 34%, primarily driven by favorable product and segment mix, partially offset by inflation and portfolio progression in R&D. Pharmaceutical margin improved from 39.4% to 42%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and brand marketing expense leverage. MedTech margins declined from 28.6% to 26.5%, driven by inflation, unfavorable product mix and increased investments to support new product launches and research and development. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 28.6% to 25.9% due to commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies and one-time favorable items in 2021. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jess. As Joaquin and Jess commented, our results remained solid across our three segments in the second quarter and through the first half of 2022, particularly in light of macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation, select countries experiencing continuing impact from COVID-19 and geopolitical matters. Our sustainable, resilient business continues to deliver on the robust operational guidance that we set forth at the beginning of the year, while advancing breakthrough innovation and fostering patient access to make a positive impact across many areas of healthcare. As previously discussed, we did build in a healthy assumption to account for inflation in our January guidance, planning for increased costs in labor, energy and transportation. We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. As for segment performance and key events in the quarter, in MedTech, you may recall that performance in Q2 2021 was the strongest of the year for most of the MedTech peer set, including Johnson & Johnson, making this second quarter our toughest comp. On a sequential operational basis and in line with our expectations, we did see an acceleration in sales, even considering the regional COVID-19-related mobility restrictions this quarter. As Joaquin noted, we are focused on continuing the strong cadence of innovation in this business, which includes launches such as the next-generation ECHELON 3000 Stapler, a digitally enabled device demonstrating improved patient outcomes based on clinical evidence. It also includes the EMBOGUARD balloon guide catheter, designed to optimize the removal of blood clots and reduce procedure time in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In Pharmaceuticals, we continued to advance our pipeline and delivered operational sales growth of 8.6%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter, notably above what we delivered in the first quarter of this year. We continue to outpace the market. During the second quarter, we recorded our first sales in the U.S. of CARVYKTI, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with Legend Biotech and received European Commission approval in May. We also presented new data across our broad oncology portfolio at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association in June. If you haven\u2019t done so already, I encourage you to listen to the fireside chat with Peter Lee Woods, a global R&D Head of Oncology, about this promising new data, which can be found on our website. A quick update on our COVID-19 vaccine for which we suspended sales guidance last quarter, recognizing the global progress on vaccine development and distribution against COVID-19 and the amount of existing global supply, we are modifying our COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all customer contractual commitments. This will result in incremental costs for the year, which will be reflected as a special item. We are proud of the role our vaccine continues to play in the fight against COVID-19. In our Consumer Health business, similar to MedTech, Q2 of 2021 was last year\u2019s strongest quarter with 10% adjusted operational sales growth. We remain focused on our 2022 performance objectives of delivering above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while overcoming industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures that are primarily impacting our Skin Health business. We continue to be excited about the creation of the new consumer health company. Great work is being done by our teams to effect this complex transaction. We look forward to sharing the new Consumer Health company\u2019s name and branding as well as the headquarter\u2019s location in the months ahead. Similarly, we look forward to sharing transaction options and further financial details, adhering to regulatory policies later in 2022. Finally, I would like to offer my congratulations to Thibaut, Paul and the rest of the leadership team regarding their recent appointments. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of approximately $8 billion in the first half of the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $32.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately $32.6 billion of debt for a net neutral cash position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Investing in innovation that delivers meaningful products to address unmet needs continues to be our top priority. In the first half of the year, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first half of 2021. The dividend priority Joaquin referenced translated to us distributing $6 billion to shareholders so far this year. We also continue to vigorously evaluate acquisition opportunities that would enhance the current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations, the major takeaway is we are maintaining the midpoints of our guidance for adjusted operational sales growth of 7% at $97.8 billion and adjusted operational earnings per share of $10.70 or 9.2% growth for the full year. Given our confidence in delivering full year guidance, based on what we know today, we are tightening the adjusted earnings per share range from $10.65 to $10.75 on a constant currency basis. Regarding the remainder of the P&L, there are a few updates. Due to the prolonged impact of inflationary pressures, we are updating our operating margins to be flat versus 2021. Regarding interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we have reduced the expense to a neutral position. Again, given year-to-date trends, we are increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to reflect the favorable impact of employee benefit-related items. That may appear light given the current run rate, but we have some one-time items such as real estate sales and Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. gains, which we don\u2019t expect to repeat in the second half of this year. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% based on our year-to-date progression. As we always do, let me give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, specifically the strengthening U.S. dollar. Utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.0, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in April\u2019s guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $4 billion on reported sales and $0.65 on reported adjusted earnings per share. As this chart illustrates, it\u2019s not just that the euro and U.S. dollar have reached parity, something we haven\u2019t seen in nearly 2 decades. It\u2019s also the rapid pace at which the fluctuations are occurring, a dynamic only experienced a few times over that same period. In addition, while it\u2019s much too early to comment on 2023, we do think it is helpful to point out what the currency impact maybe if current assumptions for our estimate holds. Of the current $0.65 unfavorable impact I just referenced, about $0.30 to $0.35 will carry over into 2023\u2019s EPS. Certainly, there is a long way to go before we finalize next year\u2019s outlook, but wanted to give you a sense of how to think about the foreign currency impact. Back to the current year. In terms of 2022 quarterly phasing considerations for your models, we continue to estimate that the back half will improve over the first half with a slight bias for higher growth in Q4 over Q3. In Consumer Health, we have seen quarter-over-quarter reduction in supply disruptions that we anticipate will continue. We also expect to see the benefit of recent strategic price increases in the back half of the year. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2021 had lower growth than the third quarter, resulting in an easier comparison. For MedTech, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, driven by market recovery from continued enhancement of our competitive position through commercial execution and uptake from our recently launched products. We expect the fourth quarter 2022 to be slightly stronger than the third quarter. COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, and we continue to monitor any related impacts. For Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in our base business, with sales modestly accelerating through the end of the year. To close out the prepared remarks, Johnson & Johnson has continued to post solid results as our teams navigate a challenging external environment. Our financial performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow and deliver near and long-term value. That is only possible because of our employees around the world, who we\u2019d like to thank for remaining focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions and results for all of our credo stakeholders. Joaquin, Jess and I will now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those participants on the call wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part on the myeloma franchise obviously, another very strong quarter for DARZALEX, just wondering where conversion of subcu stands in the U.S. and Europe? And then the second part relates to, if you can share any metrics on the early CARVYKTI launch. Joe, I know you called that out, but just any insight there and then progress on increasing the supply of that product? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. So, thank you for the question. And let me start giving you a perspective on our myeloma franchise, which is one of the areas of strength for our Pharmaceutical business. On one hand, we continue to have a great progression with DARZALEX with 47% growth in this quarter. And Jess will update you on the exact numbers of the conversion from subcu to \u2013 from IV to subcu. What are the exact numbers?\nJessica Moore: Yes. In the U.S., we\u2019re about 85%. In Europe, we\u2019re around 80%.\nJoaquin Duato: Okay. So it continues to move in the right direction, given the enhanced convenience and ease of use for the patient that our subcu formulation offers. So DARZALEX is doing very well, and we feel very confident about the continuous progression of DARZALEX. On the other hand, we are also proud of the commercial launch of CARVYKTI in the U.S. following FDA approval and also the recent approval of CARVYKTI in EMEA. And together with that, to complement the strength of our myeloma franchise, we have received recently two breakthrough designations on our CD3 redirectors, one for teclistamab and another one for talquetamab. So we are proud to have a very comprehensive myeloma franchise that, due to its breadth, will enable us to award to try to convert myeloma into \u2013 from an uncurable disease to a chronic disease and potentially when they occur by sequencing and combining this treatment. So great idea of strength for the Pharmaceutical business of Johnson & Johnson, and it\u2019s an area that connects on how we are executing in our pipeline and progressing and what we discussed in our November R&D Day, where we portray our Pharmaceutical pipeline as one of the important drivers of us being able to achieve a $60 billion number in 2025. So it\u2019s a good sign of how we are progressing in our pipeline and in our existing portfolio with DARZALEX.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just I\u2019ll ask a high-level macro question. So Joaquin and Joe, at a high level, what are your assumptions for the macro headwinds in the second half? Joe, what\u2019s getting better? What\u2019s not? I\u2019m sure people would love to hear about input costs and inflation; COVID trends around the world, especially China; and lastly, hospital labor shortages. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nJoe Wolk: Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry and again, another nice job with the currency reporting. The macro headwinds, I would say, I would classify it as kind of two categories. The first is really around supply constraints, some of what we commented to at the end of last year that kind of persisted into the first part of this year. I would say that was primarily in our Consumer franchise, where product supply and availability inputs, if you will, were somewhat constrained. We are seeing, I would say, an alleviation of some of those constraints, and that\u2019s why we anticipate, specifically in our Skin Health and Beauty business to be much stronger in the second half. We know that point-of-sale demand continues to be strong for products like Aveeno and NEUTROGENA and we just didn\u2019t have enough on the shelf in the first half. We do anticipate that we will have more availability on the shelf in the second half of this year. And then there is the input cost themselves. As you probably noticed, we did have higher cost of goods in the quarter relative to last year of about 50 basis points. That\u2019s really across the board. So some of the raw materials that go into our product, they are certainly at a higher cost due to limited availability. There is some higher wage pressures, as you\u2019ve noted. I would say that\u2019s less within the world of Johnson & Johnson and our manufacturing entities and more around the third-party manufacturers that we contract with. But I would say those have stabilized. We did have a healthy assumption around inflation coming into the year. We think that has increased as we\u2019ve progressed through these first 6 months by about 40%. So, some of that will play into next year\u2019s thinking as well. As you know, the accounting is such where what we\u2019re building today, some of that gets relieved to the P&L early next year. But we think we\u2019re able to manage it, as you saw in our results, able to slightly beat. And we\u2019re being much more selective in terms of our resource deployment. We\u2019ve raised the bar on our selectivity of where we invest, but we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we were able to increase what we believe our future depends upon, and that\u2019s innovation by a 9% increase in R&D.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Can I just get latest thoughts on business development for both Pharma and MedTech? I guess specifically, you\u2019re seeing additional opportunities in the Pharma business with biotech valuations now having been depressed for, I guess, three or four quarters. And then on the MedTech business, I know this is a priority, Joaquin. Can you just talk about the landscape you\u2019re seeing as the company continues to engage on potential opportunities there? And then just a final one, just maybe following up on the last comment, for operating margins, I know they are flat this year due to inflation. Can we think about the company resuming operating margin expansion in 2023 or does some of these inflationary pressures you\u2019re seeing still need to annualize, and it\u2019s not as clear of what the directional trend for \u201823 will be at this point? Thanks so much.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Chris. And let me start with the M&A question first, and then Joe will address the operating margin question. So M&A has always been an important component of Johnson & Johnson innovation, as I was talking in the past 5 years, we executed about 40 acquisitions, some major licensing agreements, investing over $16 billion. And specifically in our Pharmaceutical business, about half of our innovation, it\u2019s coming sourced externally. So when we look at M&A, we took \u2013 we take a strategic approach. The first thing we try to look at is what is the improvement in the standard of care that we are looking in that particular opportunity and to what extent it enables us to get into higher growth markets. And we are agnostic about which sector. So we try to look at those opportunities in the context of the improvement in standard of care, entering to higher-growth markets and delivering a fair financial return. So as we look at the opportunities today in the market, we are not opportunistic about it, and we are still looking always at the fundamentals of these companies. And obviously, there are different opportunities in the market that are interesting and can complement our existing franchises or built into adjacencies. When it comes to MedTech, the focus continues to be strengthening our current strongholds and also accessing some high-growth market segments to accelerate growth. And the target areas are the ones that we are operating today: high health orthopedics, cardiology, surgery, Historically, it\u2019s been a predictor of our success to the extent we were closer to the areas that we have capabilities. When it comes to pharmaceuticals, we are looking at our key therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pulmonary hypertension and also cardiovascular and metabolics. So we are agnostic, as you know, at the source of innovation, and we use multiple modalities to onboard innovation from acquisitions to equity investments to strategic collaborations. So down the road, we continue to see M&A as an important source of building our pipeline and also fortifying our current portfolio and we are now in a position that, for the first time, right, Joe, in the last 5 years, we\u2019re in a cash-neutral position. And we continue to look at the opportunities that are out there, and we will continue to do it.\nJoe Wolk: Yes, well said. Chris thanks for the question regarding operating margins. I don\u2019t want to get too far out in front of my SKUs with respect to projecting next year at this point, but maybe some considerations that you should have in mind. We always look to streamline our business, where possible, look for inefficiencies and either let that fall to the bottom line or preferably put that into R&D. So as we close out the second half of the year, I\u2019d like to see how our pipeline is progressing. If some of that\u2019s accelerated, that\u2019s going to be reason for additional investment. I do think these inflationary pressures will be here to stay. I don\u2019t see a lot of decreases on the near-term horizon. I\u2019d also ask you not to lose sight of the fact that we are separating out our Consumer Health business, and we are taking that opportunity to look at, I would say, how we support our business, the infrastructure that\u2019s involved with a two-segment company versus the historical three-segment company we have. I\u2019d like to see a little bit more of the separation time line play out before we commit to any of those efficiencies that may be gained there and exactly when the timing of those may be incurred, whether that\u2019s the first half or second half of 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two parts. The first part, I want to just spend some time on hospital volumes, what you are seeing in terms of elective surgeries throughout the summer and then into the back half of the year. And then I will toss the second question on now to you. You talked about targeted price increases. How do you think about \u201cthe target\u201d and how well are they being accepted? And I am thinking not just in \u2013 across the board, but almost specifically in MedTech. Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Joe, do you want to start with the targeted price increases and I go then to the volumes.\nJoe Wolk: Sure. Yes. So, the targeted price increases we referred to, Joanne, and thanks for the question. In consumer, that\u2019s kind of keeping consistent with the peer set to offset the inflationary pressures. We do know that while folks are looking to more generally cut back spending that\u2019s been in entertainment, dining out, when it comes healthcare, better health, looking better, products like AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, Tylenol, Listerine, they seem to do really well, and consumers will prioritize those. With specifically to MedTech, as you probably appreciate, a lot of our portfolio is really governed by contracts that are already in place with hospital systems. So, it\u2019s difficult unless there is certain inflationary clauses within those contracts. That\u2019s what we mean when we say targeted. It\u2019s very selective and I would say it\u2019s probably not the majority of the hospital volumes or hospital contracting that you may say. Joaquin, you want to talk about volumes?\nJoaquin Duato: When it comes to hospital volumes and the trajectory of MedTech in general, right. Overall, our MedTech business delivered 6% competitive growth in the first half of 2022 and delivered just over 1% sequential operational growth Q2 versus Q1. So, that is in the middle of the market headwinds due to mobility restrictions inflation and supply challenges. So, a very resilient performance of our J&J MedTech business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and competitive, and we continue to see market share positive trajectory in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms in which we are maintaining or gaining share in the most recent period of Q1 2022. And we see also good progression in our pipeline and new products launched. Overall, for the market, when we are talking about the market specifically, we saw improvements in procedure volume in North America, in EMEA and in Lat-Am. That remain above pre-COVID levels through the quarter. So, that was the positive side. On the other hand, we saw the impact of regional mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. Moving forward, we estimate that we will have a continuous improvement in the second half of the year due to continued market recovery and also our own competitive momentum while, at the same time, we are going to continue to monitor the COVID-19 dynamics and the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, I wanted to ask you about milvexian and Factor XIa inhibitors and what you see the market opportunity to be. Also, what data will you be presenting at ESC this year? And then can you give any color on indications you will be pursuing in your Phase 3 studies? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you for the question. And milvexian, it\u2019s an important component of our pipeline. As a matter of fact, when we met with you in November, milvexian was one of the five medicines that we estimated we are going to continue peak sales of about $5 billion. That was together with CARVYKTI, milvexian, nipocalimab, amivantamab plus lazertinib and our Auris platform. So, those were the five medicines that we are going to contributing \u2013 to contribute more than $5 billion. And clearly, milvexian, it\u2019s an important one in that context. We are developing milvexian, as you know, in collaboration with BMS, and we see this as an important opportunity to improve the standard of care in the current indications for oral anticoagulants, which are very large. And they are easily to be estimated because you know where they are used today, but also the potential to expand into areas in which today, oral anticoagulants are not used to bleeding concerns. So, we see a very significant market opportunity for milvexian as an improvement of this category versus the Factor Xa. So, there are two Phase 2 studies that are assessing the potential of milvexian to reduce their risk of cardiovascular events. One is the one of total knee replacement. Data on that one was presented earlier in 2021. And the second one, which I guess is the one you are referring to, is the one in secondary stroke prevention, which we want to determine whether the addition of milvexian through aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than standard anti-plated [ph] therapy in secondary stroke prevention. The data, as you know, is already in-house, and we expect to present it in a medical meeting in 2022. Specifically, I think it\u2019s at the end of August in a European cardiology meeting. And at that point, we shall see. But for us, if the data pans out, obviously, milvexian could have a very significant market opportunity that goes beyond the existing Factor Xa plus.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had just two on the medical devices franchise. And the first is, it\u2019s just on the volume recovery. I think as we listen to hospital executives and insurers talk about the volume recovery, we consistently hear about this not getting back to pre-pandemic levels even as we sit in the first half of 2022. I just wanted to, kind of sanity check and, Joe, see, and Joaquin, if there is any kind of metrics you can give us in terms of where J&J\u2019s volumes sit relative to 2019? While it\u2019s not the most appropriate comp here as we are a couple of years out from 2019, but wanted to just get your views on where the disconnect is in terms of the revenue growth that we are seeing from your businesses off of 2019 versus volume growth. And why we are hearing some of this the commentary that we are not back to pre-pandemic volumes yet? And then the second question, I guess is for Joaquin and just thinking about your strategy and to accelerate momentum in the MedTech business had a nice start to 2022. But wanted to kind of get a better understanding of, I guess the plan and the roadmap in terms of the number of quarters, years that you envision assessing success and hitting your internal targets? Is this a 2-year to 3-year plan, or could you see acute strategic, new strategies implemented if you are not seeing the momentum that you expect to see over the next 6 months, 12 months, 18 months? Thanks for taking both questions.\nJoe Wolk: Hi Josh, this is Joe. Let me try to answer the first part of that question, and then I will turn it over to Joaquin for the second part, the first part being around volume recovery. To your point, and it\u2019s something that we struggle with internally, it\u2019s really still clunky when it comes to comparative analysis versus prior periods. So, we do look back at 2019, I can tell you our operational sales growth for MedTech over the first six months is about 10% overall. I would say half of that is \u2013 maybe two-thirds is really attributable to just a great job that Ashley and her team have been doing with launching new products and better execution. So, our cadence of innovation has improved. We have got a lot of new offerings across really all four of those major franchises and we are picking up market share because of that. And then I would say probably the rest is procedure volume. Again, it gets really difficult to really draw comparisons around procedure volume because we still are dealing with the impact of COVID in the second quarter alone in China. That impacted growth and procedures were down roughly 25% with a little bit improvement towards the last month from what we saw in April and May. So, we continue to look at that as well. But I would say the improvement in MedTech is really come from the stated goals that you heard a couple of years ago from Ashley and team, and that\u2019s a better cadence of innovation. I think we are going to \u2013 we had 10 new products launched in the first half of this year. Roughly the same amount is relied upon in the second half and then again, attracting market share with better effectiveness through our sales force and commercial efforts.\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. Thank you, Josh, and thank you for the question on MedTech because it gives me an opportunity to talk more about the performance of the MedTech business. And a couple of aspects there. One is the current performance and then how we are improving our market share and commercial execution and also our new product introduction and our pipeline progression. So, in the first half of the year, I just commented that our group has a competitive growth of 6%. It\u2019s also underlying by our growth in the first quarter of 8.6%. We will see how the rest of the sector performs in this quarter, but our growth in the first half of the year was a competitive growth with 6%. So, in that sense, my view is that we are already getting competitive growth rates in MedTech with 6% in the first half of the year. The growth rate in the second quarter has to be also put into perspective in the fact that the comparison with the second quarter of 2021 is a difficult one. MedTech grew 59% in the second quarter of 2021. And also there was some impact of the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. So, we are improving our commercial execution and improving our pipeline. In the commercial execution, the data that we have from the first quarter shows that we are maintaining or gaining share in 10 of our 11 largest platforms. So, that\u2019s a good indication that the recovery is in play. And on the new product pipeline, there is many exciting new developments that we are getting to market, starting with the fact that our MONARCH robotic platform has received 510 clearance for urology indications, which are going to open a new market for us in kidney stones. We have now enrolled the first patient in our electrophysiology pulse field ablation study, which is going to give us another innovation in our very successful electrophysiology business. We just launched our new Stapler ECHELON 3000, which is a digitally enabled device that comes also with significant evidence on how it improves patient outcomes in the cerebrovascular franchise. We just launched EMBOGUARD Balloon Catheter, which is designed to optimize the removal of blood clots in ischemic stroke and reducing time. So, there is a number of positive developments that are enhancing our ability to launch new products there. So, we feel optimistic about the combination of executing on our commercial priorities and at the same time, continue the good cadence of new product innovation that, that is going to take us to competitive growth as demonstrated by our 6% growth in the first half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Shibutani: Good morning and thank you. A two-part question on the U.S. immunology market in general, and TREMFYA specifically. Across the category, what\u2019s your view on the outlook for how the balance of the year will progress in the immunology category based upon what you are seeing in terms of patient volume trends year-to-date? And then specifically on TREMFYA, the performance and outlook there, you highlighted some share gains in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Where are these gains coming from? Can you help us understand competitive dynamics versus other biologics? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. Great question, Chris. Overall, we see a recovery in the immunology market with new patient levels already exceeding pre-COVID levels. So, we are optimistic about the recovery, specifically utilizing the metric of new patients. So, that\u2019s progressing well for the immunology market. When it comes to TREMFYA, it continues to deliver strong growth worldwide, with net trade sales growing in the quarter about 30%, despite of headwind of a prior period adjustment that has reduced about 750 basis points. So, a strong performance of TREMFYA. When it comes to share, I think it was commented that we capture about 2.5 points incremental in psoriasis and about a larger amount in psoriatic arthritis, where we are already the market share leader. It was three points in psoriatic arthritis. It\u2019s difficult to tell you where this is coming from. I mean we are assuming that this is going to be coming from older therapies that are there in the market, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. But clearly, TREMFYA is doing really well, both in psoriasis and in psoriatic arthritis. And psoriatic arthritis is the market-leading in new-to-brand share. We are also pleased with the fact that we have published recently first and best-in-class 5-year durability data, and also that we have been able to be the only IL-23 therapy to demonstrate inhibition of structural damage in PSA. So, we are very positive about the trajectory of TREMFYA, which is a reflection of the strength of our immunology franchise. Continuing with the future of TREMFYA, which I think it\u2019s important for you to consider, we are now fully enrolled in our trial in ulcerative colitis, and we are nearing fully enrollment completion in our trial in Crohn\u2019s disease. So, that predicates well for the growth of TREMFYA moving forward. Addition to that \u2013 in addition to that, we presented very encouraging and interesting data in IBD in combination of TREMFYA with SIMPONI, so guselkumab that show best-in-class results and best-in-class data, and we are very pleased with that. And also, if you look at our pipeline, we are also continuing to progress into Phase 2 with our own oral IL-23. So, very strong future of TREMFYA, one of the key products in our growth moving forward, a very strong future for our franchise in immunology.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Chris. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Your line is now live.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So, congrats on the results and the updates. My question is about proposed drug pricing legislation, which is concerning given its potential impact on innovation and the State of New Jersey where you are headquartered. So, could you please comment on how the legislation would negatively impact incentives to pursue transformational new medicines for seniors and what J&J is doing to educate senators in New Jersey and beyond? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you for the question and a great question. First, it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on the content of the legislation or the feasibility of that legislation passing. There has been a lot of ups and downs there. While we are very closely following the dynamics, the situation is still fluid. So, it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on the actual legislation or in the feasibility. Now, if we believe that the legislation is going to base on the language that we know from the Senate Finance Committee, as you pointed out, that will have a significant detrimental effect on the ability of the industry, of the companies to be able to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Just for perspective, the biopharmaceutical industry invested about $120 billion in R&D in 2020. Johnson & Johnson, ourselves, in our pharmaceutical business, we invested $12 billion in R&D in 2021. So, as a company that invests heavily in R&D, we can tell you that the type of legislation that was proposed by the Senate Finance Committee with Medicare price setting will have a chilling effect in innovation that will be translated in less new medicines for patients. Again, for perspective, since 2000, the pharmaceutical industry has introduced about 1,000 new medicines. The impact that this will have may affect the advances that we have in multiple areas that are still needed to be able to advance patient care. So, it\u2019s a very seamless situation that will affect innovation, will affect our ability to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Now, we are also engaging with different stakeholders in trying to educate them about the impact of this type of legislation and innovation. But at the same time, we also want to sit at the table and participate in discussions to address what we believe is the major issue, which is patient affordability and patient access, specifically in Part D. So, we think that, that\u2019s something that the industry has to address with the relevant stakeholders, and we are very willing to sit at the table and shoulder the consequences of being able to address the patient affordability issue. Now, I always have \u2013 I always need to remember to you that in a price-constrained environment, Johnson & Johnson performs relatively better than most of our peers and competitors based on a number of factors. First, our diversification. Second, we have about half of our sales that come outside of the U.S. And third, specifically in the pharmaceutical business, we have been able to deliver above-market growth in the face of mid-single digit niche price decreases. So, we know how to grow in a difficult pricing environment. As a matter of fact, all of our growth comes from volume. So, if you are thinking about where to be in these circumstances, Johnson & Johnson really, it\u2019s a good place based on its diversification and our ability to drive growth through volume.\nJessica Moore: Wonderful. Thank you, David, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, everybody, for participating in the call. Again, very pleased with the solid results achieved by our teams year-to-date. It shows the quality and the market leadership of our franchises and the great execution of our company in the middle of these challenges. We are also making good progress in the three strategic priorities that I outlined at the outset of this call regarding the consumer separation and the creation of the new Johnson & Johnson, our ability to continue to grow in our pharmaceutical business through the STELARA patent expiration and our continued recovery and competitive growth and MedTech. As we conclude today, also a quick reminder on our recent ESG investor update, which highlighted progress against our 2025 Health for Humanity goals. I encourage all of you to listen to the webcast replay on our website if you didn\u2019t have a chance to do it already. We look forward to connecting with all of you again and keeping you updated on our continuous progress on future earnings calls. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our webcast and teleconference today. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jess. As Joaquin and Jess commented, our results remained solid across our three segments in the second quarter and through the first half of 2022, particularly in light of macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation, select countries experiencing continuing impact from COVID-19 and geopolitical matters. Our sustainable, resilient business continues to deliver on the robust operational guidance that we set forth at the beginning of the year, while advancing breakthrough innovation and fostering patient access to make a positive impact across many areas of healthcare. As previously discussed, we did build in a healthy assumption to account for inflation in our January guidance, planning for increased costs in labor, energy and transportation. We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. As for segment performance and key events in the quarter, in MedTech, you may recall that performance in Q2 2021 was the strongest of the year for most of the MedTech peer set, including Johnson & Johnson, making this second quarter our toughest comp. On a sequential operational basis and in line with our expectations, we did see an acceleration in sales, even considering the regional COVID-19-related mobility restrictions this quarter. As Joaquin noted, we are focused on continuing the strong cadence of innovation in this business, which includes launches such as the next-generation ECHELON 3000 Stapler, a digitally enabled device demonstrating improved patient outcomes based on clinical evidence. It also includes the EMBOGUARD balloon guide catheter, designed to optimize the removal of blood clots and reduce procedure time in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In Pharmaceuticals, we continued to advance our pipeline and delivered operational sales growth of 8.6%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter, notably above what we delivered in the first quarter of this year. We continue to outpace the market. During the second quarter, we recorded our first sales in the U.S. of CARVYKTI, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with Legend Biotech and received European Commission approval in May. We also presented new data across our broad oncology portfolio at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association in June. If you haven't done so already, I encourage you to listen to the fireside chat with Peter Lee Woods, a global R&D Head of Oncology, about this promising new data, which can be found on our website. A quick update on our COVID-19 vaccine for which we suspended sales guidance last quarter, recognizing the global progress on vaccine development and distribution against COVID-19 and the amount of existing global supply, we are modifying our COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all customer contractual commitments. This will result in incremental costs for the year, which will be reflected as a special item. We are proud of the role our vaccine continues to play in the fight against COVID-19. In our Consumer Health business, similar to MedTech, Q2 of 2021 was last year's strongest quarter with 10% adjusted operational sales growth. We remain focused on our 2022 performance objectives of delivering above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while overcoming industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures that are primarily impacting our Skin Health business. We continue to be excited about the creation of the new consumer health company. Great work is being done by our teams to effect this complex transaction. We look forward to sharing the new Consumer Health company's name and branding as well as the headquarter's location in the months ahead. Similarly, we look forward to sharing transaction options and further financial details, adhering to regulatory policies later in 2022. Finally, I would like to offer my congratulations to Thibaut, Paul and the rest of the leadership team regarding their recent appointments. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of approximately $8 billion in the first half of the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $32.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately $32.6 billion of debt for a net neutral cash position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Investing in innovation that delivers meaningful products to address unmet needs continues to be our top priority. In the first half of the year, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first half of 2021. The dividend priority Joaquin referenced translated to us distributing $6 billion to shareholders so far this year. We also continue to vigorously evaluate acquisition opportunities that would enhance the current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations, the major takeaway is we are maintaining the midpoints of our guidance for adjusted operational sales growth of 7% at $97.8 billion and adjusted operational earnings per share of $10.70 or 9.2% growth for the full year. Given our confidence in delivering full year guidance, based on what we know today, we are tightening the adjusted earnings per share range from $10.65 to $10.75 on a constant currency basis. Regarding the remainder of the P&L, there are a few updates. Due to the prolonged impact of inflationary pressures, we are updating our operating margins to be flat versus 2021. Regarding interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we have reduced the expense to a neutral position. Again, given year-to-date trends, we are increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to reflect the favorable impact of employee benefit-related items. That may appear light given the current run rate, but we have some one-time items such as real estate sales and Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. gains, which we don't expect to repeat in the second half of this year. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% based on our year-to-date progression. As we always do, let me give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, specifically the strengthening U.S. dollar. Utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.0, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in April's guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $4 billion on reported sales and $0.65 on reported adjusted earnings per share. As this chart illustrates, it's not just that the euro and U.S. dollar have reached parity, something we haven't seen in nearly 2 decades. It's also the rapid pace at which the fluctuations are occurring, a dynamic only experienced a few times over that same period. In addition, while it's much too early to comment on 2023, we do think it is helpful to point out what the currency impact maybe if current assumptions for our estimate holds. Of the current $0.65 unfavorable impact I just referenced, about $0.30 to $0.35 will carry over into 2023's EPS. Certainly, there is a long way to go before we finalize next year's outlook, but wanted to give you a sense of how to think about the foreign currency impact. Back to the current year. In terms of 2022 quarterly phasing considerations for your models, we continue to estimate that the back half will improve over the first half with a slight bias for higher growth in Q4 over Q3. In Consumer Health, we have seen quarter-over-quarter reduction in supply disruptions that we anticipate will continue. We also expect to see the benefit of recent strategic price increases in the back half of the year. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2021 had lower growth than the third quarter, resulting in an easier comparison. For MedTech, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, driven by market recovery from continued enhancement of our competitive position through commercial execution and uptake from our recently launched products. We expect the fourth quarter 2022 to be slightly stronger than the third quarter. COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, and we continue to monitor any related impacts. For Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in our base business, with sales modestly accelerating through the end of the year. To close out the prepared remarks, Johnson & Johnson has continued to post solid results as our teams navigate a challenging external environment. Our financial performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow and deliver near and long-term value. That is only possible because of our employees around the world, who we'd like to thank for remaining focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions and results for all of our credo stakeholders. Joaquin, Jess and I will now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those participants on the call wishing to ask a question? Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry and again, another nice job with the currency reporting. The macro headwinds, I would say, I would classify it as kind of two categories. The first is really around supply constraints, some of what we commented to at the end of last year that kind of persisted into the first part of this year. I would say that was primarily in our Consumer franchise, where product supply and availability inputs, if you will, were somewhat constrained. We are seeing, I would say, an alleviation of some of those constraints, and that's why we anticipate, specifically in our Skin Health and Beauty business to be much stronger in the second half. We know that point-of-sale demand continues to be strong for products like Aveeno and NEUTROGENA and we just didn't have enough on the shelf in the first half. We do anticipate that we will have more availability on the shelf in the second half of this year. And then there is the input cost themselves. As you probably noticed, we did have higher cost of goods in the quarter relative to last year of about 50 basis points. That's really across the board. So some of the raw materials that go into our product, they are certainly at a higher cost due to limited availability. There is some higher wage pressures, as you've noted. I would say that's less within the world of Johnson & Johnson and our manufacturing entities and more around the third-party manufacturers that we contract with. But I would say those have stabilized. We did have a healthy assumption around inflation coming into the year. We think that has increased as we've progressed through these first 6 months by about 40%. So, some of that will play into next year's thinking as well. As you know, the accounting is such where what we're building today, some of that gets relieved to the P&L early next year. But we think we're able to manage it, as you saw in our results, able to slightly beat. And we're being much more selective in terms of our resource deployment. We've raised the bar on our selectivity of where we invest, but we're very proud of the fact that we were able to increase what we believe our future depends upon, and that's innovation by a 9% increase in R&D. Yes, well said. Chris thanks for the question regarding operating margins. I don't want to get too far out in front of my SKUs with respect to projecting next year at this point, but maybe some considerations that you should have in mind. We always look to streamline our business, where possible, look for inefficiencies and either let that fall to the bottom line or preferably put that into R&D. So as we close out the second half of the year, I'd like to see how our pipeline is progressing. If some of that's accelerated, that's going to be reason for additional investment. I do think these inflationary pressures will be here to stay. I don't see a lot of decreases on the near-term horizon. I'd also ask you not to lose sight of the fact that we are separating out our Consumer Health business, and we are taking that opportunity to look at, I would say, how we support our business, the infrastructure that's involved with a two-segment company versus the historical three-segment company we have. I'd like to see a little bit more of the separation time line play out before we commit to any of those efficiencies that may be gained there and exactly when the timing of those may be incurred, whether that's the first half or second half of 2023. Sure. Yes. So, the targeted price increases we referred to, Joanne, and thanks for the question. In consumer, that's kind of keeping consistent with the peer set to offset the inflationary pressures. We do know that while folks are looking to more generally cut back spending that's been in entertainment, dining out, when it comes healthcare, better health, looking better, products like AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, Tylenol, Listerine, they seem to do really well, and consumers will prioritize those. With specifically to MedTech, as you probably appreciate, a lot of our portfolio is really governed by contracts that are already in place with hospital systems. So, it's difficult unless there is certain inflationary clauses within those contracts. That's what we mean when we say targeted. It's very selective and I would say it's probably not the majority of the hospital volumes or hospital contracting that you may say. Joaquin, you want to talk about volumes? Hi Josh, this is Joe. Let me try to answer the first part of that question, and then I will turn it over to Joaquin for the second part, the first part being around volume recovery. To your point, and it's something that we struggle with internally, it's really still clunky when it comes to comparative analysis versus prior periods. So, we do look back at 2019, I can tell you our operational sales growth for MedTech over the first six months is about 10% overall. I would say half of that is \u2013 maybe two-thirds is really attributable to just a great job that Ashley and her team have been doing with launching new products and better execution. So, our cadence of innovation has improved. We have got a lot of new offerings across really all four of those major franchises and we are picking up market share because of that. And then I would say probably the rest is procedure volume. Again, it gets really difficult to really draw comparisons around procedure volume because we still are dealing with the impact of COVID in the second quarter alone in China. That impacted growth and procedures were down roughly 25% with a little bit improvement towards the last month from what we saw in April and May. So, we continue to look at that as well. But I would say the improvement in MedTech is really come from the stated goals that you heard a couple of years ago from Ashley and team, and that's a better cadence of innovation. I think we are going to \u2013 we had 10 new products launched in the first half of this year. Roughly the same amount is relied upon in the second half and then again, attracting market share with better effectiveness through our sales force and commercial efforts."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. This is Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thanks for joining us today. I am accompanied by Joe Wolk and Jessica Moore and we have the privilege to share our second quarter financial results and answer questions you have regarding Johnson & Johnson's business. During my first 6 months as CEO, I have had the opportunity to reconnect in person with colleagues, customers and stakeholders around the world. These conversations have energized me about the future of Johnson & Johnson. They have also made clear the critical role our company plays as a leader in bringing innovative healthcare solutions to patients and customers both today and long into the future. And they further validated that the three strategic priorities I outlined earlier this year will continue to guide us in 2022 as we deliver on our mission to transform the future of human health. Let me remind you of those priorities. First, we will continue to advance our industry leading success in pharmaceuticals by delivering the innovative pipeline we highlighted at our pharmaceutical business review last November. This includes our goal to grow this sector to $60 billion by 2025, with growth in every year, including years facing the STELARA loss of exclusivity and continuing to deliver above-market compounded annual growth of at least 5%. In the second quarter, we saw evidence of this plan coming to fruition with the launch of CARVYKTI in April. And in May, we received conditional marketing authorization in Europe. In addition, talquetamab was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in June. I have great confidence in the strength of our current portfolio, which remains underappreciated, and in our robust pipeline to meet our long-term goals and to deliver transformational medicines that help improve and save lives. Our second priority, continue to strengthen our performance in MedTech. Over the past several years, this acceleration in performance has been driven by the delivery of differentiated solutions as well as improved commercial execution. We expect this improvement to continue, enabled by our innovative pipeline as well as the potential for expansion into higher growth market segments. Currently, 11 MedTech platforms each delivered over $1 billion in revenue annually. And based on the most recent results, we are gaining or holding share in nearly all of these. With the positive momentum in this business and our improvement in competitiveness, MedTech has delivered 6% adjusted operational growth in the first half of 2022. We believe MedTech will continue to be a significant source of value for our investors and our stakeholders. Third, we are separating our Consumer Health business to create two market leading standalone companies. This separation can be a significant opportunity for value creation. The two new global entities will be well positioned to thrive in their respective markets and drive greater strategic and financial success. We are making excellent progress and remain on track to complete the separation in 2023. In the second quarter, we announced the global leadership team for the new Consumer Health organization led by Thibaut Mongon as CEO designate and Paul Ruh as CFO designate. Having worked with both Thibaut and Paul for many years, I am confident we have selected the right leadership team to lead the new Consumer Health company in its next chapter. The new Johnson & Johnson comprising our pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses will remain the largest, most diversified healthcare products company in the world, with over $80 billion in sales. With enhanced operational focus, the new Johnson & Johnson will be poised to bring integrated, comprehensive, disease-centric technology and innovative solutions to enhance patient care. Our balance sheet will remain strong, allowing us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities in higher growth markets across both segments, while maintaining our strong dividend distribution. With these clear priorities in place, we are confident in our ability to execute on both our short-term and long-term objectives. We are very pleased to have delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first half of 2022, reporting adjusted operational sales and EPS growth of 8% and 8.5% respectively. Joe and Jess will share details reflecting above-market adjusted operational sales growth from pharmaceuticals and continued resiliency in both MedTech and Consumer Health results that stand out given the current global macroeconomic challenges. We are well positioned across the globe to sustain our leadership position in healthcare. We aspire to accelerate growth, while maintaining the diversification in our business and our discipline around capital allocation, which have been foundational to our success for over the past 135 years. I look forward to addressing your questions soon. But for now, I will turn the call over to Jessica Moore to discuss those details. Jess? Thank you. So, thank you for the question. And let me start giving you a perspective on our myeloma franchise, which is one of the areas of strength for our Pharmaceutical business. On one hand, we continue to have a great progression with DARZALEX with 47% growth in this quarter. And Jess will update you on the exact numbers of the conversion from subcu to \u2013 from IV to subcu. What are the exact numbers? Okay. So it continues to move in the right direction, given the enhanced convenience and ease of use for the patient that our subcu formulation offers. So DARZALEX is doing very well, and we feel very confident about the continuous progression of DARZALEX. On the other hand, we are also proud of the commercial launch of CARVYKTI in the U.S. following FDA approval and also the recent approval of CARVYKTI in EMEA. And together with that, to complement the strength of our myeloma franchise, we have received recently two breakthrough designations on our CD3 redirectors, one for teclistamab and another one for talquetamab. So we are proud to have a very comprehensive myeloma franchise that, due to its breadth, will enable us to award to try to convert myeloma into \u2013 from an uncurable disease to a chronic disease and potentially when they occur by sequencing and combining this treatment. So great idea of strength for the Pharmaceutical business of Johnson & Johnson, and it's an area that connects on how we are executing in our pipeline and progressing and what we discussed in our November R&D Day, where we portray our Pharmaceutical pipeline as one of the important drivers of us being able to achieve a $60 billion number in 2025. So it's a good sign of how we are progressing in our pipeline and in our existing portfolio with DARZALEX. Thank you, Chris. And let me start with the M&A question first, and then Joe will address the operating margin question. So M&A has always been an important component of Johnson & Johnson innovation, as I was talking in the past 5 years, we executed about 40 acquisitions, some major licensing agreements, investing over $16 billion. And specifically in our Pharmaceutical business, about half of our innovation, it's coming sourced externally. So when we look at M&A, we took \u2013 we take a strategic approach. The first thing we try to look at is what is the improvement in the standard of care that we are looking in that particular opportunity and to what extent it enables us to get into higher growth markets. And we are agnostic about which sector. So we try to look at those opportunities in the context of the improvement in standard of care, entering to higher-growth markets and delivering a fair financial return. So as we look at the opportunities today in the market, we are not opportunistic about it, and we are still looking always at the fundamentals of these companies. And obviously, there are different opportunities in the market that are interesting and can complement our existing franchises or built into adjacencies. When it comes to MedTech, the focus continues to be strengthening our current strongholds and also accessing some high-growth market segments to accelerate growth. And the target areas are the ones that we are operating today: high health orthopedics, cardiology, surgery, Historically, it's been a predictor of our success to the extent we were closer to the areas that we have capabilities. When it comes to pharmaceuticals, we are looking at our key therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pulmonary hypertension and also cardiovascular and metabolics. So we are agnostic, as you know, at the source of innovation, and we use multiple modalities to onboard innovation from acquisitions to equity investments to strategic collaborations. So down the road, we continue to see M&A as an important source of building our pipeline and also fortifying our current portfolio and we are now in a position that, for the first time, right, Joe, in the last 5 years, we're in a cash-neutral position. And we continue to look at the opportunities that are out there, and we will continue to do it. Joe, do you want to start with the targeted price increases and I go then to the volumes. When it comes to hospital volumes and the trajectory of MedTech in general, right. Overall, our MedTech business delivered 6% competitive growth in the first half of 2022 and delivered just over 1% sequential operational growth Q2 versus Q1. So, that is in the middle of the market headwinds due to mobility restrictions inflation and supply challenges. So, a very resilient performance of our J&J MedTech business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and competitive, and we continue to see market share positive trajectory in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms in which we are maintaining or gaining share in the most recent period of Q1 2022. And we see also good progression in our pipeline and new products launched. Overall, for the market, when we are talking about the market specifically, we saw improvements in procedure volume in North America, in EMEA and in Lat-Am. That remain above pre-COVID levels through the quarter. So, that was the positive side. On the other hand, we saw the impact of regional mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. Moving forward, we estimate that we will have a continuous improvement in the second half of the year due to continued market recovery and also our own competitive momentum while, at the same time, we are going to continue to monitor the COVID-19 dynamics and the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. Thank you for the question. And milvexian, it's an important component of our pipeline. As a matter of fact, when we met with you in November, milvexian was one of the five medicines that we estimated we are going to continue peak sales of about $5 billion. That was together with CARVYKTI, milvexian, nipocalimab, amivantamab plus lazertinib and our Auris platform. So, those were the five medicines that we are going to contributing \u2013 to contribute more than $5 billion. And clearly, milvexian, it's an important one in that context. We are developing milvexian, as you know, in collaboration with BMS, and we see this as an important opportunity to improve the standard of care in the current indications for oral anticoagulants, which are very large. And they are easily to be estimated because you know where they are used today, but also the potential to expand into areas in which today, oral anticoagulants are not used to bleeding concerns. So, we see a very significant market opportunity for milvexian as an improvement of this category versus the Factor Xa. So, there are two Phase 2 studies that are assessing the potential of milvexian to reduce their risk of cardiovascular events. One is the one of total knee replacement. Data on that one was presented earlier in 2021. And the second one, which I guess is the one you are referring to, is the one in secondary stroke prevention, which we want to determine whether the addition of milvexian through aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than standard anti-plated [ph] therapy in secondary stroke prevention. The data, as you know, is already in-house, and we expect to present it in a medical meeting in 2022. Specifically, I think it's at the end of August in a European cardiology meeting. And at that point, we shall see. But for us, if the data pans out, obviously, milvexian could have a very significant market opportunity that goes beyond the existing Factor Xa plus. Yes. Thank you, Josh, and thank you for the question on MedTech because it gives me an opportunity to talk more about the performance of the MedTech business. And a couple of aspects there. One is the current performance and then how we are improving our market share and commercial execution and also our new product introduction and our pipeline progression. So, in the first half of the year, I just commented that our group has a competitive growth of 6%. It's also underlying by our growth in the first quarter of 8.6%. We will see how the rest of the sector performs in this quarter, but our growth in the first half of the year was a competitive growth with 6%. So, in that sense, my view is that we are already getting competitive growth rates in MedTech with 6% in the first half of the year. The growth rate in the second quarter has to be also put into perspective in the fact that the comparison with the second quarter of 2021 is a difficult one. MedTech grew 59% in the second quarter of 2021. And also there was some impact of the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. So, we are improving our commercial execution and improving our pipeline. In the commercial execution, the data that we have from the first quarter shows that we are maintaining or gaining share in 10 of our 11 largest platforms. So, that's a good indication that the recovery is in play. And on the new product pipeline, there is many exciting new developments that we are getting to market, starting with the fact that our MONARCH robotic platform has received 510 clearance for urology indications, which are going to open a new market for us in kidney stones. We have now enrolled the first patient in our electrophysiology pulse field ablation study, which is going to give us another innovation in our very successful electrophysiology business. We just launched our new Stapler ECHELON 3000, which is a digitally enabled device that comes also with significant evidence on how it improves patient outcomes in the cerebrovascular franchise. We just launched EMBOGUARD Balloon Catheter, which is designed to optimize the removal of blood clots in ischemic stroke and reducing time. So, there is a number of positive developments that are enhancing our ability to launch new products there. So, we feel optimistic about the combination of executing on our commercial priorities and at the same time, continue the good cadence of new product innovation that, that is going to take us to competitive growth as demonstrated by our 6% growth in the first half of the year. Thank you. Great question, Chris. Overall, we see a recovery in the immunology market with new patient levels already exceeding pre-COVID levels. So, we are optimistic about the recovery, specifically utilizing the metric of new patients. So, that's progressing well for the immunology market. When it comes to TREMFYA, it continues to deliver strong growth worldwide, with net trade sales growing in the quarter about 30%, despite of headwind of a prior period adjustment that has reduced about 750 basis points. So, a strong performance of TREMFYA. When it comes to share, I think it was commented that we capture about 2.5 points incremental in psoriasis and about a larger amount in psoriatic arthritis, where we are already the market share leader. It was three points in psoriatic arthritis. It's difficult to tell you where this is coming from. I mean we are assuming that this is going to be coming from older therapies that are there in the market, and that's where it's coming from. But clearly, TREMFYA is doing really well, both in psoriasis and in psoriatic arthritis. And psoriatic arthritis is the market-leading in new-to-brand share. We are also pleased with the fact that we have published recently first and best-in-class 5-year durability data, and also that we have been able to be the only IL-23 therapy to demonstrate inhibition of structural damage in PSA. So, we are very positive about the trajectory of TREMFYA, which is a reflection of the strength of our immunology franchise. Continuing with the future of TREMFYA, which I think it's important for you to consider, we are now fully enrolled in our trial in ulcerative colitis, and we are nearing fully enrollment completion in our trial in Crohn's disease. So, that predicates well for the growth of TREMFYA moving forward. Addition to that \u2013 in addition to that, we presented very encouraging and interesting data in IBD in combination of TREMFYA with SIMPONI, so guselkumab that show best-in-class results and best-in-class data, and we are very pleased with that. And also, if you look at our pipeline, we are also continuing to progress into Phase 2 with our own oral IL-23. So, very strong future of TREMFYA, one of the key products in our growth moving forward, a very strong future for our franchise in immunology. Thank you for the question and a great question. First, it's difficult for us to comment on the content of the legislation or the feasibility of that legislation passing. There has been a lot of ups and downs there. While we are very closely following the dynamics, the situation is still fluid. So, it's difficult for us to comment on the actual legislation or in the feasibility. Now, if we believe that the legislation is going to base on the language that we know from the Senate Finance Committee, as you pointed out, that will have a significant detrimental effect on the ability of the industry, of the companies to be able to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Just for perspective, the biopharmaceutical industry invested about $120 billion in R&D in 2020. Johnson & Johnson, ourselves, in our pharmaceutical business, we invested $12 billion in R&D in 2021. So, as a company that invests heavily in R&D, we can tell you that the type of legislation that was proposed by the Senate Finance Committee with Medicare price setting will have a chilling effect in innovation that will be translated in less new medicines for patients. Again, for perspective, since 2000, the pharmaceutical industry has introduced about 1,000 new medicines. The impact that this will have may affect the advances that we have in multiple areas that are still needed to be able to advance patient care. So, it's a very seamless situation that will affect innovation, will affect our ability to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Now, we are also engaging with different stakeholders in trying to educate them about the impact of this type of legislation and innovation. But at the same time, we also want to sit at the table and participate in discussions to address what we believe is the major issue, which is patient affordability and patient access, specifically in Part D. So, we think that, that's something that the industry has to address with the relevant stakeholders, and we are very willing to sit at the table and shoulder the consequences of being able to address the patient affordability issue. Now, I always have \u2013 I always need to remember to you that in a price-constrained environment, Johnson & Johnson performs relatively better than most of our peers and competitors based on a number of factors. First, our diversification. Second, we have about half of our sales that come outside of the U.S. And third, specifically in the pharmaceutical business, we have been able to deliver above-market growth in the face of mid-single digit niche price decreases. So, we know how to grow in a difficult pricing environment. As a matter of fact, all of our growth comes from volume. So, if you are thinking about where to be in these circumstances, Johnson & Johnson really, it's a good place based on its diversification and our ability to drive growth through volume. Thank you, everybody, for participating in the call. Again, very pleased with the solid results achieved by our teams year-to-date. It shows the quality and the market leadership of our franchises and the great execution of our company in the middle of these challenges. We are also making good progress in the three strategic priorities that I outlined at the outset of this call regarding the consumer separation and the creation of the new Johnson & Johnson, our ability to continue to grow in our pharmaceutical business through the STELARA patent expiration and our continued recovery and competitive growth and MedTech. As we conclude today, also a quick reminder on our recent ESG investor update, which highlighted progress against our 2025 Health for Humanity goals. I encourage all of you to listen to the webcast replay on our website if you didn't have a chance to do it already. We look forward to connecting with all of you again and keeping you updated on our continuous progress on future earnings calls. Thank you very much."

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJoe Wolk: Good morning. This is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our company's first quarter 2022 financial results and full year 2022 outlook. While many things have changed in the world since our last call, much has stayed the same for Johnson & Johnson. We continue to deliver reliable growth and generate meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to invest and advance our pipeline, increase our dividend for the 60th consecutive year and continued to make a positive impact across the landscape of health care. It is, however, important to take a few moments to recognize the current events that are impacting the world we're living in. Today, while we're all still managing through the global pandemic, as evidenced by the current surge of cases in China, we also acknowledge the increasing hardship brought on by the war in Ukraine. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and their families. Guided by our credo and grounded in our purpose, our hearts are with all those affected by these crises and hope for a rapid resolution to both. Now, I'd like to turn the program over to Jessica Moore, Vice President, Investor Relations, to take you through our Q1 results.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Joe. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by, Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medtech; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceutical. We have heard your feedback and are implementing a few enhancements this quarter. First, we are now providing select earlier phase clinical trial information on our pharmaceutical pipeline to streamline your data collection efforts from clinicaltrials.gov. Second, rather than sharing detailed business performance commentary on each part of the business, I will summarize the significant business drivers, leaving more time for Q&A. You can find additional detailed segment commentary in our earnings presentation. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now, let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% versus the first quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.7 points. In the US, sales increased 2.7%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 7.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 12.6%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.9% worldwide, 2.8% in the US and 12.9% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.32 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.67, representing increases of 3% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.2%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2021 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning in 2022, certain over-the-counter products previously reported under the Pharmaceutical segment have been reclassed to Consumer Health. These products represent roughly $100 million of sales per quarter. Please refer to the supplemental sales schedules for prior year restatements. Also, as stated in our 2021 10-K, effective January, our Medical Devices segment is now referred to as MedTech. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.8% with a decline of 3.4% in the US and growth of 4.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Worldwide growth was 1.6%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to ingredients and packaging availability as well as labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business, worth approximately 280 basis points worldwide and 500 basis points in the US. Adjusting for these constraints, Consumer Health delivered solid results, primarily due to above-market growth in OTC driven by increased TYLENOL, MOTRIN and upper respiratory product sales. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.9 billion increased 9.3% with growth of 2.9% in the US and 16.7% outside of the US. Base Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial execution, enabling us to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including six assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Base business growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and our paliperidone long-acting portfolio. Growth was partially offset by LOE pressures from both REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with decrease in IMBRUVICA and XARELTO sales. DARZALEX continues to drive very strong operational growth with sales increases of 40.3%, driven by subcutaneous formulation penetration and meaningful share gains across all lines of therapy and in all regions. IMBRUVICA sales declined 3.9% worldwide due to increased competition from novel oral agents, particularly in US. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive growth outside of the US despite ongoing competitive pressures. XARELTO sales declined 13.8% in the US, driven largely by a net unfavorable prior period price adjustment and increased cost for patient access, partially offset by continued demand and market growth. The COVID-19 vaccine also contributed approximately $500 million to sales in the quarter. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7 billion increased 8.5%, with growth of 5.6% in the US and growth of 11.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.6%. We see strong performance in Q1 driven by market recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share across most of the 11 priority platforms. We continue to monitor potential impacts on elective procedures driven by COVID-19 resurgences across various markets. Before highlighting the financial performance for the segment, I'd like to share a few notable first quarter MedTech events that demonstrate our stated aspirations of entering higher-growth market segments and continuing to build upon digital technologies across the portfolio. Two acquisitions were closed in the quarter, CrossRoads Extremity with a differentiated portfolio of bunion and hammertoes solutions in the fast-growing elective foot and ankle market; and CUPTIMIZE, which will be a new addition to the VELYS digital surgery platform of connected technologies. The CUPTIMIZE solution is designed to give surgeons an easy-to-use tool to better understand and address the impact of abnormal motion between the spine and pelvis in some patients who require total hip arthroplasty and may help reduce the risk of dislocation related to pelvic tilt. I am also pleased to share that Fast Company selected Johnson & Johnson MedTech as one its top 10 World's Most Innovative Health Companies of 2022, recognizing MedTech's success and commitment to delivering breakthrough scientific innovation and reimagining health in an increasingly digital world. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 17.4%, with double-digit growth in both the US and OUS regions, driven primarily by success of new products in electrophysiology, commercial execution and continued market recovery. Worldwide surgery grew 5%, driven by strong performance in wound closure and biosurgery where we continue to gain market share. MONARCH-enabled procedures now exceed 14,000 since launch, providing continued evidence of the adoption of MONARCH technology in patient treatment regimens. The worldwide Orthopedics franchise grew 5.6%, reflecting COVID-19 recovery, continued penetration in the US ambulatory surgery center channel or ASCs; and penetration of new product launches, such as enhancements to VELYS hip navigation, VELYS robotic-assisted solution and ATTUNE cementless knee system. Partially offsetting this growth was softness in spine procedures in the US. The worldwide Vision franchise continued its double-digit growth, growing 13.9% this quarter. Contact lenses global growth of 10.6% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 23.8%, with both the US and OUS posting growth above 20%, fueled by market recovery and share momentum due to the success of recently launched products, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. As a reminder, additional sales commentary for all of our segments can be found on the slides. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, driven by unfavorable mix in the MedTech business and commodity inflation in the Consumer Health business. Sales, marketing and administrative deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by higher brand marketing expenses in Consumer Health and timing of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical segment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. The $3.5 billion investment was an 8.9% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. In process, research and development reflects an impairment expense of $610 million for certain indications associated with bermekimab, the investigational compound acquired from XBiotech Inc. as disclosed in our previous SEC filings. This impairment was driven by the termination of development of bermekimab for atopic dermatitis based on efficacy data. The other income and expense line was net income of $102 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was the result of lapping prior year gains on the divestiture of Doxil, Calyx and EBRA in 2021, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs. This was partially offset by favorable returns associated with our employee benefit plans. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 12.2% versus 16.6% in the same period last year. The decreased tax rate was primarily driven by lower US income due to higher unrealized losses on securities and the impairment of bermekimab IP R&D compared to prior year divestiture gains. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.1% to 35.1% due to product mix, commodity inflation, increased brand marketing expense, portfolio progression in R&D and comparisons to gains from prior year divestitures. Pharmaceutical margin declined from 45.5% to 44.1%, primarily driven by timing of brand marketing expenses and general portfolio progression in R&D. MedTech margins declined from 30.6% to 27%, driven by unfavorable product mix. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 26.8% to 22.1%, due to commodity inflation and higher brand marketing expenses. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call back over to Joe Wolk.\nJoe Wolk: As Jess just mentioned, Johnson & Johnson posted solid performance for the quarter, continuing to invest in the business for the long-term success, while overcoming multiple macroeconomic headwinds, including inflationary pressures and higher input costs. These external challenges include limited availability and rising prices of certain commodities; as well as increased costs for labor, energy and transportation. These impacts are pervasive across the enterprise, but most notable in Consumer Health. We expect these pressures will continue to some degree throughout the remainder of 2022. However, mitigation efforts are underway, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. We are committed to sustaining supply of the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients want and need. Turning to our segments and notable events in the quarter. MedTech led our enterprise performance with nearly 9% adjusted operational sales growth. We continue to drive this business forward and are increasing the value of our pipeline through innovation, internally and externally. We were pleased to see a steady uptick in surgical procedures this quarter with the easing of COVID restrictions in many parts of the world, but we recognize that the situation is fluid, which requires monitoring. Building on more than 20 major new product launches in 2021, MedTech announced the addition of two new innovations to our ATTUNE portfolio, the ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing knee with AFFIXIUM 3DP Technology and the ATTUNE medial stabilized knee system. In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver above-market growth driven by volume as evidenced by our recently published 2021 Janssen US Transparency Report, which reflects our fifth consecutive year of price decreases across the portfolio despite inflationary pressures. We also continue to advance our Pharmaceutical pipeline. This quarter, we received FDA approval for Carvykti, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with our partner, Legend Biotech. We are partnering with clinics utilizing a phased approach to begin patient dosing, and the feedback to date has been positive. We also filed Teclistamab, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody seeking EMA approval, and we also received priority review from the FDA, potentially expanding our multiple myeloma portfolio further. In our Consumer Health business, we remain focused on delivering on our 2022 performance objectives, continuing to achieve above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while navigating industry-wide supply constraints that have primarily impacted our Skin Health/Beauty business. We continue to be excited about the activity related to the announcement we made in November on the creation of two new industry-leading companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health Company. For the new Johnson & Johnson, the portfolio will remain well diversified with 25 brands delivering over $1 billion in sales annually, holding market-leading positions across key therapeutic areas and franchises. The financial hallmarks of Johnson & Johnson will remain the same, including a well-defined capital allocation strategy, a disciplined approach to inorganic growth and a strong balance sheet, while also creating opportunities to sharpen focus on execution and clinically differentiated innovation. The new Consumer Health Company will also have a strong financial profile and be better positioned to drive incremental growth, realizing increased potential in new markets through a more agile operating model. The company will continue to deliver science-backed innovation and enhanced digital consumer-centric solutions. The Consumer Health separation team is making substantial progress related to our efforts in establishing the new independent company. As previously mentioned, we cannot disclose new financial information specific to Consumer Health in order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways. Our time lines remain unchanged. We anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health Company in the coming months, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with previous communications, we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment adhering to the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow for the quarter of nearly $3.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $30 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $3 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Internal innovation remains critical to our future growth and a top priority. In the first quarter, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first quarter of 2021. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps or play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. As I mentioned earlier, we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 60th consecutive year from $1.06 per share to $1.13 per share, an increase of 6.6%. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations. I'll start with comments on our COVID-19 vaccine and foreign exchange impacts, essentially the only items with updates from our January guidance. As market demand for all COVID-19 vaccines is currently challenged by global supply surplus and vaccine hesitancy in developing markets, we have made the decision to suspend guidance for sales of our COVID-19 vaccine. This will enable investors to focus on the performance of our core businesses, which drive the current and future value for investors. We are maintaining the total adjusted operational earnings per share guidance we provided in January, absorbing, if need be, the modest income impact from the COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding foreign exchange, as you know, we don't offer guidance or predictions on currency movements. But to give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.08, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.1 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.25 for reported adjusted earnings per share versus the calculation related to January's guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $2.5 billion on reported sales and $0.45 on reported adjusted earnings per share. All other line items for which we provide guidance remain the same as communicated in January. To reiterate, we are maintaining our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do understand that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations as you update your models. In Consumer Health, we expect supply constraints to continue throughout the year but not to the same extent in the second half. As a result, we anticipate that the back half performance will improve over the first half. For MedTech, while the first quarter demonstrated faster recovery than we anticipated, our full year expectations remain fairly intact. We anticipate continued market recovery and uptake from recently launched products and are monitoring the ever-changing COVID dynamics, particularly the surging cases in China. Similar to Consumer Health, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. As a reminder, with respect to growth rates, the second quarter was the strongest quarter for MedTech in 2021. The expectations for the Pharmaceutical base business remain the same. We anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth with relatively consistent growth throughout the remainder of the year. In summary, Johnson & Johnson had a solid start to the year despite managing macroeconomic headwinds, and we remain confident in our business. I would like to recognize the continued efforts of our 144,000 global colleagues focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions to our credo stakeholders. Their unwavering dedication and support continue to inspire. And on behalf of the executive team, I'd like to extend our gratitude. I am now pleased to welcome to the call, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Taubert, our Worldwide Chairs to address your questions. Kevin, can you please provide instructions and open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So many different places to go. But Joe, I'll start with M&A. You know, there were comments on the tape stating that you're eager to deploy cash to M&A, especially for devices. So maybe for you or Ashley, can you add more color to your thinking there and the types of opportunities to consider? You know, you've talked about reaching the top of the peer set in devices. That would seem to require a relatively large deal or a series of small to medium-sized deals to move the needle. Is that a fair way to think about it? Thanks for taking the question.\nJoe Wolk: Yes. So Larry, I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Ashley for some thoughts specific on Medical Devices. But before I answer, Larry, I do want to compliment you and your team for the foreign exchange report that you guys issued back, I think it was on April 13. That was just -- it's a tough topic to really grasp. And you guys did a fantastic job in assessing what it meant for the medical device industry. It was really a fantastic report. So well done. With respect to cash, as you heard us in January, we are reaching our lowest levels of net debt. And we remain very active. You could talk to Thibaut, Jennifer and Ashley, with respect to ideas that they are bringing forth. We continue to have the same principles that we've had historically. We want to make sure there's a strategic fit. And by that, I simply mean we've got capabilities. We've got scientific expertise. Perhaps it's just our scale that adds more value to that asset than where it currently resides. And then we want to make sure that we compensate risk -- compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf when we do so. I would not get overly locked into size. Johnson & Johnson, quite frankly, have been built through a number of smaller acquisitions, and really the outliers are these larger acquisitions. But we look at really the strategic merit and then the financial value creation and don't get locked in to saying something is too small or too big with respect to adding to our already dynamic internal portfolio and pipeline. Ashley, I don't know if you want to...\nAshley McEvoy: Yes. No, Larry, maybe before I get to M&A, just kind of some macro thoughts on MedTech in the quarter. I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We saw positive signs of the market recovery. Clearly, while COVID has not disappeared, health systems around the world are becoming increasingly more resistant with each passing wave. And as we know, the world is -- is a lot more equipped to manage the pandemic, and quite frankly, so is Johnson & Johnson. So encouraged to see in quarter one that we continue to maintain our path to above-market performance. We referenced that this is kind of a growth at scale, if you will, 11, $1 billion platforms, really most of them growing or maintaining share. And we saw robust sales growth across all four of our franchises in all four of our regions. Some standout, encouraging to see both vision surgery and Vision Care, both double-digit performance and growing market share, really fueled by innovation in ACUVUE and TECNIS. We are the world leader in electrophysiology, still a category that has significant under penetration. We've had 11 consecutive years of double-digit performance and really significantly enhanced our share gain. We're the world leader in biosurgery. The business was up almost 10%, really driven by a clinically differentiated portfolio. And then finally, and enthusiastically, I say we had strong performance in joints really by penetrating some new sites of care like ASCs, both with hips and knees. So when I look forward, I'm encouraged by the organic agenda that we see in innovation, like with the likes of the FDA approval on ACUVUE Theravision, the first drug-eluting contact lens. As Joe mentioned earlier, around really shoring up high-growth segments in knees with ATTUNE fixed bearing, and then really with CERENOVUS the launch of EmboGad, the balloon catheter. So continue to advance robotics and digital surgery. You'll hear us talk about MONARCH 14,000 cases with a big pipeline of new indications, and then VELYS completing over 2,000 cases. So when I think about the future of M&A, Larry, we're going to continue to do tuck-ins and to really digitize the patient experience. You heard us talk about CUPTIMIZE as an example around really adding a precise delivery to hit navigation to improve outcomes. You're going to see us continue to penetrate fast-growing segments like what we have in neurovascular, as an example, 90% of our capital deployment has been to $1 billion or more, but we do intend to make sure that we are well positioned to be in the highest growth end state markets.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe Ashley, just following up on some of your MedTech comments. Can you specifically comment on China in terms of the impact you're currently seeing to the business and your outlook for that market specifically, given some of the lockdowns that we're seeing there? And then my kind of core question was just on IMBRUVICA. It seems like prescriptions here are really starting to see some erosion. I'm trying to understand the dynamics you're expecting going forward. So is this -- especially maybe in the US market, are you expecting that this erosion continues? Or do you see dynamics in place that we could start to see some of those prescription trends start to stabilize a bit? Thanks so much.\nAshley McEvoy: Yeah, sure, Chris. So first, we have, I would say, a very strong and healthy business in China. We're the world \u2013 we are number one in MedTech in China. We have a very diversified portfolio from surgery to orthopedics to interventional as well as vision. We did experience an impact probably in the March time frame due to the recent surge of the viruses happening and the lockdowns, particularly in Shanghai and now other regions. We do anticipate that to continue in April and through the month of May. But like we've seen, I think China might come down a bit faster, but it comes back faster, too. We have very strong leadership there, and there are a lot of patients that need care. I'll turn it to Jennifer maybe to talk about your second question.\nJennifer Taubert: Great. Thanks a lot. Hi, Chris and hello, everybody. A few comments on the Pharmaceutical business, and then I'll get to the question on IMBRUVICA. First, for our pharm business, I was really proud that we delivered $12.9 billion in worldwide sales. We're definitely above-market adjusted operational growth of 9.3%. And this is our sixth quarter where we achieved worldwide sales exceeding $12 billion. And as I look across the globe, the growth was really broadly based across our portfolio in the regions, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America. During the course of the quarter, we really continued to maximize the value of our key brands, so strong double-digit growth across six of them, including DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA, [Privado] (ph) and EDURANT. And we also had a number of important milestones, the first being the FDA approval of Carvykti, which is our first cell therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The teclistamab filing in the EU was mentioned. The FDA approved expanded label indications for CABENUVA to be administered every two months for the treatment of HIV in virologically suppressed adults and adolescents. And we presented great new data on TREMFYA in our approved indications of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as from our Phase II studies, where we're evaluating the product in Crohn's Disease and also in UC. So if we take a look at IMBRUVICA more specifically, IMBRUVICA sales did decline for the quarter, 3.9%, and this really was a US story. Outside the US, our sales actually grew 4.5%. In the US, performance was impacted by both competitive factors with a number of new competitors in the market as well as market softness. We haven't seen that market fully rebound to the pre-COVID levels yet. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA has really changed the standard of care for adults with CLL and other B-cell malignancies. And it is the only BTKI that\u2019s demonstrated overall survival and a high rate of progression-free survival at five years with up to eight years of safety follow-up. So, we remain really confident in the efficacy and safety profile of the product. It's the market share leader and continues to be the most comprehensively studied and prescribed BTKI with over 250,000 patients worldwide. So we continue to work to develop the asset. We do see further growth opportunities through the introduction of new indications and new combination therapies, as we take a look at IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax that we're working to develop and we filed in the EU. We're also taking a look at first line [ph] and CL and really trying to bring that forward. So I think you can anticipate there will continue to be strong competition in that market. We continue to believe in and invest in IMBRUVICA.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about the middle of the income statement with all of the multiple headwinds on those factors. How do you think about managing it? What are the levers to pull? And how do you think about raising prices in this environment for each of your key divisions?\nJoe Wolk: Yes, good morning, Joanne. Thanks for the question. With respect to operating margins overall, which is really, I think, at the heart of your question, in the front -- the first quarter, I should say, we do tend to adopt a little bit more of an aggressive approach to advertising and promotion and hopes of getting the full year benefit of that promotion to the topline lift throughout the year. And I would say on R&D, it's also a little bit front-end loaded this year, simply from the standpoint of the progression of our pharmaceutical pipeline, as well as digital robotic surgery. So in pharmaceuticals, think about nipocalimab, our RSV vaccine, those had very nice progression. Teclistamab may be moving a little bit faster than we anticipated, as well as being able to launch Carvykti. There was a healthy amount of inflation built into our P&L in the January guidance. What I think our teams have seen in the -- let's say, the first four months of this year is an uptick in that inflationary impact of about 10% or 15%. So still very manageable. Again, as you heard in some of the prepared remarks, we anticipate that that inflationary pressure as well as commodity scarcity will subside a little bit in the second quarter and then hopefully more pronounced in the second half of this year. If it doesn't, it's certainly something that will keep our attention. And we have the resources to adjust accordingly to make sure that we not only meet the needs of long-term value creation, but also meet short-term performance expectations. So we all think it's very manageable at this point in time, but it's something that we're not taking for granted. We're being very active with cost initiative programs. As we look to separate the two companies, we are looking at ways to streamline technology, processes, things that will lead to leverage on the P&L.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Perhaps directed at the Pharmaceutical segment for Jennifer. Two products I'd like to focus on, one being STELARA and the other on XARELTO. With STELARA, could you perhaps elaborate a little bit more in terms of some of the underlying dynamics across the various indications, i.e., the derm versus perhaps the IBD in terms of what the growth trends and outlook you're seeing and you expect there? And then for XARELTO, part of your commentary in the prepared segment discussed and mentioned about patient access. Could you just elaborate a little bit further on how that was an impact on the commercial dynamics? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Sure. Thanks for the question. So let me start off with STELARA. So STELARA sales were $2.29 billion in the first quarter, and that was 9% growth. And we continue to see a lot of strength in STELARA. Ex-US, the product had nearly 18% growth. In the US, what we saw was growth around 3.6%. And what this really was due to, we saw an impact in the US due to the Omicron variant and the impact that it actually had on staffing resources that particularly impacted a number of areas where you had more resource-intensive delivery of care, and GI offices was definitely one. As we take a look at Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, our share positions remain strong and with very strong positive momentum. We actually gained over five share points in CD and six share points in ulcerative colitis. So really strong growth and momentum. And with -- in psoriasis, as anticipated with TREMFYA and a very strong growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we expected the STELARA sales there to start tailing off, and that's in line with our expectations. So we continue to have a very strong positive outlook for STELARA going through the rest of the year in CD and in Crohn's -- excuse me, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, where we've really been realizing the growth. And likewise, when you take a look at TREMFYA, we saw 44.5% growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. So together, really, really nice performance there. Question on XARELTO. So XARELTO in the US, we did see sales decline. That was largely driven by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment. And most of this has actually been a positive adjustment that took place in 2021. So when you do the comparable, it was negative. And so that was really due to the vast majority of that. With Xarelto, we continue to see nice share gains and growth at a prescription level across the indications, whether we're talking about CAD and PAD, really the newest indication set, but also across AFib and VTE. And so it really was around the net unfavorable PPA and a little bit of channel mix as well with some of the mix shifting into 340B and Medicaid in some of the lower-priced channels.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about CARVYKTI. And what gives you confidence in your ability to meet some of the manufacturing complexity associated with CARVYKTI? And how much capacity do you think you'll be able to bring online this year, both in the US and potentially globally as well? Thank you. \nJennifer Taubert: Thanks for the question. So we're real proud about our approval and our launch to-date on CARVYKTI. What I can say is that it is going well and it is on track with our expectations. We're real pleased. As you know, this is a customized therapy where the supply chain is literally built around each patient. We've got about a four week to five week period that goes from the collection of the cells, the processing and manufacturing and the return shipment of the final product and then ultimately the infusion back in to the patient at the treatment center. As we have mentioned before we really are taking a thoughtful and a phased approach to scaling this launch, to ensure a predictable and a reliable experience for the patients and for the treatment centers. We really tried to learn from the other launches in the market in this area. And so far, we're off to a really good start there and have been very pleased with the feedback that we're getting back from our customers. So we have activated our initial round of treatment centers. And we did this based on folks who were very well-experienced from our clinical trials and also very broadly dispersed throughout the US and help ensure patient access. We're working through all of the orders and the slots that we have and actually have product now that's been shipped back -- has been manufactured and shipped back to the patients for infusion into the patients. So we're going to continue in a planned and thoughtful responsible approach to this scaling, both in the United States as well as we do -- as we scale outside the US and throughout the world as well. Now we discussed before around lentivirus. Because there is an industry-wide shortage of lentivirus, that is something that we are also working and investing in to scale all of our internal capabilities to be able to meet the demand, both now in our initial launches in the relapsed/refractory setting as well as our ultimate goal to be able to move into first-line setting here. And so we would have an internal control on that as well. So hope this answers your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Joe, since Joaquin made some public commentary on his commitment to support Ashley and her team to drive revenue growth acceleration in the Mega Devices unit, your focus has been on M&A opportunities. But how should we think about the level of internal investment to fuel growth of the devices franchise? You don't break out the percentage of R&D spend allocated to devices. But one data point we do have is from the 2019 pharma day when you related $8.4 billion of the $11 billion in R& D expense from 2018 went to pharma initiatives, so that's north of 75%. But just \u2013 I mean, has that stepped up just the level of investment in the Devices business over the last couple of years? And will that step up even further? And just to be clear, Ashley did not plant this question with our team.\nJoe Wolk: I'm going to check the transcript on that, Josh, just to be sure. But listen, I think what you would hear, as Joaquin was sitting here, is that he supports all the businesses with respect to innovation. We realize that our calling card is innovation, and we're going to have growth across all of our franchises when we have products that matter that are differentiated, that are beyond the current standard of care and meeting consumer needs as well. I actually want to credit Ashley and her team for the way they've managed their P&L. They've been conscious about moving more of their investment into R&D. You saw a record number of 20 plus new product launches last year that are considered meaningful. We're going to be very close to probably a very similar number this year. And so that portfolio has taken very much the same approach that I would say Pharmaceuticals did almost a decade ago when the focus is very well understood and where we want to play because we've got a strategic or competitive advantage will be capitalized upon. I don't know, Ashley, if you want to add anything more, but I think that certainly, there is continued support, but a lot of the credit goes to Ashley and her team in terms of managing their levels of investment throughout the P&L.\nAshley McEvoy: Thanks, Joe. I mean, Josh, I would say that we are investing at a competitive level, and I'm really pleased with the state of execution. We are \u2013 we have, in our pipeline right now, 27, $100 million-plus eNPV projects. That number three years ago was six. So they continue to focus the pipeline on medium to higher growth segments and really execute and we're off to a good start in 2022.\nJoe Wolk: I would maybe underscore too is that gives us the confidence to go out and add in inorganic opportunities when the opportunity presents itself using the criteria of strategic fit as well as financial value creation. So a stronger internal pipeline that gets hopefully success out in the acquisition markets.\nJennifer Taubert: Just to reference our 10-K, we do provide the breakout of R&D by segment on an annual basis for reference.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Jennifer, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the COVID recovery in the Pharma segment. I know you touched on staffing issues on the gas trip [Audio Gap]?\nJennifer Taubert: Yeah. So I understand Terry's comment really was around the US and what we're seeing in terms of COVID. So as we exited last year, really in the December time frame and entered this year into really January and February, we did see the Omicron variant impact the US business. And what we saw there really, as already mentioned before, we did see staffing shortages because so many people got sick. People weren't able to go into work. And so in a higher \u2013 more intensive resource settings in some of the markets, we did see slowdown in terms of delayed visits and new patient starts. What we are seeing now is we're looking towards the end of March and in early April, we're seeing nice recovery there. And so this really, hopefully was something really just at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and it does look to be more specific to the US than to any of the other markets.\nJoe Wolk: Thanks. Jennifer. Thibaut, maybe give some insight, too, on the consumer segment and how COVID is impacting. Obviously, it was much more tumultuous I'd say, in 2020 and 2021. But what are you seeing to the early start of this year?\nThibaut Mongon: Look, clearly, we continue to see the impact of COVID on the life of our consumers. And that has an impact -- the differentiated impact by category. We are looking at China very specifically right now to see how the situation evolves there. What I would say that COVID has really shifted consumer behavior to digital space and digital solutions. And so -- and we see it in the continued growth of our e-commerce channel, representing more and more of our business. So that's what makes all more resilient is ability to count on multiple channels is something that is showing us well in a provident environment. Having said that, we need to continue to monitor how the situation evolves around the world.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks. Thank so much for taking the question. So maybe for Ashley. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on med devices in Q1 and the trajectory exiting March. You had pretty impressive growth across the board, so congrats on that. But investors are often trying to think to just figure out the difference between inpatient segments like orthopedics or cardio or advanced surgery and how those are recovering potentially at different rates in the US? And what you might be seeing there? As well as any color you could provide on how, say, Europe and Japan overseas developed markets compared with the recovery trends we've seen in the US? Thanks.\nAshley McEvoy: Thanks, Matt for the question. And it's April 2022, we're still talking about this, so just huge acknowledgment for our health care workers who are still battling through this. But I would tell you, EMEA really bounced back nicely in quarter one. It was pretty broad-based within EMEA. I would say, Asia with the exception of China recently also bounced back, and then US really gained momentum. I always look at two data points in the US as an example. I look at like, how were diagnostic procedures performing in the US and then how are surgical procedures performing. And probably at our trough when Omicron was hitting in the US in January, we had about flat diagnostic procedures, and we were looking at surgical procedures down near double digit, down 10%. Encouragingly, as we exited March, we started to see diagnostic procedures tick up to high single digit and start to see a flattening of surgical procedures. I expect in the month of April in the US to see it go north of 2019 levels, really driven by cardio cardiac ablation, bariatrics and colorectal surgery.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I just had a couple. Jennifer, in the myeloma market, we'll see REVLIMID generic soon. And I realize that combinations with DARZALEX are standard of care, but what are your expectations for broader market disruption going forward, either from a pricing or share perspective? And then a quick follow-up on the M&A front for Joe. When you think about the P&L or cash flow impact from the consumer separation, to what degree does this inform or impact plans for a larger scale BD or M&A for either a MedTech or Pharma? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: So thanks for the opportunity to talk about our multiple myeloma portfolio in response to your question. So as we take a look at the myeloma market despite the advances to date in therapies, there is still so much unmet need there, given the underlying heterogeneity of the disease. And so it's really important that there are treatment choices. And what we're really trying to do is to have a strong portfolio of highly effected -- highly effective treatments and actually ultimately shoot for a cure. And so as we take a look at the market with DARZALEX -- in DARZALEX FASPRO right now, we're really seeing this as a foundational therapy multiple myeloma. And so irrespective of others and LOE and those types of things, you noted, it's a lot of combination therapy and things like that. That does not fundamentally change the opportunity for DARZALEX and FASPRO. What I'm also really excited about is then you add in CARVYKTI that was recently approved, as we mentioned, for triple refractory multiple myeloma. And we really think that this will ultimately become a preferred treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also mentioned teclistamab in the filing of teclistamab. And this really is the first-ever BCMA CD3 specific. And we think that this is going to be a great off-the-shelf option and for patients who really are triple-class exposed and who are really not eligible for CARVYKTI or don't have access. And then in the future, we're not stopping there. We're also working on Talquetamab, and this would be the first and potentially best-in-class GPRC5D bispecific that we think could be potentially sequenced combined to help transform outcomes. And so as we take a look at our portfolio, we really think that these assets are additive and complementary versus something where they would be cannibalizing each other. And we really think that these are the important advances that are going to really help transform multiple myeloma in the future and going forward versus any of the older therapies.\nJoe Wolk: And Geoff, with respect to cash flow and M&A, I think I'll answer that in two parts. I think short term, we certainly have the credit rating to warrant more firepower should we need it. As you have observed, our cash flow generation over the last couple of years has ticked up to new levels, north of $20 billion or around $20 billion from when we were just maybe $17 billion a few years ago. As the consumer company operates, I think that's going to be actually liberating for both sides. We still have opportunities to improve our cash flow with inventory management and receivables. But as we move to a higher growth segment, we think we'll be able to generate similar cash flow with a higher level of sales growth, managing the P&L appropriately. So I've got every confidence that we'll be able to do small, medium and large scale acquisitions should the right opportunity present itself. I also think it's liberating for the Consumer Health segment because they'll be able to focus their cash flow generation to value-creating opportunities through their particular lens being fit for purpose in a digitized environment that Thibaut spoke to. So whether it's near-term or long-term, I think we're in a very good position to utilize today's cash and hopefully that which should we generate tomorrow. Kevin, maybe we've got time for one more question?\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. This is a question for Ashley. And is the commentary around the ASC penetration. And I'm just curious, Ashley, as that site of care becomes increasingly important, where you guys think you are relative to the market from a penetration perspective? And where you think you can grow meaningful growth driver will your recent success in the ASC be over the next few years? Thanks so much.\nAshley McEvoy: Well, thank you, Danielle. Appreciate the question and hope you are well. We -- in US, the ASCs, I think, are -- it's still relatively low penetration, I would tell, from a macro US, less than 20%, but I think it's the fastest growing as we know. In a COVID environment, we've seen the model evolve to create a safe, more patient-friendly experience that addresses a patient sentiment of not wanting to go into a hospital setting. Certain procedures have gone there early sooner than later. I'd say hips or migraine and knees, less spine per se, less complicated. Obviously, trauma case is still happening in the hospital setting. We've done a lot of work recently to modify our business model to make it a capital-efficient flow, if you will, in inventory management, on the personalization of care using digital assets to kind of your pre-op and your post-op experience less full of friction. And we're taking a lot of experience in the US ASCs to really what we're doing in China in the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 cities as well as we deliver care. So I'm optimistic that this channel will continue to evolve. I do think that we think we start competitiveness there, and we're making sure that we really have a sustainable business model going forward. Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those who we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks.\nJoe Wolk: Great. Thanks, Jess. And as Jess alluded to, we certainly do appreciate your questions and the chance to interact with you. I'd like to remind everybody as we close that we do have the opportunity to engage with shareholders at next week's annual meeting on April 28. Also be on the lookout for an update on our commitments to ESG. On June 8, we will be issuing our Health for Humanity Report, which is an in-depth review on the progress we are making on our 2025 goals. Thank you for your time and your interest in Johnson & Johnson. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by, Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medtech; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceutical. We have heard your feedback and are implementing a few enhancements this quarter. First, we are now providing select earlier phase clinical trial information on our pharmaceutical pipeline to streamline your data collection efforts from clinicaltrials.gov. Second, rather than sharing detailed business performance commentary on each part of the business, I will summarize the significant business drivers, leaving more time for Q&A. You can find additional detailed segment commentary in our earnings presentation. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now, let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% versus the first quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.7 points. In the US, sales increased 2.7%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 7.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 12.6%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.9% worldwide, 2.8% in the US and 12.9% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.32 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.67, representing increases of 3% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.2%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2021 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning in 2022, certain over-the-counter products previously reported under the Pharmaceutical segment have been reclassed to Consumer Health. These products represent roughly $100 million of sales per quarter. Please refer to the supplemental sales schedules for prior year restatements. Also, as stated in our 2021 10-K, effective January, our Medical Devices segment is now referred to as MedTech. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.8% with a decline of 3.4% in the US and growth of 4.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Worldwide growth was 1.6%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to ingredients and packaging availability as well as labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business, worth approximately 280 basis points worldwide and 500 basis points in the US. Adjusting for these constraints, Consumer Health delivered solid results, primarily due to above-market growth in OTC driven by increased TYLENOL, MOTRIN and upper respiratory product sales. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.9 billion increased 9.3% with growth of 2.9% in the US and 16.7% outside of the US. Base Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial execution, enabling us to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including six assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Base business growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and our paliperidone long-acting portfolio. Growth was partially offset by LOE pressures from both REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with decrease in IMBRUVICA and XARELTO sales. DARZALEX continues to drive very strong operational growth with sales increases of 40.3%, driven by subcutaneous formulation penetration and meaningful share gains across all lines of therapy and in all regions. IMBRUVICA sales declined 3.9% worldwide due to increased competition from novel oral agents, particularly in US. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive growth outside of the US despite ongoing competitive pressures. XARELTO sales declined 13.8% in the US, driven largely by a net unfavorable prior period price adjustment and increased cost for patient access, partially offset by continued demand and market growth. The COVID-19 vaccine also contributed approximately $500 million to sales in the quarter. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7 billion increased 8.5%, with growth of 5.6% in the US and growth of 11.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.6%. We see strong performance in Q1 driven by market recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share across most of the 11 priority platforms. We continue to monitor potential impacts on elective procedures driven by COVID-19 resurgences across various markets. Before highlighting the financial performance for the segment, I'd like to share a few notable first quarter MedTech events that demonstrate our stated aspirations of entering higher-growth market segments and continuing to build upon digital technologies across the portfolio. Two acquisitions were closed in the quarter, CrossRoads Extremity with a differentiated portfolio of bunion and hammertoes solutions in the fast-growing elective foot and ankle market; and CUPTIMIZE, which will be a new addition to the VELYS digital surgery platform of connected technologies. The CUPTIMIZE solution is designed to give surgeons an easy-to-use tool to better understand and address the impact of abnormal motion between the spine and pelvis in some patients who require total hip arthroplasty and may help reduce the risk of dislocation related to pelvic tilt. I am also pleased to share that Fast Company selected Johnson & Johnson MedTech as one its top 10 World's Most Innovative Health Companies of 2022, recognizing MedTech's success and commitment to delivering breakthrough scientific innovation and reimagining health in an increasingly digital world. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 17.4%, with double-digit growth in both the US and OUS regions, driven primarily by success of new products in electrophysiology, commercial execution and continued market recovery. Worldwide surgery grew 5%, driven by strong performance in wound closure and biosurgery where we continue to gain market share. MONARCH-enabled procedures now exceed 14,000 since launch, providing continued evidence of the adoption of MONARCH technology in patient treatment regimens. The worldwide Orthopedics franchise grew 5.6%, reflecting COVID-19 recovery, continued penetration in the US ambulatory surgery center channel or ASCs; and penetration of new product launches, such as enhancements to VELYS hip navigation, VELYS robotic-assisted solution and ATTUNE cementless knee system. Partially offsetting this growth was softness in spine procedures in the US. The worldwide Vision franchise continued its double-digit growth, growing 13.9% this quarter. Contact lenses global growth of 10.6% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 23.8%, with both the US and OUS posting growth above 20%, fueled by market recovery and share momentum due to the success of recently launched products, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. As a reminder, additional sales commentary for all of our segments can be found on the slides. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, driven by unfavorable mix in the MedTech business and commodity inflation in the Consumer Health business. Sales, marketing and administrative deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by higher brand marketing expenses in Consumer Health and timing of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical segment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. The $3.5 billion investment was an 8.9% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. In process, research and development reflects an impairment expense of $610 million for certain indications associated with bermekimab, the investigational compound acquired from XBiotech Inc. as disclosed in our previous SEC filings. This impairment was driven by the termination of development of bermekimab for atopic dermatitis based on efficacy data. The other income and expense line was net income of $102 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was the result of lapping prior year gains on the divestiture of Doxil, Calyx and EBRA in 2021, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs. This was partially offset by favorable returns associated with our employee benefit plans. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 12.2% versus 16.6% in the same period last year. The decreased tax rate was primarily driven by lower US income due to higher unrealized losses on securities and the impairment of bermekimab IP R&D compared to prior year divestiture gains. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.1% to 35.1% due to product mix, commodity inflation, increased brand marketing expense, portfolio progression in R&D and comparisons to gains from prior year divestitures. Pharmaceutical margin declined from 45.5% to 44.1%, primarily driven by timing of brand marketing expenses and general portfolio progression in R&D. MedTech margins declined from 30.6% to 27%, driven by unfavorable product mix. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 26.8% to 22.1%, due to commodity inflation and higher brand marketing expenses. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call back over to Joe Wolk. Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those who we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks."

            "name": "Jennifer Taubert",
            "content": "Great. Thanks a lot. Hi, Chris and hello, everybody. A few comments on the Pharmaceutical business, and then I'll get to the question on IMBRUVICA. First, for our pharm business, I was really proud that we delivered $12.9 billion in worldwide sales. We're definitely above-market adjusted operational growth of 9.3%. And this is our sixth quarter where we achieved worldwide sales exceeding $12 billion. And as I look across the globe, the growth was really broadly based across our portfolio in the regions, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America. During the course of the quarter, we really continued to maximize the value of our key brands, so strong double-digit growth across six of them, including DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA, [Privado] (ph) and EDURANT. And we also had a number of important milestones, the first being the FDA approval of Carvykti, which is our first cell therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The teclistamab filing in the EU was mentioned. The FDA approved expanded label indications for CABENUVA to be administered every two months for the treatment of HIV in virologically suppressed adults and adolescents. And we presented great new data on TREMFYA in our approved indications of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as from our Phase II studies, where we're evaluating the product in Crohn's Disease and also in UC. So if we take a look at IMBRUVICA more specifically, IMBRUVICA sales did decline for the quarter, 3.9%, and this really was a US story. Outside the US, our sales actually grew 4.5%. In the US, performance was impacted by both competitive factors with a number of new competitors in the market as well as market softness. We haven't seen that market fully rebound to the pre-COVID levels yet. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA has really changed the standard of care for adults with CLL and other B-cell malignancies. And it is the only BTKI that's demonstrated overall survival and a high rate of progression-free survival at five years with up to eight years of safety follow-up. So, we remain really confident in the efficacy and safety profile of the product. It's the market share leader and continues to be the most comprehensively studied and prescribed BTKI with over 250,000 patients worldwide. So we continue to work to develop the asset. We do see further growth opportunities through the introduction of new indications and new combination therapies, as we take a look at IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax that we're working to develop and we filed in the EU. We're also taking a look at first line [ph] and CL and really trying to bring that forward. So I think you can anticipate there will continue to be strong competition in that market. We continue to believe in and invest in IMBRUVICA. Sure. Thanks for the question. So let me start off with STELARA. So STELARA sales were $2.29 billion in the first quarter, and that was 9% growth. And we continue to see a lot of strength in STELARA. Ex-US, the product had nearly 18% growth. In the US, what we saw was growth around 3.6%. And what this really was due to, we saw an impact in the US due to the Omicron variant and the impact that it actually had on staffing resources that particularly impacted a number of areas where you had more resource-intensive delivery of care, and GI offices was definitely one. As we take a look at Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, our share positions remain strong and with very strong positive momentum. We actually gained over five share points in CD and six share points in ulcerative colitis. So really strong growth and momentum. And with -- in psoriasis, as anticipated with TREMFYA and a very strong growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we expected the STELARA sales there to start tailing off, and that's in line with our expectations. So we continue to have a very strong positive outlook for STELARA going through the rest of the year in CD and in Crohn's -- excuse me, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, where we've really been realizing the growth. And likewise, when you take a look at TREMFYA, we saw 44.5% growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. So together, really, really nice performance there. Question on XARELTO. So XARELTO in the US, we did see sales decline. That was largely driven by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment. And most of this has actually been a positive adjustment that took place in 2021. So when you do the comparable, it was negative. And so that was really due to the vast majority of that. With Xarelto, we continue to see nice share gains and growth at a prescription level across the indications, whether we're talking about CAD and PAD, really the newest indication set, but also across AFib and VTE. And so it really was around the net unfavorable PPA and a little bit of channel mix as well with some of the mix shifting into 340B and Medicaid in some of the lower-priced channels. Thanks for the question. So we're real proud about our approval and our launch to-date on CARVYKTI. What I can say is that it is going well and it is on track with our expectations. We're real pleased. As you know, this is a customized therapy where the supply chain is literally built around each patient. We've got about a four week to five week period that goes from the collection of the cells, the processing and manufacturing and the return shipment of the final product and then ultimately the infusion back in to the patient at the treatment center. As we have mentioned before we really are taking a thoughtful and a phased approach to scaling this launch, to ensure a predictable and a reliable experience for the patients and for the treatment centers. We really tried to learn from the other launches in the market in this area. And so far, we're off to a really good start there and have been very pleased with the feedback that we're getting back from our customers. So we have activated our initial round of treatment centers. And we did this based on folks who were very well-experienced from our clinical trials and also very broadly dispersed throughout the US and help ensure patient access. We're working through all of the orders and the slots that we have and actually have product now that's been shipped back -- has been manufactured and shipped back to the patients for infusion into the patients. So we're going to continue in a planned and thoughtful responsible approach to this scaling, both in the United States as well as we do -- as we scale outside the US and throughout the world as well. Now we discussed before around lentivirus. Because there is an industry-wide shortage of lentivirus, that is something that we are also working and investing in to scale all of our internal capabilities to be able to meet the demand, both now in our initial launches in the relapsed/refractory setting as well as our ultimate goal to be able to move into first-line setting here. And so we would have an internal control on that as well. So hope this answers your question. Just to reference our 10-K, we do provide the breakout of R&D by segment on an annual basis for reference. Yeah. So I understand Terry's comment really was around the US and what we're seeing in terms of COVID. So as we exited last year, really in the December time frame and entered this year into really January and February, we did see the Omicron variant impact the US business. And what we saw there really, as already mentioned before, we did see staffing shortages because so many people got sick. People weren't able to go into work. And so in a higher \u2013 more intensive resource settings in some of the markets, we did see slowdown in terms of delayed visits and new patient starts. What we are seeing now is we're looking towards the end of March and in early April, we're seeing nice recovery there. And so this really, hopefully was something really just at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and it does look to be more specific to the US than to any of the other markets. So thanks for the opportunity to talk about our multiple myeloma portfolio in response to your question. So as we take a look at the myeloma market despite the advances to date in therapies, there is still so much unmet need there, given the underlying heterogeneity of the disease. And so it's really important that there are treatment choices. And what we're really trying to do is to have a strong portfolio of highly effected -- highly effective treatments and actually ultimately shoot for a cure. And so as we take a look at the market with DARZALEX -- in DARZALEX FASPRO right now, we're really seeing this as a foundational therapy multiple myeloma. And so irrespective of others and LOE and those types of things, you noted, it's a lot of combination therapy and things like that. That does not fundamentally change the opportunity for DARZALEX and FASPRO. What I'm also really excited about is then you add in CARVYKTI that was recently approved, as we mentioned, for triple refractory multiple myeloma. And we really think that this will ultimately become a preferred treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also mentioned teclistamab in the filing of teclistamab. And this really is the first-ever BCMA CD3 specific. And we think that this is going to be a great off-the-shelf option and for patients who really are triple-class exposed and who are really not eligible for CARVYKTI or don't have access. And then in the future, we're not stopping there. We're also working on Talquetamab, and this would be the first and potentially best-in-class GPRC5D bispecific that we think could be potentially sequenced combined to help transform outcomes. And so as we take a look at our portfolio, we really think that these assets are additive and complementary versus something where they would be cannibalizing each other. And we really think that these are the important advances that are going to really help transform multiple myeloma in the future and going forward versus any of the older therapies."

            "name": "Ashley McEvoy",
            "content": "Yes. No, Larry, maybe before I get to M&A, just kind of some macro thoughts on MedTech in the quarter. I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We saw positive signs of the market recovery. Clearly, while COVID has not disappeared, health systems around the world are becoming increasingly more resistant with each passing wave. And as we know, the world is -- is a lot more equipped to manage the pandemic, and quite frankly, so is Johnson & Johnson. So encouraged to see in quarter one that we continue to maintain our path to above-market performance. We referenced that this is kind of a growth at scale, if you will, 11, $1 billion platforms, really most of them growing or maintaining share. And we saw robust sales growth across all four of our franchises in all four of our regions. Some standout, encouraging to see both vision surgery and Vision Care, both double-digit performance and growing market share, really fueled by innovation in ACUVUE and TECNIS. We are the world leader in electrophysiology, still a category that has significant under penetration. We've had 11 consecutive years of double-digit performance and really significantly enhanced our share gain. We're the world leader in biosurgery. The business was up almost 10%, really driven by a clinically differentiated portfolio. And then finally, and enthusiastically, I say we had strong performance in joints really by penetrating some new sites of care like ASCs, both with hips and knees. So when I look forward, I'm encouraged by the organic agenda that we see in innovation, like with the likes of the FDA approval on ACUVUE Theravision, the first drug-eluting contact lens. As Joe mentioned earlier, around really shoring up high-growth segments in knees with ATTUNE fixed bearing, and then really with CERENOVUS the launch of EmboGad, the balloon catheter. So continue to advance robotics and digital surgery. You'll hear us talk about MONARCH 14,000 cases with a big pipeline of new indications, and then VELYS completing over 2,000 cases. So when I think about the future of M&A, Larry, we're going to continue to do tuck-ins and to really digitize the patient experience. You heard us talk about CUPTIMIZE as an example around really adding a precise delivery to hit navigation to improve outcomes. You're going to see us continue to penetrate fast-growing segments like what we have in neurovascular, as an example, 90% of our capital deployment has been to $1 billion or more, but we do intend to make sure that we are well positioned to be in the highest growth end state markets. Yeah, sure, Chris. So first, we have, I would say, a very strong and healthy business in China. We're the world \u2013 we are number one in MedTech in China. We have a very diversified portfolio from surgery to orthopedics to interventional as well as vision. We did experience an impact probably in the March time frame due to the recent surge of the viruses happening and the lockdowns, particularly in Shanghai and now other regions. We do anticipate that to continue in April and through the month of May. But like we've seen, I think China might come down a bit faster, but it comes back faster, too. We have very strong leadership there, and there are a lot of patients that need care. I'll turn it to Jennifer maybe to talk about your second question. Thanks, Joe. I mean, Josh, I would say that we are investing at a competitive level, and I'm really pleased with the state of execution. We are \u2013 we have, in our pipeline right now, 27, $100 million-plus eNPV projects. That number three years ago was six. So they continue to focus the pipeline on medium to higher growth segments and really execute and we're off to a good start in 2022. Thanks, Matt for the question. And it's April 2022, we're still talking about this, so just huge acknowledgment for our health care workers who are still battling through this. But I would tell you, EMEA really bounced back nicely in quarter one. It was pretty broad-based within EMEA. I would say, Asia with the exception of China recently also bounced back, and then US really gained momentum. I always look at two data points in the US as an example. I look at like, how were diagnostic procedures performing in the US and then how are surgical procedures performing. And probably at our trough when Omicron was hitting in the US in January, we had about flat diagnostic procedures, and we were looking at surgical procedures down near double digit, down 10%. Encouragingly, as we exited March, we started to see diagnostic procedures tick up to high single digit and start to see a flattening of surgical procedures. I expect in the month of April in the US to see it go north of 2019 levels, really driven by cardio cardiac ablation, bariatrics and colorectal surgery. Well, thank you, Danielle. Appreciate the question and hope you are well. We -- in US, the ASCs, I think, are -- it's still relatively low penetration, I would tell, from a macro US, less than 20%, but I think it's the fastest growing as we know. In a COVID environment, we've seen the model evolve to create a safe, more patient-friendly experience that addresses a patient sentiment of not wanting to go into a hospital setting. Certain procedures have gone there early sooner than later. I'd say hips or migraine and knees, less spine per se, less complicated. Obviously, trauma case is still happening in the hospital setting. We've done a lot of work recently to modify our business model to make it a capital-efficient flow, if you will, in inventory management, on the personalization of care using digital assets to kind of your pre-op and your post-op experience less full of friction. And we're taking a lot of experience in the US ASCs to really what we're doing in China in the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 cities as well as we deliver care. So I'm optimistic that this channel will continue to evolve. I do think that we think we start competitiveness there, and we're making sure that we really have a sustainable business model going forward. Thank you."

I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for Johnson & Johnson in becoming a two sector company focused on innovative medicine at MedTech, we strengthened our position as an innovation powerhouse. We breakthrough science and transformative technology, we innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can. And as we share at our Enterprise Business Review, we have a stronger growth margin profile and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results. I'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with innovative medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5% at MedTech adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%. For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth. These results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond. So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine. For the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products. Our multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example with significant contribution from recently launched products including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Turning to clinical trials. Key results from the year included positive Phase III readout for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI, in one to three prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. DARZALEX in front-line multi myeloma transplant eligible patients. RYBREVANT, in combination with chemotherapy and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer. And finally TREMFYA monotherapy in Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, we saw positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 readout for nipocalimab and TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we initiated our Phase 3 clinical development programs for Milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. Beyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast track designations for Milvexian in Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Acute Coronary Syndrome. And with 19 U.S. and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. Our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our oncology pipeline. Now moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first-time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales, as we continue to build a best-in-class business. We are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation and moving into higher growth markets, as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, which focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. And at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our Ottava surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy and continued market expansion for VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023. In electrophysiology, we have a lot of momentum in our post-field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU. The true pulse generator has received approval in the EU and we received first and only approval from the U.S. FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation. And in the fourth quarter, findings from our QDOT MICRO Catheter Q-FFICIENCY Study showed that very high power, short duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced health care utilization for atrial fibrillation patients. In Vision, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity versus the competition. Turning to Abiomed. We recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed RECOVER IV randomized, controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our Enterprise Business Review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy (ph) stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy, guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjogren's Disease and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we see strong progress towards these goals. In electrophysiology that includes the full U.S. market release of QDOT MICRO Catheter and we are expecting CE Mark approval for our post-field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in the first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of 2024. And in Abiomed, we expect U.S. commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with smart assist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming. Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do help our patients. We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess.\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Joaquin. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted reflects the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales increased 7.2%, with 11% in the U.S. and 2.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.7% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 2.1% outside the U.S. It is important to note that sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,500 basis points operationally. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.70 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.22 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and the diluted earnings per share was $2.29, representing increases of 2.4% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.2%. For the full year 2023, sales were $85.2 billion. Sales grew 7.4%, with 10.6% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 8.2% in the U.S. and 3.4% outside the U.S. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,000 basis points operationally. Net earnings for the full year 2023 were $13.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $6.14 a year ago. Full year 2023 adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.92, representing increases of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, versus full year 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 10.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.7 billion increased 4% with growth of 9.5% in the U.S. and a decline of 3.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide and U.S. sales growth was 9.5%, and growth outside of the U.S. was 9.4%. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine were negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 22.2% and 19%, respectively. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in both STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively. This growth was driven by market growth and share gains as well as favorable patient mix in TREMFYA. Growth of 17.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in other Oncology. As a reminder, we expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures and a loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA, REMICADE and PREZISTA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.7 billion increased 13.4% with Abiomed contributing 4.5% to growth. Growth in the U.S. was 14.1% and 12.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.1%. MedTech was negatively impacted by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 50 basis points, primarily in Advanced Surgery and Vision. Electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.2% with strong growth in all regions, including Europe. This growth was driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OCTARAY catheters. Abiomed contributed $340 million in sales within the quarter driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology. Growth of 6.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by volume based procurement in China, primarily in Endocutters. Orthopaedics growth of 5% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, as well as lapping of prior year China\u2019s VBP price concessions in Spine. Growth of 6.6% in Vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS EYHANCE, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by U.S. stocking dynamics. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 140 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin deleveraged by 130 basis points due to commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix in MedTech, partially offset by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit cost in Innovative Medicine. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $4.5 billion or 20.9% of sales this quarter. We invested $3.4 billion or 24.5% of sales in Innovative Medicine with the increase in investment being driven by higher milestones, partially offset by portfolio prioritization. In MedTech, R&D investment was $1.1 billion or 14.6% of sales with the increase in investment primarily driven by the Laminar acquisition. Interest income was $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $77 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances and a lower average debt balance. The other income and expense line was income of $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized gains on securities and lower (ph) COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% versus 16% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net decrease of tax liabilities, including the settlement of the 2013 through 2016 U.S. tax audit. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.8% versus 16.2% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2023 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 32.5% to 29.2%. Innovative Medicine margins declined from 37.7% to 37.4%, primarily driven by higher R&D milestones, partially offset by favorable patient mix and leveraging and selling and marketing expense. MedTech margins declined from 24.5% to 15.5% primarily driven by in-process research and development expense from the Laminar acquisition, commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by selling and marketing expense leverage. This concludes the sale and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\nJoseph Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson evidenced by notable top and bottom line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024. Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023. So now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023. For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward. As far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed over $3 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines. Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022 and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year. Through the Kenvue separation, we further reduced the Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders. Now turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December by filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6% or $88.2 billion to $89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. In Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY and SPRAVATO. In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers: first, advancing our differentiated pipeline such as programs in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets; second, expanding our reach and scale around the world; and third, building operational resilience across our portfolio. We don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.09 as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year. Turning to other items on our P&L. We expect our 2024 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization. We expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrants in Europe in the second half of this year and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L. This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now we do acknowledge that this 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets. Regarding other income and expense, we anticipate income to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest income between $450 million and $550 million, consistent with 2023 levels. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing U.S. incentives for innovation and resulting in U.S. based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Our full year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to $10.75. Based on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. We project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved. We anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024 with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Spine and Trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024. Regarding EPS phasing, it is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023 and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023. So based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near and long-term financial targets. I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world. It is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. With my one question, I'm curious why you're looking for 2024 procedure volumes to remain above pre-COVID levels and your expectations for how long that will last? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is -- were all-time high in our company history with operational -- adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in heart (ph) recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics and in Vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year, but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter. Now, certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally and while we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing and the like, there is a bolus of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. And we see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024 and therefore, being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that. But overall, we see the amended procedures continuing into at least the first half of 2024. Now we also have a number of tailwinds on our side other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024. We have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We file already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP. In orthopedics, we continue to move into higher growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the [indiscernible], in Energy and ECHELON 3000 as a stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures too. In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you in electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters. We obtained approval for our VARIPULSE, loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT MICRO, our newest radio frequency ablation catheter. So overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our Enterprise Business Review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two-part for me on CARVYKTI. I noticed an ODAC panel was just announced to review the CARTITUDE-4 data. I was just wondering if you can talk about the focus of that upcoming meeting and your confidence in an on-time label expansion for CARTITUDE-4? And then the second part of the question is I know in manufacturing, you've been ramping up in Belgium, and I believe that facility is now up and running. So how should we think about supply for 2024 broadly for CARVYKTI? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Terence. So with more than 2,000 patients treated CARVYKTI, it's already the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall and we are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. And overall, we remain confident in two things, both the risk benefit of CARVYKTI in the indication that is being studied and at the same on the potential of CARVYKTI to be $5 billion plus asset at peak year sales. Regarding the ODAC that you commented, we are very confident on the data of our Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study that as a reminder, support the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines in treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know. And we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. And we very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future. We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI. And we continue to have the focus on bringing this in immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in earlier lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication in April 5, and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in the first quarter of 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI. Regarding your manufacturing question, we've done a significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continuous growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility. Since 2023. We are making progress to your point, Terence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. And we also have contracted additional capacity, external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward that will start mid this year. On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland side. And at the same time, we continue to progress with new U.S. capacity and additions site in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus. Late December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20-liter tanks to 50-liter tanks of lentivirus production in our U.S. facility. So overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024. And we are working towards building this $5 billion plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, as we have discussed in the past, moving from treating to progression to treating to cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats to -- a nice finish to the year here. Joe or Joaquin, I'd love to hear just a general update on your M&A appetite and expand on your recent comments about Abiomed being a gateway in cardiovascular devices, which you, Joaquin, commented on earlier this month? Thanks so much for taking the question.\nJoseph Wolk: Yeah. So Larry, let me start, good morning, and then I can turn it over to Joaquin. So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they are a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights, a familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms. We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago, we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed. We're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the Street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition. So it's been a really nice fit. What I would say is, we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those may have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that when you think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI for one, it's been -- that's kind of our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. And look, talking about that, Larry, let me say, we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. And as Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how, and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class. To illustrate that, the two deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx would be in that direction. So for example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy like prostate cancer with a number of products marketed already. And this could be a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic cut-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed under gene therapy. So very much so and in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicine in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of Vision. So overall, that\u2019s our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific and to Joe\u2019s point, scientific lens in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just, Joe a question for you. How should we think about gross margins in 2024 and beyond? I know you talked about operating margins, but it did seem like adjusted gross margins came down in 4Q. And I'm just wondering, if that's a one-off result or a longer-term trend when you think about -- as we think about kind of the cadence of your P&L over the next few years? Thank you.\nJoseph Wolk: Yeah. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as you look at that specifically for the fourth quarter, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech, specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say two-thirds of that is represented by the Laminar transaction. You also then have, I would say, in the fourth quarter specific some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters. And then you have the inflationary impact, obviously, with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L, that is occurring throughout 2023. And we expect it to occur throughout at least the first half of 2024. We're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say water level, if you will, that should be going forward, but not hurting the P&L as we look out beyond the second half of 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you so much. I was just wondering, if we could get your latest thoughts on the potential impact of Novo's osteoarthritis data on orthopedic utilization, given the focus on WOMAC or pain scores. I believe the presentation could be here soon. Just curious to hear your thoughts and also what kind of scores could or may not have a potential impact? Thank you for taking the question.\nJoaquin Duato: So overall, look, osteoarthritis is a contributor to knee surgery. Sometimes I'm asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID. And we don't see any change in that neither in the hips or in the knee area or in any of the segments that we compete. So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory. Specifically we are optimistic about how we are progressing with our VELYS robotic system for total knee replacement. We have already have 30,000 procedures with very positive feedback from the surgeons, especially in the ambulatory surgical centers. We are working to submit our 510(k) for our VELYS unique knee application. And we are seeing a strong recovery also in our hip business with a combination of new products like ACTIS, KINCISE and VELYS hip navigation. So we feel good about our orthopedics business as we continue to see global procedure recovery in most markets. We continue to succeed with our new products, and we love also part of the headwind that we had in China during this year. So very positive outlook moving forward for our orthopedics business.\nJoseph Wolk: And Shagun, it's also important to maybe provide us a reminder what we commented to last quarter, and that's -- we're looking very hard at improving the profitability of the orthopedics unit, so being very selective as to what geographies we play in and what SKUs are actually going to be offered. So not only will you see some of the strength in the top line, as Joaquin outlined, but you should see an improved margin profile for that business as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.. So just maybe an area we don't spend as much time on is on the respiratory side, specifically, PAH. But just sort of a two-part question, but that franchise of yours continue to sort of outperform expectations. So curious, if you can talk about sort of what's driving success there? There's also an area where you don't have a lot of sort of longer-term investment. So going back to sort of the business development question, I'm just curious in your interest in sort of PAH or respiratory more generally as an area, further focus given your key franchises are going to be going away, but you do have the infrastructure there already?\nJoaquin Duato: So first, let me underline the great results of our PAH franchise in 2023. We had growth in the high-teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024. We are working towards the combination of macitentan, OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark will be OPSYNVI. And that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance. And in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise. Are we looking at other areas there? There, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. And we continue to look to see how we can continue to extend the success of our pulmonary franchise into the future. But overall, we're very happy with the trajectory of our pulmonary franchise in 2023. And we expect a similar trajectory as macitentan, OPSUMIT and Tadalafil (ph) become standard of care clearly established in this area.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. I just wanted to ask you with respect to your oncology franchise. Do you have any thoughts on CAR-Ts for autoimmune disease at all? And then secondly, radiopharmaceutical?\nJoaquin Duato: So thank you, Louise and we have a strong oncology franchise in different areas. I commented that here in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now and antibody drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. We have Phase 3 studies completed. We expect -- we have filed all the three indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024. So we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in first line. Moving into bladder cancer. You also will see data with TARIS-200, and TARIS-210 in non-muscle invasive localized bladder cancer. And we received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. And then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise. We talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well [Technical Difficulty] with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first-line in newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases to your question, yes, but it's early data. As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner two CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising. We are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotics for a radio enhancer that this still been developing head and neck cancer. We expanded our rights at the end of the year. And this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancing, and we\u2019ll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology. And it remains a core strength of our Innovative Medicine group.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about MedTech trends and margins. And I think you mentioned some of the headwinds there were patient mix. Would love to get an idea of maybe kind of in the middle of the P&L and the operating line in terms of margin progression throughout the year, which ones of those of your business lines being kind of more reflecting that negative mix that you described and how that progresses during the year? Thanks.\nJoseph Wolk: Yeah, Matt. I apologize, but it was a little bit tough to hear your question entirely. I think it was around margins, specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024. That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business. I highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics. But we're quite frankly doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin, and we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just wanted to ask you about the XARELTO patient mix that you guys called out. Just help us with kind of current dynamics and maybe looking forward whether this trend you expect to continue? Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Yeah, Geoff. I can answer that one. So specifically on XARELTO in the quarter, we would say there's two items. It's patient mix, but there is also a one-time entry. Moving forward in 2024, we do expect that there will be a decline but not to the extent that you saw in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Joe, sorry to harp on the MedTech margin side of things. I appreciate everything you're saying for going forward. But just as we look at Q4 specifically, even adding back Laminar, we're still getting to sort of down 400 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And I was just hoping maybe you could bridge us a little bit more. Is there any component of that is sort of price increases taken in late '22 into '23 rolling off or anything that you would highlight there? Thanks so much.\nJoseph Wolk: No, Danielle. I think it's really the inflationary impact, so out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, 5 points are really Laminar. The other -- the balance of 4 points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier and then the mix component, whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call. Again, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there\u2019s nothing that happened \u2013 maybe this is the best way to state it. There\u2019s nothing that happened in Q4 that has us concerned about our outlook or calls around margin profile or EPS for the balance of this upcoming year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much and thanks for all of the details today. So notwithstanding the recently announced Ambrx acquisition, in recent years, J&J has executed more MedTech M&A than pharma M&A. And I don't mean to belabor the point, I know that you got some specific therapeutic area questions. But could you just comment at a high level on what has held J&J back in pharma M&A in recent years and whether we should expect greater cash deployment to accelerate long-term pharma revenue growth going forward? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: So thank you, David. And M&A has been -- M&A and external innovation has been a core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof of concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like client senses or partnerships. Just last year, we completed overall at Johnson & Johnson more than 50 deals. The thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio. And our bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities and our commercial reach. So hence, why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage. Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CNBG now called AbelZeta (ph) in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-T in this area that could launch in this decade or at the end of the year, we also did another deal in antibody drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem, which was underreported. But we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing and in commercial. And that\u2019s been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, David. We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: All right. Good morning. Thanks you. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on your electrophysiology comments. You had an extraordinary quarter. I'm guessing the new products helped. Maybe you could give us a little more color on maybe quantify the impact -- the negative impact from China VBP? And looking ahead, we've got not -- we've got one PFA device approved in U.S., another one seemingly coming in the next month or three maybe. How should we think about the EP franchise as we look ahead to '24? What are you incorporating in your thinking? Thank you so much.\nJoaquin Duato: So thank you for the question. Great, and strong results of our EP franchise in 2023. And you should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, a strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at the -- to your point that the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean it was in Asia-Pacific, in the U.S. and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery, but also by new product performance and some offset also, a slight offset of value-based procurement in China. The new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters OCTARAY and OPTRELL. And also, importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radio frequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter. And that together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board has driven this result in electrophysiology that in the fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the U.S. and 29% outside of the U.S. So very strong results. So we have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. And when it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow. For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system. And the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable deletion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedures. So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radio frequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's is going to be from day 1 fully integrated in our mapping system. We have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologist. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan. We are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have five clinical trials active, three of them have completed. And we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the U.S. FDA in 2024. Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay. That's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you plus the option of having a catheter like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of deletion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future. And it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world. So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area. I'm positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward. As we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation, it's an area that is still undertreated. And the outcomes of radio frequency ablation and most likely, the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy. So very positive about the outlook of our -- and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess. The strong performance we delivered in \u201823 gives me great confidence in the trajectory of our business. As I said earlier, we are entering 2024 from a position of strength, and we have multiple catalysts for growth. No other company is as well positioned as Johnson & Johnson to lead the next wave of health care innovation. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the year ahead. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joseph Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson evidenced by notable top and bottom line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024. Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023. So now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023. For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward. As far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed over $3 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines. Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022 and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year. Through the Kenvue separation, we further reduced the Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders. Now turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December by filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6% or $88.2 billion to $89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. In Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY and SPRAVATO. In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers: first, advancing our differentiated pipeline such as programs in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets; second, expanding our reach and scale around the world; and third, building operational resilience across our portfolio. We don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.09 as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year. Turning to other items on our P&L. We expect our 2024 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization. We expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrants in Europe in the second half of this year and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L. This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now we do acknowledge that this 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets. Regarding other income and expense, we anticipate income to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest income between $450 million and $550 million, consistent with 2023 levels. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing U.S. incentives for innovation and resulting in U.S. based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Our full year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to $10.75. Based on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. We project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved. We anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024 with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Spine and Trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024. Regarding EPS phasing, it is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023 and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023. So based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near and long-term financial targets. I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world. It is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Yeah. So Larry, let me start, good morning, and then I can turn it over to Joaquin. So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they are a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights, a familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms. We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago, we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed. We're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the Street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition. So it's been a really nice fit. What I would say is, we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those may have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that when you think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI for one, it's been -- that's kind of our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term. Yeah. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as you look at that specifically for the fourth quarter, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech, specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say two-thirds of that is represented by the Laminar transaction. You also then have, I would say, in the fourth quarter specific some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters. And then you have the inflationary impact, obviously, with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L, that is occurring throughout 2023. And we expect it to occur throughout at least the first half of 2024. We're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say water level, if you will, that should be going forward, but not hurting the P&L as we look out beyond the second half of 2024. And Shagun, it's also important to maybe provide us a reminder what we commented to last quarter, and that's -- we're looking very hard at improving the profitability of the orthopedics unit, so being very selective as to what geographies we play in and what SKUs are actually going to be offered. So not only will you see some of the strength in the top line, as Joaquin outlined, but you should see an improved margin profile for that business as well. Yeah, Matt. I apologize, but it was a little bit tough to hear your question entirely. I think it was around margins, specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024. That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business. I highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics. But we're quite frankly doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin, and we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set. No, Danielle. I think it's really the inflationary impact, so out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, 5 points are really Laminar. The other -- the balance of 4 points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier and then the mix component, whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call. Again, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there's nothing that happened \u2013 maybe this is the best way to state it. There's nothing that happened in Q4 that has us concerned about our outlook or calls around margin profile or EPS for the balance of this upcoming year."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thank you, Jess and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for Johnson & Johnson in becoming a two sector company focused on innovative medicine at MedTech, we strengthened our position as an innovation powerhouse. We breakthrough science and transformative technology, we innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can. And as we share at our Enterprise Business Review, we have a stronger growth margin profile and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results. I'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with innovative medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5% at MedTech adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%. For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth. These results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond. So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine. For the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products. Our multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example with significant contribution from recently launched products including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Turning to clinical trials. Key results from the year included positive Phase III readout for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI, in one to three prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. DARZALEX in front-line multi myeloma transplant eligible patients. RYBREVANT, in combination with chemotherapy and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer. And finally TREMFYA monotherapy in Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, we saw positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 readout for nipocalimab and TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we initiated our Phase 3 clinical development programs for Milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. Beyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast track designations for Milvexian in Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Acute Coronary Syndrome. And with 19 U.S. and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. Our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our oncology pipeline. Now moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first-time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales, as we continue to build a best-in-class business. We are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation and moving into higher growth markets, as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, which focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. And at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our Ottava surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy and continued market expansion for VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023. In electrophysiology, we have a lot of momentum in our post-field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU. The true pulse generator has received approval in the EU and we received first and only approval from the U.S. FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation. And in the fourth quarter, findings from our QDOT MICRO Catheter Q-FFICIENCY Study showed that very high power, short duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced health care utilization for atrial fibrillation patients. In Vision, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity versus the competition. Turning to Abiomed. We recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed RECOVER IV randomized, controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our Enterprise Business Review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy (ph) stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy, guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjogren's Disease and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we see strong progress towards these goals. In electrophysiology that includes the full U.S. market release of QDOT MICRO Catheter and we are expecting CE Mark approval for our post-field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in the first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of 2024. And in Abiomed, we expect U.S. commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with smart assist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming. Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do help our patients. We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess. Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is -- were all-time high in our company history with operational -- adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in heart (ph) recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics and in Vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year, but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter. Now, certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally and while we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing and the like, there is a bolus of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. And we see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024 and therefore, being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that. But overall, we see the amended procedures continuing into at least the first half of 2024. Now we also have a number of tailwinds on our side other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024. We have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We file already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP. In orthopedics, we continue to move into higher growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the [indiscernible], in Energy and ECHELON 3000 as a stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures too. In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you in electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters. We obtained approval for our VARIPULSE, loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT MICRO, our newest radio frequency ablation catheter. So overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our Enterprise Business Review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech. Thank you, Terence. So with more than 2,000 patients treated CARVYKTI, it's already the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall and we are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. And overall, we remain confident in two things, both the risk benefit of CARVYKTI in the indication that is being studied and at the same on the potential of CARVYKTI to be $5 billion plus asset at peak year sales. Regarding the ODAC that you commented, we are very confident on the data of our Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study that as a reminder, support the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines in treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know. And we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. And we very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future. We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI. And we continue to have the focus on bringing this in immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in earlier lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication in April 5, and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in the first quarter of 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI. Regarding your manufacturing question, we've done a significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continuous growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility. Since 2023. We are making progress to your point, Terence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. And we also have contracted additional capacity, external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward that will start mid this year. On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland side. And at the same time, we continue to progress with new U.S. capacity and additions site in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus. Late December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20-liter tanks to 50-liter tanks of lentivirus production in our U.S. facility. So overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024. And we are working towards building this $5 billion plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, as we have discussed in the past, moving from treating to progression to treating to cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Thank you. And look, talking about that, Larry, let me say, we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. And as Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how, and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class. To illustrate that, the two deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx would be in that direction. So for example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy like prostate cancer with a number of products marketed already. And this could be a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic cut-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed under gene therapy. So very much so and in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicine in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of Vision. So overall, that's our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific and to Joe's point, scientific lens in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders. So overall, look, osteoarthritis is a contributor to knee surgery. Sometimes I'm asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID. And we don't see any change in that neither in the hips or in the knee area or in any of the segments that we compete. So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory. Specifically we are optimistic about how we are progressing with our VELYS robotic system for total knee replacement. We have already have 30,000 procedures with very positive feedback from the surgeons, especially in the ambulatory surgical centers. We are working to submit our 510(k) for our VELYS unique knee application. And we are seeing a strong recovery also in our hip business with a combination of new products like ACTIS, KINCISE and VELYS hip navigation. So we feel good about our orthopedics business as we continue to see global procedure recovery in most markets. We continue to succeed with our new products, and we love also part of the headwind that we had in China during this year. So very positive outlook moving forward for our orthopedics business. So first, let me underline the great results of our PAH franchise in 2023. We had growth in the high-teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024. We are working towards the combination of macitentan, OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark will be OPSYNVI. And that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance. And in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise. Are we looking at other areas there? There, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. And we continue to look to see how we can continue to extend the success of our pulmonary franchise into the future. But overall, we're very happy with the trajectory of our pulmonary franchise in 2023. And we expect a similar trajectory as macitentan, OPSUMIT and Tadalafil (ph) become standard of care clearly established in this area. So thank you, Louise and we have a strong oncology franchise in different areas. I commented that here in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now and antibody drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. We have Phase 3 studies completed. We expect -- we have filed all the three indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024. So we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in first line. Moving into bladder cancer. You also will see data with TARIS-200, and TARIS-210 in non-muscle invasive localized bladder cancer. And we received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. And then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise. We talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well [Technical Difficulty] with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first-line in newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases to your question, yes, but it's early data. As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner two CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising. We are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotics for a radio enhancer that this still been developing head and neck cancer. We expanded our rights at the end of the year. And this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancing, and we'll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology. And it remains a core strength of our Innovative Medicine group. So thank you, David. And M&A has been -- M&A and external innovation has been a core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof of concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like client senses or partnerships. Just last year, we completed overall at Johnson & Johnson more than 50 deals. The thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio. And our bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities and our commercial reach. So hence, why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage. Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CNBG now called AbelZeta (ph) in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-T in this area that could launch in this decade or at the end of the year, we also did another deal in antibody drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem, which was underreported. But we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing and in commercial. And that's been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process. So thank you for the question. Great, and strong results of our EP franchise in 2023. And you should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, a strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at the -- to your point that the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean it was in Asia-Pacific, in the U.S. and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery, but also by new product performance and some offset also, a slight offset of value-based procurement in China. The new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters OCTARAY and OPTRELL. And also, importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radio frequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter. And that together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board has driven this result in electrophysiology that in the fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the U.S. and 29% outside of the U.S. So very strong results. So we have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. And when it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow. For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system. And the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable deletion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedures. So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radio frequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's is going to be from day 1 fully integrated in our mapping system. We have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologist. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan. We are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have five clinical trials active, three of them have completed. And we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the U.S. FDA in 2024. Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay. That's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you plus the option of having a catheter like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of deletion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future. And it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world. So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area. I'm positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward. As we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation, it's an area that is still undertreated. And the outcomes of radio frequency ablation and most likely, the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy. So very positive about the outlook of our -- and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business. Thank you, Jess. The strong performance we delivered in \u201823 gives me great confidence in the trajectory of our business. As I said earlier, we are entering 2024 from a position of strength, and we have multiple catalysts for growth. No other company is as well positioned as Johnson & Johnson to lead the next wave of health care innovation. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the year ahead. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJessica Moore: Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 third quarter business results and full-year financial outlook. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will start by reviewing the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato, our chairman and CEO; John Reed, and Ahmet Tezel, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech R&D leaders, as well as Erik Haas, our VP of Litigation, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. As a reminder, on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced the final results of the exchange offer and completion of the separation of Kenvue Inc. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Additionally, going forward, the pharmaceutical segment will be referred to as innovative medicine. Starting with Q3 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8% versus the third quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 6.4% as currency had a positive impact of 0.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 11.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 0.7% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 0.9 points. It is important to note that operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.9% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S., and 0.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.69 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.62 a year ago. Excluding after-tax and tangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing increases of 14.1% and 19.3% respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.9%. I will now comment on business sales performance. Unless otherwise stated percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2022 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with innovative medicine. Worldwide innovative medicine sales of $13.9 billion, increased 5.1% with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 4.3% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.2%, with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and growth of 4.3% outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from a recently launched products with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 20.7% and 27% respectively, due to continued share gains and market growth. Within immunology, we saw growth in STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 15.8% and 21.5% respectively. This growth was predominantly driven by favorable patient mix and market growth. Turning to newly launched products, we continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth and other oncology. We expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total innovative medicine sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA and REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales, due to competitive pressures. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased 10% with growth of 11.6% in the U.S., and 8.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 10.4% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4 points. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth, excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6%. On a pro forma basis, utilizing sales in the prior year from Abiomed as a standalone company, MedTech's growth for the quarter would be 6.4%. MedTech was negatively impacted across all platforms by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 60 basis points in volume-based procurement in China, primarily in five MedTech platforms: Spine, Trauma, Endocutters, Energy, and Electrophysiology. As communicated last quarter, we saw the return to more normalized seasonality with moderate deceleration in the third quarter. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 48.1%, which includes $311 million related to Abiomed. This reflects growth in Abiomed patient procedures in the high-teens and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology in surgery. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to this growth with a double-digit increase of 20.3%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OPTRELL Mapping Catheters. Operational growth of 3.2% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 5.4% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve. Global vision growth was negatively impacted by 100 basis points, due to the Blink divestiture. Orthopedics operational growth of 2.6% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products, such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions, and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China in Spine and Trauma. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin was flat due to favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit costs in the innovative medicine business, partially offset by commodity inflation, unfavorable product mix, and restructuring related to excess inventory costs in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 40 basis points, driven by increased expenses across the enterprise. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 16.2% of sales this quarter. R&D was leveraged by 120 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments in the innovative medicine business. Additionally, IPR&D impairments were $206 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income was $182 million in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $499 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $226 million in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on public securities partially offset by the lower COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs and lower litigation expense. Restructuring in the third quarter was $158 million, primarily related to the innovative medicine restructuring program announced in the first quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.4% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a non-deductible, non-recurring pre-tax charge that occurred in the current quarter. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. As a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson is presenting the consumer health business financial results as discontinuing operations, including a gain of approximately $21 billion. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax and separation-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35.3% to 37.6%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and innovative medicine, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and commodity inflation in MedTech. Innovative medicine margins improved from 41.4% to 45.4%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and R&D portfolio prioritization. MedTech margins declined from 25% to 24.7%, primarily driven by commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix partially offset by a divestiture gain. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson & Johnson with a sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech. What has remained consistent is our Credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137-year legacy of tackling the world's most complex healthcare challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world. As we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of healthcare. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future. Before we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business. The first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation, which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted timeframe and under budget, while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders. Through the separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue Debt Offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. We maintained our current quarterly dividend per share and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility. We will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024. Another item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to believe the IRA's price setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients. As we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by of us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS' drug price setting scheme to continue supporting patients' access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer. Moving to segment highlights in the quarter, as Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter, while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth. Within the innovative medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. And U.S. FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class, bi-specific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Regarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late breaking abstracts, including three featured in the Presidential Symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three Phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including MARIPOSA, MARIPOSA II, and PAPILLON. Additionally, updated data from the Sunrise 1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer will be shared, as well as the first ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGFR mutations. We also look forward to presenting Phase II data for Nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in November, and have already launched a Phase II combination study NRA. Lastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. This includes the initiation of the ANTHEM Phase 2B study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month, and the Phase III clinical program titled Iconic for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expected to begin in November. Moving to MedTech, notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform. We received FDA clearance from multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson & Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy-related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures. It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams. In pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE mark for our VARIPULSE Catheter. We expect the completion for our U.S. VARIPULSE study to occur in the fourth quarter. We are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STSF dual energy catheter, capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device, and Omnipulse, a large tip focal catheter. Beyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the Abiomed Impella ECP clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high-risk PCI procedures. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small bore access and closure techniques. While not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our orthopedic business. As part of this two-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. We anticipate some short-term modest revenue disruption in orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability. The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the $5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute a strategic and disciplined approach utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth, and executing share repurchases when appropriate. Moving onto our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first nine months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full-year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%, or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%. Just a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue. While we do not speculate on future currency movements utilizing the euro spot rate as of last week at 1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million resulting in a full-year impact of negative 1% or $800 million. Looking across the P&L, adjusted pre-tax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained, ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Due to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million. And finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 to $10.08 or 12.5% growth at the midpoint, and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13 or 13% growth at the midpoint. Since January, We've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and $0.25 on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing $0.10 for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023. Now I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024, and our teams are actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider. For innovative medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all while advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings, and approvals ahead of us. This includes data presentations and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our Phase III study of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis, and readouts from two Phase III or ELITA trials in early-stage prostate cancer. We do not expect the entry of STELARA Biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid-2024 in Europe. For MedTech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all MedTech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness, while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, Abiomed, and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels. With respect to tax, as you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's Pillar 2 Directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD Pillar 2 framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1st, 2024. As a result, we currently estimate it up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024. In addition, the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of U.S. incentives for innovation and will result in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Regarding share count given the Kenvue separation, the full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson & Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate $0.15 negative currency impact on 2024 full-year adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our strong performance during the first nine months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our innovative medicine and MedTech pipelines, and the long-term strategy of Johnson & Johnson at our upcoming Enterprise Business Review on December 5th at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule, will be shared shortly. We hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the available webcast. I want to conclude my remarks by thanking our teams around the world for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to excellence on behalf of our patients. We are confident that our strategy will position us to deliver long-term growth and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, it's my pleasure to turn to Kevin and begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live.\nDavid Risinger: Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the strong financial performance. So my question is on benchmarking MARIPOSA results, please. Could you share your thoughts on key considerations, including AstraZeneca's recent FLAURA2 results, which included a nine-month PFS benefit? Thanks very much.\nJohn Reed: Hi. John, Reed here. It's great to join the call. This is my first time as a newcomer to J&J, and before I answer your question, David, I would just like to say I have to tell you I'm really enjoying being a new member of the J&J team. I've really been impressed with the culture inspired by our Credo with the caliber of our talent our people here at J&J and with the really strong performance of the pipeline. We've already launched two NMEs this year, Akeega for prostate cancer and TALVEY for myeloma, continuing our tradition in bringing new therapies in those agents, and we're positioned to deliver an average of more than two enemies per year between now and the close of the decade 2030. So the pipeline is very robust and it's exciting to be here and to be a part of it. So on to your question, the data will be presented at ESMO in a Presidential session. So we're embargoed until then. Abstracts will be available on [Wednesday] (ph). I can only say that the RYBREVANT Lazertinib combo did perform well head-to-head against Osimertinib. Our regimen is a chemo-free option for patients, which we think is important, and we'll present those data at ESMO.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So I think most folks may look at the orthopedic results in medical devices as maybe being a little bit softer-than-expected. And I know that's not everything by a long shot for J&J, but given the expectations for continued strength heading, I think, into Q3, if you could talk maybe a little bit about your comment on more traditional seasonality and thoughts on the sustainability of that strength, as well as the sort of divestiture and sort of realignment plan, Joe, that you described. Thanks.\nJoaquin Duato: So thank you for the question. And yes, I mean, our results in orthopedics were 2.6% growth overall. And part of it, as you mentioned is driven by seasonality. As we have commented, we are in a journey of improvement in orthopedics. We want to be number one and number two in every segment we compete. And that is a place where we are not there yet, but we are very confident that we are going to continue to make improvements by investing and by growing in the highest growth segments. We have made improvements in our portfolio, for example, on the knee side. We have a more complete portfolio now on the revision side, on the cementless side. We are launching now our VELYS orthopedics total robot, total knee surgery replacement in Europe. And we already have about 30,000 procedures that have been performed with our VELYS robotic system. Overall, we are increasing our penetration also in the ASCs, which is a fast-growing segment, and we see our performance continue to improve in the U.S. and globally. In this particular quarter, we also had some impact due to the impact of value-based procurement in China and also because of the impact of the Russia sanctions that was mentioned already in the previous remarks. So overall, in orthopedics, we are determined to continue our journey of improvement. We are focusing in having the right portfolio. We have a very strong team in the field, and as Joe has announced, and Joe can comment on that, we have a plan to be able to continue to improve our margins in orthopedics.\nJoe Wolk: Yes, just very quickly, Matt, thanks for the question. With respect to the restructuring program that we announced specifically in orthopedics, we're looking to exit those less profitable markets and product lines. So we'll have some clearly inventory write-downs as a result of that. Over the next two years, there will be some modest revenue disruption, but we actually do think these actions not only accelerate growth going forward, but will improve profitability.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Shibutani: Great. Thank you very much. Can you provide us with some insight into updates on the TALC litigation process? And then secondly, if you could just comment, Joe, you used the word voracious last time with your appetite for business development opportunities. How does that word stand still in terms of your appetite on the floor? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Hey, so Eric, why don't I turn it over to you to discuss the TALC litigation matter and then I'll come back and answer Chris's second question.\nErik Haas: Great. Thanks, Joe. The short answer is that we continue to pursue the four-pronged strategy that we communicated back in July. So let me quickly summarize those four prongs and highlight the salient developments and perhaps anticipate some follow-up questions about TALC. So the first prong, we are pursuing the appeal through to the Supreme Court of the United States of the July ruling by the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court that dismissed LTL's bankruptcy case. Notably, our appeal recently was joined by counsel representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants. Also, thereafter, the bankruptcy court certified the case for a direct appeal to the third circuit, bypassing the district court, because the bankruptcy court found that the appeal raises matters of significant public interest, the resolution of which would material advance the progress of the case and we fully agree with that assessment. The appeal challenges both the validity, as well as the application of the novel standard that was imposed by the third circuit that requires a showing of, \u201cimmediate financial distress\u201d to proceed with the bankruptcy case. That immediate financial distress requirement, which the third circuit did not specifically define, is nowhere in the bankruptcy code and is contrary to the standards that are implied -- employed by other circuits. Moreover, under any reasonable interpretation of that standard, we believe the record has fully established that LTL faced immediate financial distress due to the large volume of TALC claims that were asserted against it. In terms of timing, the third circuit could rule at any moment whether it will take the direct appeal or not. If it does, we expect briefing to take place over the next couple of months with a decision in the early 2024 timeframe. And because we do anticipate the third circuit will primarily affirm the application of its standards, we will immediately thereafter request the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split and decide if the third circuit's novel approach is an appropriate standard for deciding a motion to dismiss. We do not think it is. We hope to squeeze the cert petition to the Supreme Court into the first term in 2024, but if not, we will raise it in the second term. Working with the council, representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants more than we had previously that were along with us. Along with the -- in addition to the future claims representatives and together with the council and the future claims representatives were pursuing a consensual resolution of the TALC claims through another bankruptcy. And that is exactly what the bankruptcy court, the New Jersey bankruptcy court urged and strongly recommended that we do in its decision that actually dismissed the case. And the New Jersey court made those recommendations having found that LTL had made remarkable progress towards an equitable and efficient resolution to-date. So we are continuing on in that process. In terms of timing on the second prong, the consensual resolution is on the same trajectory as the initial bankruptcy plan with a vote expected in the next six months to determine whether the requisite super majority of claimants support the plan. Third, while those negotiations are proceeding, we will continue to vigorously defend the meritless TALC claims in the tort system. As you may have seen just this last week, we had a significant favorable ruling in that regard with the New Jersey's appellate court in the Barden case reversing a $223 million verdict against the company. The appellate court reversed because it determined the opinions of the leading plaintiff's experts were unsound, were unscientific, and were unsubstantiated. And it is that baseless nature of those expert opinions why we have prevailed in the vast majority of the cases that have been tried to-date. In terms of timing of the litigation, there are two additional mesothelioma cases that we expect will be tried this year with more to come in 2024. As with the Barden case, it's important to keep in mind that the ultimate resolution of those matters often is determined at the appellate level, not at the trial level, which is the place which occurs in the forms that the plaintiff lawyers choose. Finally, we will aggressively challenge the abuses of the judicial system by the mass tort plaintiff's bar and its experts with their own affirmative litigation. We mentioned last time that we brought two actions against the plaintiff's bar's lead experts for defaming our TALC products with publications premised unknowingly false propositions. And those are moving forward. They've been fully briefed with respect to the initial case motions and in terms of timing, we expect a ruling shortly from the Federal District Court in New Jersey, whether those matters may proceed to the discovery phase. So that's a quick summary. I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have regarding the strategy.\nJoe Wolk: Great. Thank you, Eric. Chris, regarding your second question, you know, if J&J had a nickel for every time voracious was quoted back to me since the second quarter earnings, we probably could have taken up guidance even a little bit more. And while that's often associated with wanting or devouring great quantities, I think it's really the second definition in webster's where having a very eager approach to an activity is the construct in which I meant that term in the second quarter. So I could have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, my predecessors could have said that. We routinely, almost weekly meet on new opportunities that may complement our existing portfolio or our future pipeline in both MedTech and Innovative Medicines. And the current moment is no different. In fact, we're in a very good position, given the low levels of net debt, the cash we were able to raise to fulfill one of our capital allocation priorities, which you're probably very, very familiar with at this point in time. But we're not going to compromise our principles in making sure that it's a strategic fit. So it fits into the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities, or the global reach that will add value to that asset in our hands versus someone else. And we're going to make sure that we're disciplined in that approach financially by ensuring that we have a return that's commensal with the risk that we're bearing on behalf of shareholders. So we'd much rather have an okay deal pass us by, then make a bad deal. And that's kind of the principles that we'll live into. There's no deal that's too big, give it our credit rating, as well as our financial strength and annual cash flow generation. But as you know, we've had great success doing smaller, earlier-stage deals as well. We're agnostic with respect to whether it\u2019d be the next one being MedTech or Innovative Medicines, we are simply looking for the best qualified deal that meets both strategic and financial parameters. So hopefully that answers your question. Next question, Kevin?\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I'll stick with one. So on CARVYKTI, can you talk about the commercial backdrop, just with respect to new centers or prescribers and related on manufacturing? You guys have any update on the vector constraints and maybe when that could be relieved? Thank you so much.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Geoff. And as you have seen in the progression quarter-over-quarter of CARVYKTI, we continue to have on one hand strong demand and on the other hand, progress in our manufacturing. We're also very encouraged by the data that came out with CARTITUDE-4 that eventually we make CARVYKTI also a medicine in early absence of therapy. So when it comes to our manufacturing progress, I'm going to let John explain what are we doing in order to be able to supply the strong demand that we are seeing in CARVYKTI today. Overall, what you can expect, Geoff, is that we -- you will continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in 2023 into also 2024.\nJohn Reed: Yes, to follow up on Joaquin\u2019s comments, we've been progressively adding more and more capacity. That's included at our original launch site in New Jersey, but we're close to having an additional manufacturing site up and rolling in Europe, in Belgium, and also have recently increased our capacity by using some excess capacity that Novartis had to further bolster the number of slots that we can accommodate. One of the traditionally rate-limiting components of the therapy has been the lentivirus component, and there we've made really outstanding progress in-house, mastering that technology, increasing the scale at our factory in Switzerland. And we're in the process -- we're building, I think it will be available next year, another factory in the Netherlands to support the lentivirus component, which has sometimes been one of the rate limiting aspects. So altogether the capacity continues to ramp up and we continue to perfect the technology I would say. Same thing with the number of centers that are qualified to administer the therapy and we're also making progress on the number of countries where CARVYKTI will be available. So very excited, obviously, about the momentum with that. Really, that best-in-class CAR therapy, the CARTITUDE-4 data as you know, showed unprecedented progression-free survival benefit, a hazard ratio of 0.26, overall response rate of 99%, 86% complete response. Very durable for a one and done therapy that was well tolerated. The Grade 3 or above cytokine release syndrome was only 1.1%. So this is really, I think, now emerging as the preferred second line therapy. And we hope to do more such as bringing the front line as a possible alternative to stem cell transplant.\nJoaquin Duato: And, you know, Geoff, to your point, in multiple myeloma new product launches, we are also very encouraged by the launch of TECVAYLI and also the recent appointment of TALVEY. The progression of these medicines is exceeding our internal expectations and we already have about 2,000 healthcare professionals in the U.S. that are REM certified to be able to administer TECVAYLI and TALVEY. So very encouraging progress in these two medicines in multiple myeloma. And we expect to be able to break out TECVAYLI sales beginning in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to ask on STELARA and the biosimilar competition in the U.S. now expected in 2025. That's not new news, but I wanted to check in on how beneficial is the extra year for the innovative medicine and businesses defense strategy. I guess focusing on just the potential for TREMFYA to take share from STELARA and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease indications? And does this time make sure you provide more confidence and potential to hit the constant currency revenue target set for 2025 for the pharma unit? Thanks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you for the question. Certainly we have always been very confident in being able to hit our $57 billion target in 2025 for pharma. As I have explained before, there are a number of factors there, the first one and most important is the growth that we're having in our key assets, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, UPTRAVI, our long-acting injectables, and especially DARZALEX, we continues to have a tremendous trajectory gaining share in first line. We are encouraged, as I just commented, by the launches of CARVYKTI, the progression of SPRAVATO, and also the recent launches too, also in multiple myeloma of TECVAYLI and TALVEY. And looking into 2024, the remainder of the year, and also into 2025, we have some very exciting news in our pipeline. Some of them have been already commented. For example, the first chemo-free regimen as first line in EGFR mutated non-small lung cancer. We will be presenting the data of MARIPOSA in our ESMO and that potentially will be a filing and an approval in 2025. This would be a new standard of therapy in this line of therapy in this very important need for patients. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress in our TARIS drug delivery platform. You are also going to see data being presented at ESMO. Very important for us in two existing products. We will be presenting data on TREMFYA in IBD, both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis for a potential approval later in 2024, that\u2019s going to be a very significant growth driver for TREMFYA, take into consideration that in the STELARA case, IBD represents 75% of the sales. So we still have a lot of growth in front of us with TREMFYA, as we do also in ERLEADA, in which we will present data in localized high-risk prostate cancer. We also, you know, we're also going to be able to present some data of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis end of this year. So all in all, very good news for our pipeline in 2024 and 2025. Certainly, the entrance of the biosimilars in 2025 in the U.S. is another factor that builds our confidence that we are going to be able to meet the $57 billion. For me the most important thing now is to look forward and to think about the growth profile of our innovative medicine group into the second-half of the decade. We have a number of growth drivers that are already there that I described, but also the strength of our pipeline both in immunology, in oncology, and in neuroscience profiles us as a strong company, as a strong growth profile into the second-half of the decade. And that's part of what we will be looking forward to discussing with you in our upcoming enterprise with review, focusing on what is going to be the growth profile in the second-half of the decade.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe Joe, just a little bit more color on 2024. Appreciate the details you provided. Seems like a year of another healthy top line growth. But can you just give us some directional color on margins next year? I know there are some dis-synergies with Kenvue this year. I was trying to get a sense of how you think about margin progression here as you kind of balance some of these, you know, kind of, the pipeline opportunities and some of these top line growth initiatives versus, kind of, dropping that to the bottom line. So if there's any directional color, it would be appreciated. Thanks.\nJoe Wolk: Yes, sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first off, we're very pleased with the margin progress that we've been able to make in 2023. I think we started the year to roughly flat to now improving by 50 basis points. A lot of that has really gone, is it directly attributable to the efforts of many people in the organization, who really took the opportunity to look at our infrastructure as a two segment company versus a three segment company. So dis-synergies that we warned about and talked about early on in the Kenvue separation process really haven't come to manifest. In fact, as we look out to 2024, we see minimal to almost no impact from dis-synergies from the separation. We are in the process of finalizing our business plans for 2024. I'd like to get a little bit better assessment of how the clinical development pipeline is shaping up, what the investments are required there. But we're a larger company. We take the opportunity to look each and every year at efficiencies. So we're not in a position to give you margin guidance right now, but I would expect that something similar to where we started this year would not be a bad starting point for next year. Again, it's going depend on the investments that the R&D teams from both MedTech and Innovative Medicines can bring forth, and we'll obviously look to accelerate bringing some of these great products to patients sooner if we have that opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, just -- could you just clarify what you meant by flat procedures in \u201824 MedTech? Are you assuming, does that mean flat MedTech growth? And just for my question, can you talk about what you're seeing with bariatrics, if for GLP-1s this is, and how you're thinking about the potential impact of GLP-1s across your device business, you know, long-term, you know, especially in Cardio and Ortho. Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: So I'll give the second half of that question to Joaquin, but thanks for the clarifying question with respect to market growth. We are not suggesting flat market, or a flat market in MedTech next year. What we do is, are foreseeing right now, based on what we know today, is the elevated levels, the market overall being 5% to 7% versus what traditionally has been maybe 4% to 6%. We see that same 5% to 7% next year. Joaquin?\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, and thank you Larry. And taking a step back, we see the evolution of our MedTech business in a very positive way. One of our key goals for us is to be a top tier grower in MedTech. When I look at the results of MedTech this year, we are delivering on that. Our growth in the quarter pro forma was 6.4% when you compare with Abiomed as a standalone company. And when you look at our pro forma growth year-to-date in MedTech is 7.9%. So very pleased with the performance of our MedTech business. And we have expectations to continue our progression into 2024, in part fueled by the procedural growth that we see and also, but our continued improvement in our execution and the launch of new products. Some of them we can discuss later. For example, you know, we will be launching our first PFA catheter in Europe into 2024. When it comes to GLP-1s, it's good for patients to have new options for treatment, especially in obesity, which at times has been a stigmatized disease in which patients were not looking for treatment due to the stigmatization of that. Certainly, as you commented, we're seeing some impact in our bariatric business in the short-term. Some patients are reconsidering surgery, expecting to get treatment. But overall, when we talk to surgeons, bariatric surgeons, what they see is a complementary role of surgery and GLP-1s, and many of them comment on the fact that they could see a tailwind for bariatric surgery down the road, given this complementary nature, the increased awareness about obesity, more patients seeking treatment, and many of the patients, about 30% of them, are not going to be tolerating this medication. So they would be another funnel for our bariatric business. In the rest of our MedTech business, at this point, we continue to see robust procedure increase and we don't anticipate that change, that thing -- that trend changing in the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more, John, on Nipocalimab in RA. I know we're going to see the full data here at ACR, but is this a drug that you see potentially working in a broad population or is there a biomarker subset group that's more likely to respond? And then how are you thinking about Phase 3 plans here in this indication? Thank you.\nJohn Reed: Yes, thanks for the question and we look forward to sharing those data at the ACR in November in San Diego. We're looking at Nipo as either a monotherapy combined with a precision medicine strategy or as a combination for a broad population where we aim to combine with an anti-TNF agent. We see those two mechanisms as being very complementary, reducing the levels of auto antibodies with Nipo and then inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms with the TNF. The so-called DAISY study, the Phase 2, is underway now and we'll test that combination. So that in general has been the way we're looking at RA, not only for Nipo, but other agents in our pipeline where we see the future being monotherapies that are targeted in a precision medicine way or broad therapies that are combos that can bring together synergistic mechanisms in a safe way. We're excited to be launching the DAISY program to look at that combo. And we're hoping that that will bring deeper, more durable remissions for patients as we bring those new mechanisms together.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Is it possible to give us a little bit more detail on a couple of things? You mentioned headwinds from VBP and I'm just curious if there's, A, way to quantify it; and B, a way to say if it's at least better or worse or the same as it has been the last couple of quarters? And then similarly in other aspects of China, we've been hearing a lot about anti-corruption policies, et cetera. If you could comment on that, that would be great. Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Joanne. And first, let me say that China for us is a key market, and a market in which we are delivering growth now, and we are going to continue to deliver a strong growth into 2024. So it's a key growth driver for us. So on one hand, certainly, VBP represents a headwind in price. And on the other hand, it also represents an opportunity as you can expand quality products, medical technologies into more patients. So there are a number of MedTech platforms now currently undergoing VBP headwinds, electrophysiology, spine, trauma, endocutters and energy, and these effects will last during 2023 and part of 2024. We have already anniversary our large joins VBP. So at this point, we have about 80% of our platforms that have been already affected by VBP. Again, as we look into 2024, we expect to continue to deliver a strong growth in China, and China remaining a key part of our growth. When it comes to the question that you were asking in anti-corruption side, we have a strong culture of compliance in our business. And at this point, we may see some limitations related to physician and surgeon access, but we are not seeing any material impact in any part of our business due to that, and we'll continue to monitor the situation. Overall, as I said, we continue to see China as a key driver of our growth and also as a key source of innovation moving into the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to maybe dive a little deeper on the immunology side. Appreciate some of the comments you made there already with -- for the quarter, the performance was very strong for several of your products there? So I'm just curious if there were any sort of one-time items there that we should be aware of. It's under like there's a lot of patient mix and market growth that you are commenting on? I'm curious if you can just highlight any sort of stocking or sort of one-time pricing adjustments that we should take into account as we look at future quarters? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. We are very pleased with the performance of our immunology business, especially we're pleased with the performance of TREMFYA with 25.1% growth in the quarter, which shows our ability to drive growth there. As I said before, TREMFYA currently is now indicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis as an analog. In the case of STELARA, that represents about 25% of the sales. So with the upcoming readouts, filing and potential approvals of ulcerative colitis and Chron's disease, we expect to have significant growth in TREMFYA. We talk about TREMFYA as a $5 billion product earlier in our Analyst Day in 2021. Now you can see clearly that we're going not only to meet that, but to clearly exceed that benchmark for TREMFYA. So when it comes to STELARA, we had also a very robust growth of close to 16%. In that case, there is a prior period adjustment in the quarter a year ago that represents about 600 basis points. So you should take that into consideration when you think about the STELARA growth. We are very pleased overall, as I said, with our immunology portfolio. Overall, our immunology portfolio in the quarter grew 12.4%, which is very strong considering that we also have headwinds there of REMICADE biosimilars. And we remain very excited about the immunology portfolio as a key driver for J&J. Our Innovative Medicines are going to be bringing significant improvements in IBD with TREMFYA as I recall, but also staying there, we have our target oral peptide which is going to be presenting some data soon that we already presented data in psoriasis. And also, we have the combination of [Technical Difficulty] and golimumab in IBD, which has presented also groundbreaking result, so very encouraged about our immunology portfolio and the ability to drive growth in the second-half of the decade more to be seen in our EBR later in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Ahmet, I wanted to actually bring you into the conversation here and ask about some of the innovation in MedTech and specifically, you guys have an Ottava Day coming up. And just curious what you can say about, a, what we get to see, obviously, appreciating you're not going to totally open the kimono and front run the day? But b, and probably most importantly, sort of, where you see Ottava ultimately fitting into the robotics landscape and helping contribute to a continued move higher robotics penetration? Thanks so much.\nAhmet Tezel: So first of all, thank you for the question. Similar to John, this is my first call as well. So really excited to be here, equally excited to be leading a team of talented scientists, engineers and physicians as we do smarter less invasive and more personalized solutions for our patients. So with respect to Ottava, we have made great progress on the platform. The team is really focused on combining a really differentiated architecture based on its software and hardware together with our best-in-class instruments, and we believe that combination of a differentiated architecture with instruments is going to enable us to have high value from day one. Now we will have more updates on Ottava next month, as you mentioned. And at that time, we will provide a lot more detail. But the one point I'll make is that even today, robotic-assisted surgery penetration is in single-digits. So there's still a lot of growth left in that segment. And we're really excited because Ottava brings a lot of differentiation. So we're very excited that we can make a big kind of path. We can open our path and growth there in that segment as well.\nJoaquin Duato: Danielle, if I may interject here on Ottava. I've been in touch with multiple surgeons around the world. And one common comment that I find is that they all want. They are rooting for Johnson & Johnson to come into the robotic surgical space. They want to have the service and the support that they have accustomed doing decades with our Ethicon business and they also want to be able to utilize the advanced instruments with whom they have grown. So what I see in the surgical space is that the surgeons want to have alternatives and they are all looking forward to having Johnson & Johnson play an important role in robotic surgery.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Danielle. We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you on the FLORA 2 results, if they impacted at all your thinking on your market opportunity for MARIPOSA and why or why not? Thank you.\nAhmet Tezel: No, I don't think it influences because it's really important to pay attention not only to progression-free survival, but also overall survival as well as the PFS-2 the survival in the second line of therapy. Unfortunately, with today's therapies, almost all lung cancer patients will eventually relapse. They will need a second line therapy. And we think chemo was best reserved for that circumstance where the patient now has failed the frontline targeted therapies. So I would really say, pay attention to overall survival, pay attention to that progression free survival to endpoint, because these are going to be, I think, really things that matter in terms of what the long-term outcome is for patients with EGF receptor mutant lung cancer. The -- we believe based on the data we'll present in the Presidential session at ESMO that the combination of RYBREVANT are bispecific antibody, the first bispecific ever approved for a solid tumor indication in elderly human as well as the third-generation small molecule oral EGF receptor Lazertinib, which is brain penetrant over mine. We believe that, that will become the new frontline standard-of-care for EGF receptor mutant lung cancer and offer patients durable remissions that are achieved in a chemo-free regimen.\nOperator: Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. I'm proud to present today the company's performance. This is the first quarter that we report as a new J&J, focused in health care innovation, in MedTech and in Pharmaceuticals. And I believe this new J&J has a better foundation to continue to drive growth for the next decade. We are achieving strong results in 2023 with our 7.5% adjusted operational growth in the quarter. It's the second quarter in a row that we have a beat and a risk of our guidance. And we continue to believe that we're going to have a very strong finish into 2023 and that reads well for a strong 2024, too. We have a dedicated team both in Innovative Medicines and in MedTech. And we think we are very well positioned, as I said, to carry the momentum that you are seeing in 2023 into 2024. Finally, we are looking forward to engaging all of you at Enterprise Business Review on December 5th. Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you.

This is my first time as a newcomer to J&J, and before I answer your question, David, I would just like to say I have to tell you I'm really enjoying being a new member of the J&J team. I've really been impressed with the culture inspired by our Credo with the caliber of our talent our people here at J&J and with the really strong performance of the pipeline. We've already launched two NMEs this year, Akeega for prostate cancer and TALVEY for myeloma, continuing our tradition in bringing new therapies in those agents, and we're positioned to deliver an average of more than two enemies per year between now and the close of the decade 2030. So the pipeline is very robust and it's exciting to be here and to be a part of it. So on to your question, the data will be presented at ESMO in a Presidential session. So we're embargoed until then. Abstracts will be available on [Wednesday] (ph). I can only say that the RYBREVANT Lazertinib combo did perform well head-to-head against Osimertinib. Our regimen is a chemo-free option for patients, which we think is important, and we'll present those data at ESMO. Yes, to follow up on Joaquin's comments, we've been progressively adding more and more capacity. That's included at our original launch site in New Jersey, but we're close to having an additional manufacturing site up and rolling in Europe, in Belgium, and also have recently increased our capacity by using some excess capacity that Novartis had to further bolster the number of slots that we can accommodate. One of the traditionally rate-limiting components of the therapy has been the lentivirus component, and there we've made really outstanding progress in-house, mastering that technology, increasing the scale at our factory in Switzerland. And we're in the process -- we're building, I think it will be available next year, another factory in the Netherlands to support the lentivirus component, which has sometimes been one of the rate limiting aspects. So altogether the capacity continues to ramp up and we continue to perfect the technology I would say. Same thing with the number of centers that are qualified to administer the therapy and we're also making progress on the number of countries where CARVYKTI will be available. So very excited, obviously, about the momentum with that. Really, that best-in-class CAR therapy, the CARTITUDE-4 data as you know, showed unprecedented progression-free survival benefit, a hazard ratio of 0.26, overall response rate of 99%, 86% complete response. Very durable for a one and done therapy that was well tolerated. The Grade 3 or above cytokine release syndrome was only 1.1%. So this is really, I think, now emerging as the preferred second line therapy. And we hope to do more such as bringing the front line as a possible alternative to stem cell transplant. Yes, thanks for the question and we look forward to sharing those data at the ACR in November in San Diego. We're looking at Nipo as either a monotherapy combined with a precision medicine strategy or as a combination for a broad population where we aim to combine with an anti-TNF agent. We see those two mechanisms as being very complementary, reducing the levels of auto antibodies with Nipo and then inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms with the TNF. The so-called DAISY study, the Phase 2, is underway now and we'll test that combination. So that in general has been the way we're looking at RA, not only for Nipo, but other agents in our pipeline where we see the future being monotherapies that are targeted in a precision medicine way or broad therapies that are combos that can bring together synergistic mechanisms in a safe way. We're excited to be launching the DAISY program to look at that combo. And we're hoping that that will bring deeper, more durable remissions for patients as we bring those new mechanisms together."

            "name": "Erik Haas",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Joe. The short answer is that we continue to pursue the four-pronged strategy that we communicated back in July. So let me quickly summarize those four prongs and highlight the salient developments and perhaps anticipate some follow-up questions about TALC. So the first prong, we are pursuing the appeal through to the Supreme Court of the United States of the July ruling by the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court that dismissed LTL's bankruptcy case. Notably, our appeal recently was joined by counsel representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants. Also, thereafter, the bankruptcy court certified the case for a direct appeal to the third circuit, bypassing the district court, because the bankruptcy court found that the appeal raises matters of significant public interest, the resolution of which would material advance the progress of the case and we fully agree with that assessment. The appeal challenges both the validity, as well as the application of the novel standard that was imposed by the third circuit that requires a showing of, \u201cimmediate financial distress\u201d to proceed with the bankruptcy case. That immediate financial distress requirement, which the third circuit did not specifically define, is nowhere in the bankruptcy code and is contrary to the standards that are implied -- employed by other circuits. Moreover, under any reasonable interpretation of that standard, we believe the record has fully established that LTL faced immediate financial distress due to the large volume of TALC claims that were asserted against it. In terms of timing, the third circuit could rule at any moment whether it will take the direct appeal or not. If it does, we expect briefing to take place over the next couple of months with a decision in the early 2024 timeframe. And because we do anticipate the third circuit will primarily affirm the application of its standards, we will immediately thereafter request the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split and decide if the third circuit's novel approach is an appropriate standard for deciding a motion to dismiss. We do not think it is. We hope to squeeze the cert petition to the Supreme Court into the first term in 2024, but if not, we will raise it in the second term. Working with the council, representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants more than we had previously that were along with us. Along with the -- in addition to the future claims representatives and together with the council and the future claims representatives were pursuing a consensual resolution of the TALC claims through another bankruptcy. And that is exactly what the bankruptcy court, the New Jersey bankruptcy court urged and strongly recommended that we do in its decision that actually dismissed the case. And the New Jersey court made those recommendations having found that LTL had made remarkable progress towards an equitable and efficient resolution to-date. So we are continuing on in that process. In terms of timing on the second prong, the consensual resolution is on the same trajectory as the initial bankruptcy plan with a vote expected in the next six months to determine whether the requisite super majority of claimants support the plan. Third, while those negotiations are proceeding, we will continue to vigorously defend the meritless TALC claims in the tort system. As you may have seen just this last week, we had a significant favorable ruling in that regard with the New Jersey's appellate court in the Barden case reversing a $223 million verdict against the company. The appellate court reversed because it determined the opinions of the leading plaintiff's experts were unsound, were unscientific, and were unsubstantiated. And it is that baseless nature of those expert opinions why we have prevailed in the vast majority of the cases that have been tried to-date. In terms of timing of the litigation, there are two additional mesothelioma cases that we expect will be tried this year with more to come in 2024. As with the Barden case, it's important to keep in mind that the ultimate resolution of those matters often is determined at the appellate level, not at the trial level, which is the place which occurs in the forms that the plaintiff lawyers choose. Finally, we will aggressively challenge the abuses of the judicial system by the mass tort plaintiff's bar and its experts with their own affirmative litigation. We mentioned last time that we brought two actions against the plaintiff's bar's lead experts for defaming our TALC products with publications premised unknowingly false propositions. And those are moving forward. They've been fully briefed with respect to the initial case motions and in terms of timing, we expect a ruling shortly from the Federal District Court in New Jersey, whether those matters may proceed to the discovery phase. So that's a quick summary. I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have regarding the strategy."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "So thank you for the question. And yes, I mean, our results in orthopedics were 2.6% growth overall. And part of it, as you mentioned is driven by seasonality. As we have commented, we are in a journey of improvement in orthopedics. We want to be number one and number two in every segment we compete. And that is a place where we are not there yet, but we are very confident that we are going to continue to make improvements by investing and by growing in the highest growth segments. We have made improvements in our portfolio, for example, on the knee side. We have a more complete portfolio now on the revision side, on the cementless side. We are launching now our VELYS orthopedics total robot, total knee surgery replacement in Europe. And we already have about 30,000 procedures that have been performed with our VELYS robotic system. Overall, we are increasing our penetration also in the ASCs, which is a fast-growing segment, and we see our performance continue to improve in the U.S. and globally. In this particular quarter, we also had some impact due to the impact of value-based procurement in China and also because of the impact of the Russia sanctions that was mentioned already in the previous remarks. So overall, in orthopedics, we are determined to continue our journey of improvement. We are focusing in having the right portfolio. We have a very strong team in the field, and as Joe has announced, and Joe can comment on that, we have a plan to be able to continue to improve our margins in orthopedics. Thank you, Geoff. And as you have seen in the progression quarter-over-quarter of CARVYKTI, we continue to have on one hand strong demand and on the other hand, progress in our manufacturing. We're also very encouraged by the data that came out with CARTITUDE-4 that eventually we make CARVYKTI also a medicine in early absence of therapy. So when it comes to our manufacturing progress, I'm going to let John explain what are we doing in order to be able to supply the strong demand that we are seeing in CARVYKTI today. Overall, what you can expect, Geoff, is that we -- you will continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in 2023 into also 2024. And, you know, Geoff, to your point, in multiple myeloma new product launches, we are also very encouraged by the launch of TECVAYLI and also the recent appointment of TALVEY. The progression of these medicines is exceeding our internal expectations and we already have about 2,000 healthcare professionals in the U.S. that are REM certified to be able to administer TECVAYLI and TALVEY. So very encouraging progress in these two medicines in multiple myeloma. And we expect to be able to break out TECVAYLI sales beginning in 2024. Thank you for the question. Certainly we have always been very confident in being able to hit our $57 billion target in 2025 for pharma. As I have explained before, there are a number of factors there, the first one and most important is the growth that we're having in our key assets, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, UPTRAVI, our long-acting injectables, and especially DARZALEX, we continues to have a tremendous trajectory gaining share in first line. We are encouraged, as I just commented, by the launches of CARVYKTI, the progression of SPRAVATO, and also the recent launches too, also in multiple myeloma of TECVAYLI and TALVEY. And looking into 2024, the remainder of the year, and also into 2025, we have some very exciting news in our pipeline. Some of them have been already commented. For example, the first chemo-free regimen as first line in EGFR mutated non-small lung cancer. We will be presenting the data of MARIPOSA in our ESMO and that potentially will be a filing and an approval in 2025. This would be a new standard of therapy in this line of therapy in this very important need for patients. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress in our TARIS drug delivery platform. You are also going to see data being presented at ESMO. Very important for us in two existing products. We will be presenting data on TREMFYA in IBD, both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis for a potential approval later in 2024, that's going to be a very significant growth driver for TREMFYA, take into consideration that in the STELARA case, IBD represents 75% of the sales. So we still have a lot of growth in front of us with TREMFYA, as we do also in ERLEADA, in which we will present data in localized high-risk prostate cancer. We also, you know, we're also going to be able to present some data of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis end of this year. So all in all, very good news for our pipeline in 2024 and 2025. Certainly, the entrance of the biosimilars in 2025 in the U.S. is another factor that builds our confidence that we are going to be able to meet the $57 billion. For me the most important thing now is to look forward and to think about the growth profile of our innovative medicine group into the second-half of the decade. We have a number of growth drivers that are already there that I described, but also the strength of our pipeline both in immunology, in oncology, and in neuroscience profiles us as a strong company, as a strong growth profile into the second-half of the decade. And that's part of what we will be looking forward to discussing with you in our upcoming enterprise with review, focusing on what is going to be the growth profile in the second-half of the decade. Thank you, and thank you Larry. And taking a step back, we see the evolution of our MedTech business in a very positive way. One of our key goals for us is to be a top tier grower in MedTech. When I look at the results of MedTech this year, we are delivering on that. Our growth in the quarter pro forma was 6.4% when you compare with Abiomed as a standalone company. And when you look at our pro forma growth year-to-date in MedTech is 7.9%. So very pleased with the performance of our MedTech business. And we have expectations to continue our progression into 2024, in part fueled by the procedural growth that we see and also, but our continued improvement in our execution and the launch of new products. Some of them we can discuss later. For example, you know, we will be launching our first PFA catheter in Europe into 2024. When it comes to GLP-1s, it's good for patients to have new options for treatment, especially in obesity, which at times has been a stigmatized disease in which patients were not looking for treatment due to the stigmatization of that. Certainly, as you commented, we're seeing some impact in our bariatric business in the short-term. Some patients are reconsidering surgery, expecting to get treatment. But overall, when we talk to surgeons, bariatric surgeons, what they see is a complementary role of surgery and GLP-1s, and many of them comment on the fact that they could see a tailwind for bariatric surgery down the road, given this complementary nature, the increased awareness about obesity, more patients seeking treatment, and many of the patients, about 30% of them, are not going to be tolerating this medication. So they would be another funnel for our bariatric business. In the rest of our MedTech business, at this point, we continue to see robust procedure increase and we don't anticipate that change, that thing -- that trend changing in the foreseeable future. Thank you, Joanne. And first, let me say that China for us is a key market, and a market in which we are delivering growth now, and we are going to continue to deliver a strong growth into 2024. So it's a key growth driver for us. So on one hand, certainly, VBP represents a headwind in price. And on the other hand, it also represents an opportunity as you can expand quality products, medical technologies into more patients. So there are a number of MedTech platforms now currently undergoing VBP headwinds, electrophysiology, spine, trauma, endocutters and energy, and these effects will last during 2023 and part of 2024. We have already anniversary our large joins VBP. So at this point, we have about 80% of our platforms that have been already affected by VBP. Again, as we look into 2024, we expect to continue to deliver a strong growth in China, and China remaining a key part of our growth. When it comes to the question that you were asking in anti-corruption side, we have a strong culture of compliance in our business. And at this point, we may see some limitations related to physician and surgeon access, but we are not seeing any material impact in any part of our business due to that, and we'll continue to monitor the situation. Overall, as I said, we continue to see China as a key driver of our growth and also as a key source of innovation moving into the future. Thank you. We are very pleased with the performance of our immunology business, especially we're pleased with the performance of TREMFYA with 25.1% growth in the quarter, which shows our ability to drive growth there. As I said before, TREMFYA currently is now indicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis as an analog. In the case of STELARA, that represents about 25% of the sales. So with the upcoming readouts, filing and potential approvals of ulcerative colitis and Chron's disease, we expect to have significant growth in TREMFYA. We talk about TREMFYA as a $5 billion product earlier in our Analyst Day in 2021. Now you can see clearly that we're going not only to meet that, but to clearly exceed that benchmark for TREMFYA. So when it comes to STELARA, we had also a very robust growth of close to 16%. In that case, there is a prior period adjustment in the quarter a year ago that represents about 600 basis points. So you should take that into consideration when you think about the STELARA growth. We are very pleased overall, as I said, with our immunology portfolio. Overall, our immunology portfolio in the quarter grew 12.4%, which is very strong considering that we also have headwinds there of REMICADE biosimilars. And we remain very excited about the immunology portfolio as a key driver for J&J. Our Innovative Medicines are going to be bringing significant improvements in IBD with TREMFYA as I recall, but also staying there, we have our target oral peptide which is going to be presenting some data soon that we already presented data in psoriasis. And also, we have the combination of [Technical Difficulty] and golimumab in IBD, which has presented also groundbreaking result, so very encouraged about our immunology portfolio and the ability to drive growth in the second-half of the decade more to be seen in our EBR later in the year. Danielle, if I may interject here on Ottava. I've been in touch with multiple surgeons around the world. And one common comment that I find is that they all want. They are rooting for Johnson & Johnson to come into the robotic surgical space. They want to have the service and the support that they have accustomed doing decades with our Ethicon business and they also want to be able to utilize the advanced instruments with whom they have grown. So what I see in the surgical space is that the surgeons want to have alternatives and they are all looking forward to having Johnson & Johnson play an important role in robotic surgery. Thank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. I'm proud to present today the company's performance. This is the first quarter that we report as a new J&J, focused in health care innovation, in MedTech and in Pharmaceuticals. And I believe this new J&J has a better foundation to continue to drive growth for the next decade. We are achieving strong results in 2023 with our 7.5% adjusted operational growth in the quarter. It's the second quarter in a row that we have a beat and a risk of our guidance. And we continue to believe that we're going to have a very strong finish into 2023 and that reads well for a strong 2024, too. We have a dedicated team both in Innovative Medicines and in MedTech. And we think we are very well positioned, as I said, to carry the momentum that you are seeing in 2023 into 2024. Finally, we are looking forward to engaging all of you at Enterprise Business Review on December 5th. Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day."

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson & Johnson with a sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech. What has remained consistent is our Credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137-year legacy of tackling the world's most complex healthcare challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world. As we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of healthcare. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future. Before we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business. The first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation, which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted timeframe and under budget, while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders. Through the separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue Debt Offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. We maintained our current quarterly dividend per share and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility. We will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024. Another item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to believe the IRA's price setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients. As we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by of us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS' drug price setting scheme to continue supporting patients' access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer. Moving to segment highlights in the quarter, as Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter, while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth. Within the innovative medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. And U.S. FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class, bi-specific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Regarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late breaking abstracts, including three featured in the Presidential Symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three Phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including MARIPOSA, MARIPOSA II, and PAPILLON. Additionally, updated data from the Sunrise 1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer will be shared, as well as the first ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGFR mutations. We also look forward to presenting Phase II data for Nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in November, and have already launched a Phase II combination study NRA. Lastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. This includes the initiation of the ANTHEM Phase 2B study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month, and the Phase III clinical program titled Iconic for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expected to begin in November. Moving to MedTech, notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform. We received FDA clearance from multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson & Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy-related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures. It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams. In pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE mark for our VARIPULSE Catheter. We expect the completion for our U.S. VARIPULSE study to occur in the fourth quarter. We are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STSF dual energy catheter, capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device, and Omnipulse, a large tip focal catheter. Beyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the Abiomed Impella ECP clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high-risk PCI procedures. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small bore access and closure techniques. While not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our orthopedic business. As part of this two-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. We anticipate some short-term modest revenue disruption in orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability. The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the $5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute a strategic and disciplined approach utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth, and executing share repurchases when appropriate. Moving onto our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first nine months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full-year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%, or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%. Just a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue. While we do not speculate on future currency movements utilizing the euro spot rate as of last week at 1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million resulting in a full-year impact of negative 1% or $800 million. Looking across the P&L, adjusted pre-tax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained, ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Due to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million. And finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 to $10.08 or 12.5% growth at the midpoint, and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13 or 13% growth at the midpoint. Since January, We've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and $0.25 on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing $0.10 for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023. Now I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024, and our teams are actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider. For innovative medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all while advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings, and approvals ahead of us. This includes data presentations and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our Phase III study of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis, and readouts from two Phase III or ELITA trials in early-stage prostate cancer. We do not expect the entry of STELARA Biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid-2024 in Europe. For MedTech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all MedTech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness, while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, Abiomed, and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels. With respect to tax, as you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's Pillar 2 Directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD Pillar 2 framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1st, 2024. As a result, we currently estimate it up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024. In addition, the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of U.S. incentives for innovation and will result in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Regarding share count given the Kenvue separation, the full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson & Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate $0.15 negative currency impact on 2024 full-year adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our strong performance during the first nine months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our innovative medicine and MedTech pipelines, and the long-term strategy of Johnson & Johnson at our upcoming Enterprise Business Review on December 5th at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule, will be shared shortly. We hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the available webcast. I want to conclude my remarks by thanking our teams around the world for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to excellence on behalf of our patients. We are confident that our strategy will position us to deliver long-term growth and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, it's my pleasure to turn to Kevin and begin the Q&A portion of the call. Yes, just very quickly, Matt, thanks for the question. With respect to the restructuring program that we announced specifically in orthopedics, we're looking to exit those less profitable markets and product lines. So we'll have some clearly inventory write-downs as a result of that. Over the next two years, there will be some modest revenue disruption, but we actually do think these actions not only accelerate growth going forward, but will improve profitability. Hey, so Eric, why don't I turn it over to you to discuss the TALC litigation matter and then I'll come back and answer Chris's second question. Great. Thank you, Eric. Chris, regarding your second question, you know, if J&J had a nickel for every time voracious was quoted back to me since the second quarter earnings, we probably could have taken up guidance even a little bit more. And while that's often associated with wanting or devouring great quantities, I think it's really the second definition in webster's where having a very eager approach to an activity is the construct in which I meant that term in the second quarter. So I could have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, my predecessors could have said that. We routinely, almost weekly meet on new opportunities that may complement our existing portfolio or our future pipeline in both MedTech and Innovative Medicines. And the current moment is no different. In fact, we're in a very good position, given the low levels of net debt, the cash we were able to raise to fulfill one of our capital allocation priorities, which you're probably very, very familiar with at this point in time. But we're not going to compromise our principles in making sure that it's a strategic fit. So it fits into the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities, or the global reach that will add value to that asset in our hands versus someone else. And we're going to make sure that we're disciplined in that approach financially by ensuring that we have a return that's commensal with the risk that we're bearing on behalf of shareholders. So we'd much rather have an okay deal pass us by, then make a bad deal. And that's kind of the principles that we'll live into. There's no deal that's too big, give it our credit rating, as well as our financial strength and annual cash flow generation. But as you know, we've had great success doing smaller, earlier-stage deals as well. We're agnostic with respect to whether it'd be the next one being MedTech or Innovative Medicines, we are simply looking for the best qualified deal that meets both strategic and financial parameters. So hopefully that answers your question. Next question, Kevin? Yes, sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first off, we're very pleased with the margin progress that we've been able to make in 2023. I think we started the year to roughly flat to now improving by 50 basis points. A lot of that has really gone, is it directly attributable to the efforts of many people in the organization, who really took the opportunity to look at our infrastructure as a two segment company versus a three segment company. So dis-synergies that we warned about and talked about early on in the Kenvue separation process really haven't come to manifest. In fact, as we look out to 2024, we see minimal to almost no impact from dis-synergies from the separation. We are in the process of finalizing our business plans for 2024. I'd like to get a little bit better assessment of how the clinical development pipeline is shaping up, what the investments are required there. But we're a larger company. We take the opportunity to look each and every year at efficiencies. So we're not in a position to give you margin guidance right now, but I would expect that something similar to where we started this year would not be a bad starting point for next year. Again, it's going depend on the investments that the R&D teams from both MedTech and Innovative Medicines can bring forth, and we'll obviously look to accelerate bringing some of these great products to patients sooner if we have that opportunity. So I'll give the second half of that question to Joaquin, but thanks for the clarifying question with respect to market growth. We are not suggesting flat market, or a flat market in MedTech next year. What we do is, are foreseeing right now, based on what we know today, is the elevated levels, the market overall being 5% to 7% versus what traditionally has been maybe 4% to 6%. We see that same 5% to 7% next year. Joaquin?"

I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. This was a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson with market leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical, our MedTech pipelines and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call. We're excited about entering a new era for Johnson & Johnson one built around science, innovation and technology and strategically focused on pharmaceutical and MedTech, while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today's call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results, as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near and long-term future performance. Starting with MedTech, for the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition. On a pro forma basis using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working. Q2 highlights in Electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest Ablation Catheter for Atrial Fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86%, as well as achieving shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month, we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfiRE study evaluates our dual energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source whether radio frequency or pulsed field based on patient needs. The Abiomed integration continued to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's public reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations. We anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multiyear growth platform for Johnson & Johnson. In orthopedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution is poised for further acceleration, having recently received CE and CA Mark international approvals. In Surgery, we are pleased with our progression on Ottava, our next generation soft tissue surgical robotic system, and we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In Vision, we recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX and TECNIS Eyhance and we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision. Now turning to pharmaceuticals. In the second quarter of the year, we delivered above market operational growth of 6.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year-on-year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. These new launches along with SPRAVATO are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target. We also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I\u2019m particularly excited by include: first, the receipt of fast track designation from the U.S. FDA for all three prospective indications for Milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options, due to bleeding risk. Second, the recent submission of a supplemental BLA for CARVYKTI to the FDA and European Commission supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association meeting. And finally, we announced positive top line results from the Phase 3 PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. This is the first of several ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies to read out for RYBREVANT based regimens in EGFR mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the Phase 2 study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our Novel Oral IL23 Receptor Antagonist Peptide in Psoriasis. The finding suggests that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL23 mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into Phase 3 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and initiating a Phase 2b in ulcerative colitis and will continue to assess additional opportunities. We are very excited about the potential of this asset and believe it represents $1 billion plus commercial opportunity. We also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including STELARA. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our STELARA IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the U.S. on January 1, 2025 and Alvotech to launch in the U.S. on February 21, 2025. In all, our pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results. Our pipeline is progressing well and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 sales target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a two sector Johnson & Johnson with a higher growth profile. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail. Jess?\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Joaquin. As a reminder on May 8, 2023, Kenvue, Inc., closed its initial public offering. Johnson & Johnson continues to own 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue\u2019s common stock and remains the majority shareholder. Therefore, the following financial results continue to include the consumer health business with the 10.4% of consumer health's net earnings no longer attributed to Johnson & Johnson being adjusted for in other income and expense from the date of the IPO through the end of the quarter. Starting with Q2 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $25.5 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.3% versus the second quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.5%, as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 10.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.7% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.5 points. Operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth with 6.2% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.96 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.80 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.80, representing increases of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.7%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2022, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.7 billion increased 3.1%, with growth of 9.2% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 3.8% as currency had a negative impact of 0.7 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, Worldwide operational sales growth was 6.2% with growth of 9.9% in the U.S. and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. STELARA grew 8%, driven by market growth and IBD share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and increased rebates. TREMFYA grew 18.9%, driven by market growth and share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of 16.5% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains in the U.S. and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. Total pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 12.9% with growth of 14.6% in the U.S. and 11.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 14.7% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. Abiomed contributed 4.8% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.9%. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all MedTech businesses driven by global procedure growth, recovery in China, continued uptake of recently launched products and commercial execution, partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume based procurement in China, as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 56.9%, which includes $331 million related to Abiomed. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to the growth with a double-digit increase of 25.9%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our comprehensive portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RS catheter. Orthopedics operational growth of 5.7%, reflects strong procedure recovery, success of recently launched products, such as the enhanced shorter portfolio, as well as global expansion of our digital solutions, such as VELYS Robotic assisted solution. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China and continued supply challenges primarily in hips. Operational growth of 8.4% and surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 6.9% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance our monofocal intraocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges. Although these continue to improve. Moving to the Consumer Health segment. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $4 billion increased 5.4% with growth of 6% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all consumer health franchises, primarily driven by strategic price increases and growth in OTC globally, due to strong pain performance, and cold, cough and flu season. Excluding the impact of strategic portfolio decisions and sales of personal care products in Russia, volume across all consumer franchises was relatively flat on strong price actions. For more detailed information, please visit investors.kenvue.com. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for second quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related costs in the pharmaceutical business, partially offset by commodity inflation in the consumer and MedTech businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins deleveraged 20 basis points, driven by incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, partially offset by proactive management of costs. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was a 3.4% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was income of $60 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements, lower litigation expense, and lower unrealized losses on securities, partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related cost. And as previously mentioned, the 10.4% of consumer health earnings that are no longer attributable to Johnson & Johnson, which resulted in a $37 million reduction in consolidated earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9% versus 17.6% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2023 tax cost incurred as part of the planned separation of the consumer health business, due to the internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.6% versus 15.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 34% to 34.6%, primarily driven by favorable product and patient mix, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix and commodity inflation. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 42% to 42.7%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix, sales, marketing and administrative expense leverage, and R&D portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments. MedTech margins improved from 26.5% to 28.6%, driven by favorable intellectual property related litigation settlements and cost management initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 25.9% to 23.5%, due to incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, foreign exchange impacts, and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. It is important to highlight that the adjusted income before tax for the consumer health business as reported by Johnson & Johnson defers from the financial results reported by Kenvue Inc. this morning. The difference is primarily driven by incremental costs required to run Kenvue as an independent company. Additional differences also exist on an after tax basis, due to the application of different tax rates. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first-half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by pharmaceuticals excluding COVID-19 revenue accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased to 4.5% over an already strong first quarter. During the first-half of the year we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world. We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue. On May 8th, as partial consideration for the transfer of the Consumer Health business, Kenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson & Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today, we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue, subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation. As part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson's shareholders will have the choice to exchange all some or none of their shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock subject to the terms of an offer. We believe a split off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson & Johnson, Kenvue and our shareholders, specifically an exchange offer provides Johnson & Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at one time in a tax free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. Offer terms for the exchange inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $46 billion of debt for a net debt position of $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $7 billion of 10 Kenvue net debt. Free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion, compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year. The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit related matters. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends, increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth, and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&D investment in the first-half of 2023 was $7.4 billion or approximately 15% of sales. This includes external investments such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on two next generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B-cell malignancies further broadening our cell therapy portfolio. In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases and in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September of 2022, and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of 2023. Let's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split off transaction I will remind you that our updated full-year guidance today continues to include results from the Consumer Health Business given Johnson & Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue. I suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson & Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson & Johnson. When Johnson & Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updated new Johnson & Johnson guidance that will reflect among other things the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson & Johnson's performance, as well as any updates to Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count. So with that context, moving on to our full-year guidance. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full-year operational sales and EPS guidance, despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule. Specifically the lost income related to the approximate 10% non-controlling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in process research and development cost related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8% or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at $1.10. The Euro spot rate as of mid-last week remains at $1.10. However, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies such as the Won and the Yen. As such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5%, compared to 2022 with a midpoint of $99.3 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L, we now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company\u2019s 10.4% non-controlling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense, we now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of a $150 million to $250 million, due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation. And finally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. Constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and healthcare staffing levels in the back half of the year with normal seasonality. We expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution recently launched products and improvement in supply. Headwinds from volume based procurement in China, as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia are expected to be higher in the second-half than the first-half of the year. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. We expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year slightly higher than the first-half. When modeling consumer health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year. Given the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near and long-term value. Beyond the separation, in the near-term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech with better commercial execution and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there are still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT MICRO Catheter in the U.S. during the second-half of this year. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution, recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year. And in Vision, we are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations such as ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day multifocal, which is driving Johnson & Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market. We look forward to continued growth from this and other recent Vision launches. Related to our pharmaceutical business, we are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets, including on the regulatory front there is expected approval of [daratumumab] (ph) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Clinically, we expect a Phase 3 data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in front line non-small cell lung cancer with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting. Phase 1 data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Phase 2 data for Nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. A couple of other items to highlight. In case you missed them, we recently published our Health For Humanity report our U.S. Pharmaceutical pricing transparency report and our U.S. patent table, all of which can be found on our website. Also, a reminder that we will be hosting an enterprise business review featuring both Pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 5th. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first-half of the year both financially and operationally and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second-half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Erik Haas.\nErik Haas: Thank you, Joe. On Tuesday, July 18th in the case of Valadez v Johnson & Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on this talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder. Without the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with a decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence in over 40-years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc. The verdict award will not be paid, while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on a -- our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner. Looking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy re-filing by LTL, the bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by August 2nd the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed, reorganization plan and voting procedures process, and the path forward is scheduled for August 22nd. As we previously stated, Johnson & Johnson stands by its physician that is talcum powder products are safe as confirmed through decades of numerous independent scientific tests and studies. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jess.\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Erik. This concludes the prepared remarks section of our call. I will now turn the discussion over to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on another strong quarter here. For Erik, if Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy proposal, what's the backup settlement in mind that would proceed outside of bankruptcy that could ring fence the cost? And Joe or Joaquin, in MedTech, how are you thinking about the sustainability of the first half strength where you grew 8% organic? Do you still expect the MedTech market to grow 5% to 7% this year with J&J in that range, it seems conservative? Thanks for taking the question.\nErik Haas: Larry, hi it's Erik. Thanks for the question. If Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy, we will be back in the tort system, and in that scenario we intend to fight the claims aggressively. And indeed, based upon the indicated decades of scientific support for the safety of our talc products, the fact that our talc products do not contain asbestos and the fact that our talc products do not cause cancer, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to prevail in the vast majority of claims as we have done in the past in the tort system.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Larry, and thank you for complimenting us on the results on the first quarter and also on the MedTech ones. When it comes to the MedTech results, the growth in the first-half of the year was north of 8%. So this is a continuation of the sustained improvement in our performance that we have had in the last couple of years in which we have grown at or above our competitive composite. When we think about the dynamics that are driving our growth, which are multiple. One is the recovery in the overall market procedures, which is helping our improved commercial execution and very especially the cadence and flow of new product launches that we are having in the market. We see our trajectory in MedTech in the first-half of the year continuing in the second-half of the year. So we expect a similar trajectory for MedTech in the second-half of the year.\nJoe Wolk: Yes, Larry, maybe I might just add to Joaquin's comments. The only thing that is limiting the growth, I would say, in the back half of the year is China volume-based pricing, as well as some international sanctions in Russia, but those are already incorporated into our outlook for the balance of 2023. So we feel we have those well in hand. If there's a little bit of abatement on either of those fronts, it portends well for the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So maybe just one on the guidance commentary. So appreciate what you said around the Kenvue and Cellular Biomedicine dynamics. But I'm curious about STELARA, because you have the two settlements now. I don't think there's any chance for having a biosimilar enter this year. And I think before, you had expected that. So I'm curious what your expectations are now in terms of biosimilar entry before Amgen? And how does that impact sort of your guidance expectation for this year, and if you want to comment on sort of next year or sort of how it might impact 2025 with the $57 billion there? And then one also, other one if I could just on MARIPOSA, we've been getting a lot of questions just sort of what's changed there? I know before, the study is supposed to end next year. We obviously heard about the interim on your last earnings call. But then in the last few weeks, it sounds like there's a chance we'll get the data sooner this year than you may be able to present it. So kind of what's changed from April to now to give you a sense that the data may come a little bit earlier and give you a chance to present it this year? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Thanks for the questions, Vamil. I'll start with STELARA and then see if Erik can add anything from a legal perspective, and then we'll hand it over to Joaquin for your question on the MARIPOSA study. With respect to STELARA this year, there won't be a significant impact. As you can imagine, most of that business was contracted for the full-year about this time last year. So there really wasn't any material impact. And our current assumption based on some of the agreements you read about similar to what we've said previously is that we wouldn't expect anything before January 1, 2025. I don't know, Erik, from a legal perspective, anything to add?\nErik Haas: Yes. Thanks, Joe. From a litigation perspective, I could say that no other biosimilar is better positioned in our view than Amgen or Alvotech would be. So we would not anticipate any other biosimilar having the opportunity or ability to enter the market before those two.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. And with respect to MARIPOSA, nothing has changed. We -- this is an event-driven study with a final analysis expected as we said by the end of 2023 with a potential to be presented at a major medical meeting in 2023. We remain excited about the potential of RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib to become a new standard-of-care in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. And we are looking forward to be able to present these results in due time in a medical meeting potentially this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. I'm trying to think about two things as I look forward to, given the strength in the first half of the year in MedTech, does this create, in your opinion, a new base from which we grow from? Or are we going to be writing about difficult comps next year? And second of all, with Kenvue's splitoff by within days or by the end of this year, I anticipate, how do we think about different investments in the MedTech and Pharmaceutical franchises either through pure R&D internally or externally? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: So as I commented in the earlier question, we are pleased with the strength of our MedTech business in the first-half of the year with 8% growth. We -- this is driven by market growth, which we believe it's also slightly elevated this year due to the clearing of the COVID-19 backlog. And at the same time, as I commented to our improved commercial execution and the introduction of new products. Of note, of our $12 billion platforms in MedTech, all of them have grown during the first-half of the year. And we are being quite successful in introducing some important new products in all segments of our business. For example, if I start with electrophysiology, that grew north of 25% in the quarter. We have introduced a new mapping catheter OCTARAY and also a new treatment catheter QDOT, which, as you know, Joanne, we presented results about QDOT. So we increased efficacy and procedure efficiency, too. If we move into Vision, we are in the middle of the launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX, which is doing well and also the launch of our TECNIS Eyhance, the first mono-focal intraocular lens, which is progressing also very well. Moving into Orthopaedics. The good news is that we have received CE Mark and CA Mark for our Robotic-Assisted System VELYS. And we continue to have an enhanced portfolio of knees and hips with our Cementless knees, the Medial Stabilized and in the area of hips with hip navigation and the recent addition of CUPTIMIZE and we see our market position there also progressing. And moving forward, we will continue to see good evolution also in Orthopaedics. Finally, in Surgery, we continue to enhance our endocutter and our energy portfolio with the launch of ENSEAL jaw curved and also with the launch of ECHELON 3000 in the stapler side. So overall, good reception of our new products. That portend well for a continuation of growth, as I said before, in the second half of the year. And we look forward also to the different readouts of our PFA pipeline, which as we have announced, we have completed the enrollment of our dual energy catheter, which is going to be offering the physicians the comfort of a catheter that is the most well used with the option of having both radio frequency and PFA to adapt to every patient anatomy. And then on the robotic side, we will provide you more updates on our progress on OTTAVA, our soft tissue robotics system, before the end of the year as we committed. And we have also good news on our Monarch system that has already started with the first patient treated in removal of kidney stone. So overall, good progress during the year. Clearly, our MedTech business is doing well, delivering competitive growth. And we have good news in innovation as the year moves forward.\nJoe Wolk: And Joanne, with respect to your second question and completing the Consumer Health separation, our capital allocation priorities aren't changing. So we're going to continue to invest organically in our own pipeline. You saw that we pretty much have kept our percent to sales, which is -- leads across industries as a top 10 investor in R&D on an annual basis. We prioritize that. We realize that, that is underpinning our future success. As we have demonstrated, the dividends and the share repurchases that we've done this year has already returned a significant amount back to shareholders. And then we'll always be on the hunt for real good strategic opportunities that fit with either the clinical or science expertise we have or commercial capabilities that we can offer that drive more value out of a potential asset in our hands than where it currently resides. So we are looking feverishly as we always do across both MedTech and Pharm.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just the first one is, would love just some additional views on the $57 billion pharma target by 2025. It seems like between the pipeline progress we've seen this year and the STELARA settlements, you've had some clear positive updates over the past few months. And I'm just wondering, just level of confidence in that target, and has that increased as we've gone through this year? And then my second question was just for Erik on talc. Is there any update in terms of the number of plaintiffs where you have an agreement on the settlement terms relative to where we stood with the comments in April? And just where you stand right now relative to that 75% threshold you ultimately need? Thanks so much.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Chris. And let me start with your first question. We have always been confident on the fact that we will reach our $57 billion target by 2025 as we announced back in 2021. And certainly, what we are seeing now increases and reinforces and enhances our confidence. On one hand, you're seeing the progression of our pharmaceutical portfolio and our existing products with excellent results in DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA, also in our pulmonary hypertension franchise and in our long-acting injectable antipsychotic franchise, which are key products in this period. We are very pleased with the trajectory of our new product launches, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and SPRAVATO. If I focus on CARVYKTI, you see a clear improvement quarter-over-quarter in CARVYKTI, which reflects improvements in supply. In TECVAYLI, you see also a clear improvement of note. When we look at the TECVAYLI launch, align data with DARZALEX in the addressable patient population. TECVAYLI it\u2019s having a faster introduction. And finally, SPRAVATO, which is doing well. And now we see SPRAVATO as a $1 billion plus product, and you're seeing the results this quarter also reaching close to $170 million. If we look at our pipeline and the products of the pipeline that are going to impacting this period, we are expecting the PDUFA date of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody, which is going to give another option in the treatment of multiple myeloma. And we continue to progress and execute well in some of the key products in our pipeline. I commented on RYBREVANT and the combination of Lazertinib, as you know. We received fast track destination for the three key indications of milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant that we are working in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We presented very positive data about TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in meeting in the American Urological Association. And we also -- when it comes to CARVYKTI, we were very pleased to show the data on CARTITUDE-4. We are filing the BLA now, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we are expecting to show you some data on nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. We also have already presented in hemolytic disease of the features of the new wall. So in every angle of the products that we highlighted as the core products of our pipeline, we are executing well. Plus we recently presented in the World Congress of Dermatology our data in our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide, which show great efficacy in psoriasis. And we have announced plans to continue developing into psoriasis and also a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis. So overall, when I look at the picture for 2025, we have increased confidence based on our portfolio, in our new product launches and how we are executing on our pipeline. But now I would like to look even beyond \u201825 if you allow me, Chris, because 2025 is very close. It's only three years from now. So what I think is what you are seeing with this renewal of our portfolio is a very strong position for Johnson & Johnson in Pharmaceuticals beyond 2025. And that's something that we need to highlight, and I think it's important for everybody to recognize. This is going to put us in a great position beyond 2025.\nErik Haas: Turning to the question with respect to the number of claimants. Good and important question. The most recent update comes from the hearing on the motions to dismiss that finished on June 30th. And I would refer you to the post-trial findings of fact and conclusions in law that were filed last night that really detailed the evidentiary record that was elicited during the hearing. Based upon that testimony that was elicited and the evidence that went in, we are now looking at approximately 60,000 claimants in support or lawyers who represent 60,000 claimants in support of the plan and lawyers who represent about 40,000 claimants in opposition. So the numbers right now show that the vast majority of claimants support the proposed plan. Based upon the testimony during that hearing from the lawyers that support those claimants, we are confident that, that support will not waver. And we do anticipate that additional support will be coming forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nTrung Huynh: Oh, hi. Thanks for the questions. Just two if I may. So just on -- thanks for your thoughts on the talc outcome. Should we just expect any more similar suits like the one in Alameda in the near future? And then secondly, do you know just a clarification on MARIPOSA if another interim passed for MARIPOSA? Thanks very much.\nJoaquin Duato: So let me start with the MARIPOSA. No, I mean, we are -- as we communicated, we are moving into a final analysis by the end of the year, potentially presenting the data at the end of the year.\nErik Haas: And with respect to the talc suits, we don't anticipate additional individual actions to go up for it outside the bankruptcy. Judge Kaplan lifted the stay only with respect to that one particular case, the Valdez case. Indeed, subsequent to that, he denied a request from the same counsel to lift the stay on another case. So currently, I would not anticipate any other case to go forward in advance of a ruling on the motion to dismiss.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for all the color. I had two, I was wondering, Joaquin, we've talked a lot about the myeloma market evolution over the last decade or so. J&J has been a leader there. This is a $20 billion market. You obviously have a number of different options now for patients, including TECVAYLI most recently and talquetamab with upcoming PDUFA date. So I guess my question is just top down, what prevents you from capturing a majority share of that $20 billion market? And then, Joe, a question for you on margins post Kenvue. Any early idea you can give us in terms of how that structure could evolve post the full separation?\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. So thank you for the question. And the answer is nothing prevents us from doing that. As a matter of fact, our aspiration in myeloma is that with the portfolio that we have today with DARZALEX, TECVAYLI, talquetamab and CARVYKTI, we would be in a position to have three out of every four patients starting in Janssen containing regimen by the end of this decade. So that's our aspiration in myeloma. Our aspiration is that there is a Janssen regimen for every line of therapy and a Janssen treatment for every patient irrespective of their characteristics. And that's the way we are planning our development. Certainly, DARZALEX being a backbone of therapy, first line and also in combination with multiple agents and then sequencing into CARVYKTI and talquetamab and TECVAYLI, which we are studying in combination with DARZALEX and also in combination among each other and sequencing among them. So ultimately, our goal when it comes to multiple myeloma is to be able to sequence our medicines, combine them in a way that we are changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And that is a big, big, big plus in our portfolio. And as I have commented often, multiple myeloma is the core of our Pharmaceutical franchise and the number one growth driver that is going to be for 2025 and beyond. There's more factors that give us optimism about the business potential of this area is that as we combine and as we seek those treatments, the treatment duration itself is going to be significantly increased. So we overall foresee great patient and growth opportunity as we look to combine all these modalities, as I said, in order to be able to convert multiple myeloma into a chronic disease.\nJoe Wolk: And Terence, thanks for the question regarding margins. And specifically, I think you're getting at the heart of the potential deleverage that could occur with the separation once Kenvue is on its own entirely. You may recall a couple of quarters ago on one of these calls, we said that there was potentially $500 million to $750 million of deleverage in SG&A. We embarked on an initiative, and I guess the benchmarks would suggest companies usually take about two to three years to get those costs out of their system. Last summer, we really embarked on a project to eliminate those costs in a much faster cadence. And I would say of that $500 million to $750 million, there's a small fraction that may remain, and we're still working to eliminate that. So you should expect as you're modeling no deleveraging or very, very little deleveraging from the Kenvue separation.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking a question. Just a follow-up on some of the capital allocation commentary. Joe, I appreciate what you're saying that things haven't changed. But I'm just curious now that you guys have integrated Abiomed, you're seeing some success there, how your appetite for specifically within medical devices and MedTech, how your appetite for potentially larger deals may have changed? And are there any specific areas you would call out within cardiology now that you do have Abiomed or just with -- throughout medical devices as areas of interest or where you feel underscaled and you might benefit from building out there? Thanks so much.\nJoe Wolk: Yes. Good to speak with you Danielle. And I know you directed the question to me, and I'll answer with one word. I would say our appetite is pretty voracious at this point. But I'll leave it to Joaquin with respect to the size of the deals. I don't think it -- unequivocally doesn't change, whether it's big or small, it has to be a really good strategic fit utilizing the expertise and capabilities that we have and has to provide financial value. Joaquin, maybe you want to comment on any specific areas that [Indiscernible]?\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. Thank you, Danielle. And before I go there, let me say that the Abiomed integration is progressing really well. The growth of Abiomed, it's been 20% on the quarter and we continue to move forward with the enrollment in the key PMA studies, PROTECT and STEMI DTU as well as the Impella ECP. So everything is moving well according to plan in the Abiomed integration. And we are increasingly convinced that this is going to be a key component of our MedTech strategy in becoming a leader in heart recovery. So when it comes to M&A, look, we continue to look for opportunities. And our number one criteria in looking for opportunities is the medical innovation, how they improve patient care, how do we see the science behind the product. So we are agnostic in that sense to MedTech and Pharmaceuticals. It's all about identifying areas that are going to have a significant impact in patient care. When it comes to MedTech, certainly, as we have commented, we are continuing to look forward for opportunities to grow into areas that are close to where we are today. Vision, cardiovascular obviously, surgery too and also opportunities in certain high-growth segments of Orthopaedics. And we normally will continue to look for these opportunities, trying to have a good return on capital, as well as things that are close to our existing expertise. When it comes to Pharma, our history in tuck-ins, in license and collaboration has been very successful. As a matter of fact, external innovation represents about 50% of our pipeline. And while we will continue to look for opportunities like we have done now with Cellular Biomedicines and the agreement that we have too in CAR-T, we are not averse to other transactions of larger size. Evidently both in MedTech and in pharma, we are very disciplined with our capital allocation. And all our transactions will have to clear certain financial milestones for us to be able to move on. But M&A and also licensing acquisition collaborations remains a key factor in our growth moving forward.\nJessica Moore: Thanks. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi, congratulations on the quarter. And thank you for taking my questions here. So I wanted to ask you where your latest thoughts on IRA are and the potential impact to the drug industry and also to J&J? And second question was just on CARVYKTI. Just curious how you expect to enter into earlier lines of treatment and then more widely into the community? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Yes. So let me start with the IRA. Obviously, we remain very concerned about the government price-setting environment that the IRA creates, which we believe creates a significant disincentive to innovation without addressing the core problem, which is patient access. So it is a significant concern for us. And that's one of the reasons, as we commented earlier, that we have filed a lawsuit versus the IRA. So that's important for us. Then when it comes to the actual business impact, I think it's still early to be able to calculate it, given the fact that many of the rules and procedures are still in flux. So it would be too much to be able to try to anticipate that. In our case, when we look at Johnson & Johnson, relatively speaking towards the industry based on our diversification between MedTech and Pharma and also the diversification of our Pharma portfolio, we feel that we are well positioned competitively to continue to grow way beyond the second-half of this decade. So we remain concerned. But at the same time, we think we are prepared to be able to manage successfully any situation coming from that relative to other industry players. The second question was about CARVYKTI. As I commented earlier, we are working to improve CARVYKTI supply, which is very important. You've seen that improvement in our sales in the second quarter. We are working in different ways. One is we are increasing capacity. We have internalized the production of lentivirus now. And also, we are in the process of increasing the number of slots internally. And also, we have reached agreements with other companies like Novartis to continue to increase capacity. So we are going to be in the trajectory of increasing capacity gradually in order to be able to eventually meet the demand that exists in CARVYKTI. As far as reaching to other patient populations, the CARVYKTI 4, it's already been filed. And it's moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy, and we are also working in first line with CARVYKTI 5 and CARVYKTI -- excuse me, with CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6. So we are clearly intending to move CARVYKTI through CARTITUDE-4, CARTITUDE-5, and CARTITUDE-6 into earlier lines of therapy. And we are increasingly convinced of the potential of CARVYKTI to be one of our more than $5 billion assets that we announced back in 2021.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Louise, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining this call today. I'm extremely proud of the performance that we have achieved in the first-half of 2023. We are entering the back half of the year from a position of strength with numerous catalysts, including the fact that we are going to be a two-sector company focused on Pharmaceutical and MedTech recent development and innovation. We look forward to having future engagements with you to update you on our continued progress. Thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first-half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by pharmaceuticals excluding COVID-19 revenue accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased to 4.5% over an already strong first quarter. During the first-half of the year we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world. We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue. On May 8th, as partial consideration for the transfer of the Consumer Health business, Kenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson & Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today, we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue, subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation. As part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson's shareholders will have the choice to exchange all some or none of their shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock subject to the terms of an offer. We believe a split off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson & Johnson, Kenvue and our shareholders, specifically an exchange offer provides Johnson & Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at one time in a tax free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. Offer terms for the exchange inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $46 billion of debt for a net debt position of $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $7 billion of 10 Kenvue net debt. Free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion, compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year. The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit related matters. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends, increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth, and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&D investment in the first-half of 2023 was $7.4 billion or approximately 15% of sales. This includes external investments such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on two next generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B-cell malignancies further broadening our cell therapy portfolio. In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases and in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September of 2022, and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of 2023. Let's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split off transaction I will remind you that our updated full-year guidance today continues to include results from the Consumer Health Business given Johnson & Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue. I suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson & Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson & Johnson. When Johnson & Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updated new Johnson & Johnson guidance that will reflect among other things the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson & Johnson's performance, as well as any updates to Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count. So with that context, moving on to our full-year guidance. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full-year operational sales and EPS guidance, despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule. Specifically the lost income related to the approximate 10% non-controlling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in process research and development cost related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8% or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at $1.10. The Euro spot rate as of mid-last week remains at $1.10. However, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies such as the Won and the Yen. As such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5%, compared to 2022 with a midpoint of $99.3 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L, we now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company's 10.4% non-controlling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense, we now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of a $150 million to $250 million, due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation. And finally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. Constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and healthcare staffing levels in the back half of the year with normal seasonality. We expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution recently launched products and improvement in supply. Headwinds from volume based procurement in China, as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia are expected to be higher in the second-half than the first-half of the year. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. We expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year slightly higher than the first-half. When modeling consumer health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year. Given the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near and long-term value. Beyond the separation, in the near-term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech with better commercial execution and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there are still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT MICRO Catheter in the U.S. during the second-half of this year. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution, recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year. And in Vision, we are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations such as ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day multifocal, which is driving Johnson & Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market. We look forward to continued growth from this and other recent Vision launches. Related to our pharmaceutical business, we are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets, including on the regulatory front there is expected approval of [daratumumab] (ph) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Clinically, we expect a Phase 3 data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in front line non-small cell lung cancer with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting. Phase 1 data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Phase 2 data for Nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. A couple of other items to highlight. In case you missed them, we recently published our Health For Humanity report our U.S. Pharmaceutical pricing transparency report and our U.S. patent table, all of which can be found on our website. Also, a reminder that we will be hosting an enterprise business review featuring both Pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 5th. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first-half of the year both financially and operationally and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second-half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Erik Haas. Yes, Larry, maybe I might just add to Joaquin's comments. The only thing that is limiting the growth, I would say, in the back half of the year is China volume-based pricing, as well as some international sanctions in Russia, but those are already incorporated into our outlook for the balance of 2023. So we feel we have those well in hand. If there's a little bit of abatement on either of those fronts, it portends well for the future. Thanks for the questions, Vamil. I'll start with STELARA and then see if Erik can add anything from a legal perspective, and then we'll hand it over to Joaquin for your question on the MARIPOSA study. With respect to STELARA this year, there won't be a significant impact. As you can imagine, most of that business was contracted for the full-year about this time last year. So there really wasn't any material impact. And our current assumption based on some of the agreements you read about similar to what we've said previously is that we wouldn't expect anything before January 1, 2025. I don't know, Erik, from a legal perspective, anything to add? And Joanne, with respect to your second question and completing the Consumer Health separation, our capital allocation priorities aren't changing. So we're going to continue to invest organically in our own pipeline. You saw that we pretty much have kept our percent to sales, which is -- leads across industries as a top 10 investor in R&D on an annual basis. We prioritize that. We realize that, that is underpinning our future success. As we have demonstrated, the dividends and the share repurchases that we've done this year has already returned a significant amount back to shareholders. And then we'll always be on the hunt for real good strategic opportunities that fit with either the clinical or science expertise we have or commercial capabilities that we can offer that drive more value out of a potential asset in our hands than where it currently resides. So we are looking feverishly as we always do across both MedTech and Pharm. And Terence, thanks for the question regarding margins. And specifically, I think you're getting at the heart of the potential deleverage that could occur with the separation once Kenvue is on its own entirely. You may recall a couple of quarters ago on one of these calls, we said that there was potentially $500 million to $750 million of deleverage in SG&A. We embarked on an initiative, and I guess the benchmarks would suggest companies usually take about two to three years to get those costs out of their system. Last summer, we really embarked on a project to eliminate those costs in a much faster cadence. And I would say of that $500 million to $750 million, there's a small fraction that may remain, and we're still working to eliminate that. So you should expect as you're modeling no deleveraging or very, very little deleveraging from the Kenvue separation. Yes. Good to speak with you Danielle. And I know you directed the question to me, and I'll answer with one word. I would say our appetite is pretty voracious at this point. But I'll leave it to Joaquin with respect to the size of the deals. I don't think it -- unequivocally doesn't change, whether it's big or small, it has to be a really good strategic fit utilizing the expertise and capabilities that we have and has to provide financial value. Joaquin, maybe you want to comment on any specific areas that [Indiscernible]?"

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. On Tuesday, July 18th in the case of Valadez v Johnson & Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on this talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder. Without the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with a decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence in over 40-years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc. The verdict award will not be paid, while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on a -- our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner. Looking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy re-filing by LTL, the bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by August 2nd the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed, reorganization plan and voting procedures process, and the path forward is scheduled for August 22nd. As we previously stated, Johnson & Johnson stands by its physician that is talcum powder products are safe as confirmed through decades of numerous independent scientific tests and studies. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jess. Larry, hi it's Erik. Thanks for the question. If Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy, we will be back in the tort system, and in that scenario we intend to fight the claims aggressively. And indeed, based upon the indicated decades of scientific support for the safety of our talc products, the fact that our talc products do not contain asbestos and the fact that our talc products do not cause cancer, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to prevail in the vast majority of claims as we have done in the past in the tort system. Yes. Thanks, Joe. From a litigation perspective, I could say that no other biosimilar is better positioned in our view than Amgen or Alvotech would be. So we would not anticipate any other biosimilar having the opportunity or ability to enter the market before those two. Turning to the question with respect to the number of claimants. Good and important question. The most recent update comes from the hearing on the motions to dismiss that finished on June 30th. And I would refer you to the post-trial findings of fact and conclusions in law that were filed last night that really detailed the evidentiary record that was elicited during the hearing. Based upon that testimony that was elicited and the evidence that went in, we are now looking at approximately 60,000 claimants in support or lawyers who represent 60,000 claimants in support of the plan and lawyers who represent about 40,000 claimants in opposition. So the numbers right now show that the vast majority of claimants support the proposed plan. Based upon the testimony during that hearing from the lawyers that support those claimants, we are confident that, that support will not waver. And we do anticipate that additional support will be coming forward. And with respect to the talc suits, we don't anticipate additional individual actions to go up for it outside the bankruptcy. Judge Kaplan lifted the stay only with respect to that one particular case, the Valdez case. Indeed, subsequent to that, he denied a request from the same counsel to lift the stay on another case. So currently, I would not anticipate any other case to go forward in advance of a ruling on the motion to dismiss."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. This was a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson with market leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical, our MedTech pipelines and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call. We're excited about entering a new era for Johnson & Johnson one built around science, innovation and technology and strategically focused on pharmaceutical and MedTech, while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today's call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results, as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near and long-term future performance. Starting with MedTech, for the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition. On a pro forma basis using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working. Q2 highlights in Electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest Ablation Catheter for Atrial Fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86%, as well as achieving shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month, we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfiRE study evaluates our dual energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source whether radio frequency or pulsed field based on patient needs. The Abiomed integration continued to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's public reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations. We anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multiyear growth platform for Johnson & Johnson. In orthopedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution is poised for further acceleration, having recently received CE and CA Mark international approvals. In Surgery, we are pleased with our progression on Ottava, our next generation soft tissue surgical robotic system, and we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In Vision, we recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX and TECNIS Eyhance and we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision. Now turning to pharmaceuticals. In the second quarter of the year, we delivered above market operational growth of 6.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year-on-year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. These new launches along with SPRAVATO are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target. We also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I'm particularly excited by include: first, the receipt of fast track designation from the U.S. FDA for all three prospective indications for Milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options, due to bleeding risk. Second, the recent submission of a supplemental BLA for CARVYKTI to the FDA and European Commission supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association meeting. And finally, we announced positive top line results from the Phase 3 PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. This is the first of several ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies to read out for RYBREVANT based regimens in EGFR mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the Phase 2 study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our Novel Oral IL23 Receptor Antagonist Peptide in Psoriasis. The finding suggests that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL23 mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into Phase 3 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and initiating a Phase 2b in ulcerative colitis and will continue to assess additional opportunities. We are very excited about the potential of this asset and believe it represents $1 billion plus commercial opportunity. We also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including STELARA. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our STELARA IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the U.S. on January 1, 2025 and Alvotech to launch in the U.S. on February 21, 2025. In all, our pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results. Our pipeline is progressing well and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 sales target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a two sector Johnson & Johnson with a higher growth profile. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail. Jess? Thank you, Larry, and thank you for complimenting us on the results on the first quarter and also on the MedTech ones. When it comes to the MedTech results, the growth in the first-half of the year was north of 8%. So this is a continuation of the sustained improvement in our performance that we have had in the last couple of years in which we have grown at or above our competitive composite. When we think about the dynamics that are driving our growth, which are multiple. One is the recovery in the overall market procedures, which is helping our improved commercial execution and very especially the cadence and flow of new product launches that we are having in the market. We see our trajectory in MedTech in the first-half of the year continuing in the second-half of the year. So we expect a similar trajectory for MedTech in the second-half of the year. Thank you. And with respect to MARIPOSA, nothing has changed. We -- this is an event-driven study with a final analysis expected as we said by the end of 2023 with a potential to be presented at a major medical meeting in 2023. We remain excited about the potential of RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib to become a new standard-of-care in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. And we are looking forward to be able to present these results in due time in a medical meeting potentially this year. So as I commented in the earlier question, we are pleased with the strength of our MedTech business in the first-half of the year with 8% growth. We -- this is driven by market growth, which we believe it's also slightly elevated this year due to the clearing of the COVID-19 backlog. And at the same time, as I commented to our improved commercial execution and the introduction of new products. Of note, of our $12 billion platforms in MedTech, all of them have grown during the first-half of the year. And we are being quite successful in introducing some important new products in all segments of our business. For example, if I start with electrophysiology, that grew north of 25% in the quarter. We have introduced a new mapping catheter OCTARAY and also a new treatment catheter QDOT, which, as you know, Joanne, we presented results about QDOT. So we increased efficacy and procedure efficiency, too. If we move into Vision, we are in the middle of the launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX, which is doing well and also the launch of our TECNIS Eyhance, the first mono-focal intraocular lens, which is progressing also very well. Moving into Orthopaedics. The good news is that we have received CE Mark and CA Mark for our Robotic-Assisted System VELYS. And we continue to have an enhanced portfolio of knees and hips with our Cementless knees, the Medial Stabilized and in the area of hips with hip navigation and the recent addition of CUPTIMIZE and we see our market position there also progressing. And moving forward, we will continue to see good evolution also in Orthopaedics. Finally, in Surgery, we continue to enhance our endocutter and our energy portfolio with the launch of ENSEAL jaw curved and also with the launch of ECHELON 3000 in the stapler side. So overall, good reception of our new products. That portend well for a continuation of growth, as I said before, in the second half of the year. And we look forward also to the different readouts of our PFA pipeline, which as we have announced, we have completed the enrollment of our dual energy catheter, which is going to be offering the physicians the comfort of a catheter that is the most well used with the option of having both radio frequency and PFA to adapt to every patient anatomy. And then on the robotic side, we will provide you more updates on our progress on OTTAVA, our soft tissue robotics system, before the end of the year as we committed. And we have also good news on our Monarch system that has already started with the first patient treated in removal of kidney stone. So overall, good progress during the year. Clearly, our MedTech business is doing well, delivering competitive growth. And we have good news in innovation as the year moves forward. Thank you, Chris. And let me start with your first question. We have always been confident on the fact that we will reach our $57 billion target by 2025 as we announced back in 2021. And certainly, what we are seeing now increases and reinforces and enhances our confidence. On one hand, you're seeing the progression of our pharmaceutical portfolio and our existing products with excellent results in DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA, also in our pulmonary hypertension franchise and in our long-acting injectable antipsychotic franchise, which are key products in this period. We are very pleased with the trajectory of our new product launches, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and SPRAVATO. If I focus on CARVYKTI, you see a clear improvement quarter-over-quarter in CARVYKTI, which reflects improvements in supply. In TECVAYLI, you see also a clear improvement of note. When we look at the TECVAYLI launch, align data with DARZALEX in the addressable patient population. TECVAYLI it's having a faster introduction. And finally, SPRAVATO, which is doing well. And now we see SPRAVATO as a $1 billion plus product, and you're seeing the results this quarter also reaching close to $170 million. If we look at our pipeline and the products of the pipeline that are going to impacting this period, we are expecting the PDUFA date of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody, which is going to give another option in the treatment of multiple myeloma. And we continue to progress and execute well in some of the key products in our pipeline. I commented on RYBREVANT and the combination of Lazertinib, as you know. We received fast track destination for the three key indications of milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant that we are working in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We presented very positive data about TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in meeting in the American Urological Association. And we also -- when it comes to CARVYKTI, we were very pleased to show the data on CARTITUDE-4. We are filing the BLA now, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we are expecting to show you some data on nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. We also have already presented in hemolytic disease of the features of the new wall. So in every angle of the products that we highlighted as the core products of our pipeline, we are executing well. Plus we recently presented in the World Congress of Dermatology our data in our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide, which show great efficacy in psoriasis. And we have announced plans to continue developing into psoriasis and also a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis. So overall, when I look at the picture for 2025, we have increased confidence based on our portfolio, in our new product launches and how we are executing on our pipeline. But now I would like to look even beyond \u201825 if you allow me, Chris, because 2025 is very close. It's only three years from now. So what I think is what you are seeing with this renewal of our portfolio is a very strong position for Johnson & Johnson in Pharmaceuticals beyond 2025. And that's something that we need to highlight, and I think it's important for everybody to recognize. This is going to put us in a great position beyond 2025. So let me start with the MARIPOSA. No, I mean, we are -- as we communicated, we are moving into a final analysis by the end of the year, potentially presenting the data at the end of the year. Yes. So thank you for the question. And the answer is nothing prevents us from doing that. As a matter of fact, our aspiration in myeloma is that with the portfolio that we have today with DARZALEX, TECVAYLI, talquetamab and CARVYKTI, we would be in a position to have three out of every four patients starting in Janssen containing regimen by the end of this decade. So that's our aspiration in myeloma. Our aspiration is that there is a Janssen regimen for every line of therapy and a Janssen treatment for every patient irrespective of their characteristics. And that's the way we are planning our development. Certainly, DARZALEX being a backbone of therapy, first line and also in combination with multiple agents and then sequencing into CARVYKTI and talquetamab and TECVAYLI, which we are studying in combination with DARZALEX and also in combination among each other and sequencing among them. So ultimately, our goal when it comes to multiple myeloma is to be able to sequence our medicines, combine them in a way that we are changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And that is a big, big, big plus in our portfolio. And as I have commented often, multiple myeloma is the core of our Pharmaceutical franchise and the number one growth driver that is going to be for 2025 and beyond. There's more factors that give us optimism about the business potential of this area is that as we combine and as we seek those treatments, the treatment duration itself is going to be significantly increased. So we overall foresee great patient and growth opportunity as we look to combine all these modalities, as I said, in order to be able to convert multiple myeloma into a chronic disease. Yes. Thank you, Danielle. And before I go there, let me say that the Abiomed integration is progressing really well. The growth of Abiomed, it's been 20% on the quarter and we continue to move forward with the enrollment in the key PMA studies, PROTECT and STEMI DTU as well as the Impella ECP. So everything is moving well according to plan in the Abiomed integration. And we are increasingly convinced that this is going to be a key component of our MedTech strategy in becoming a leader in heart recovery. So when it comes to M&A, look, we continue to look for opportunities. And our number one criteria in looking for opportunities is the medical innovation, how they improve patient care, how do we see the science behind the product. So we are agnostic in that sense to MedTech and Pharmaceuticals. It's all about identifying areas that are going to have a significant impact in patient care. When it comes to MedTech, certainly, as we have commented, we are continuing to look forward for opportunities to grow into areas that are close to where we are today. Vision, cardiovascular obviously, surgery too and also opportunities in certain high-growth segments of Orthopaedics. And we normally will continue to look for these opportunities, trying to have a good return on capital, as well as things that are close to our existing expertise. When it comes to Pharma, our history in tuck-ins, in license and collaboration has been very successful. As a matter of fact, external innovation represents about 50% of our pipeline. And while we will continue to look for opportunities like we have done now with Cellular Biomedicines and the agreement that we have too in CAR-T, we are not averse to other transactions of larger size. Evidently both in MedTech and in pharma, we are very disciplined with our capital allocation. And all our transactions will have to clear certain financial milestones for us to be able to move on. But M&A and also licensing acquisition collaborations remains a key factor in our growth moving forward. Yes. So let me start with the IRA. Obviously, we remain very concerned about the government price-setting environment that the IRA creates, which we believe creates a significant disincentive to innovation without addressing the core problem, which is patient access. So it is a significant concern for us. And that's one of the reasons, as we commented earlier, that we have filed a lawsuit versus the IRA. So that's important for us. Then when it comes to the actual business impact, I think it's still early to be able to calculate it, given the fact that many of the rules and procedures are still in flux. So it would be too much to be able to try to anticipate that. In our case, when we look at Johnson & Johnson, relatively speaking towards the industry based on our diversification between MedTech and Pharma and also the diversification of our Pharma portfolio, we feel that we are well positioned competitively to continue to grow way beyond the second-half of this decade. So we remain concerned. But at the same time, we think we are prepared to be able to manage successfully any situation coming from that relative to other industry players. The second question was about CARVYKTI. As I commented earlier, we are working to improve CARVYKTI supply, which is very important. You've seen that improvement in our sales in the second quarter. We are working in different ways. One is we are increasing capacity. We have internalized the production of lentivirus now. And also, we are in the process of increasing the number of slots internally. And also, we have reached agreements with other companies like Novartis to continue to increase capacity. So we are going to be in the trajectory of increasing capacity gradually in order to be able to eventually meet the demand that exists in CARVYKTI. As far as reaching to other patient populations, the CARVYKTI 4, it's already been filed. And it's moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy, and we are also working in first line with CARVYKTI 5 and CARVYKTI -- excuse me, with CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6. So we are clearly intending to move CARVYKTI through CARTITUDE-4, CARTITUDE-5, and CARTITUDE-6 into earlier lines of therapy. And we are increasingly convinced of the potential of CARVYKTI to be one of our more than $5 billion assets that we announced back in 2021. Thank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining this call today. I'm extremely proud of the performance that we have achieved in the first-half of 2023. We are entering the back half of the year from a position of strength with numerous catalysts, including the fact that we are going to be a two-sector company focused on Pharmaceutical and MedTech recent development and innovation. We look forward to having future engagements with you to update you on our continued progress. Thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of your day."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJessica Moore: Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 first quarter business results and full year financial outlook. Joining me on today's call are Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech. Unfortunately, Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals is not feeling well and is unable to join us today. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.6% versus the first quarter of 2022. Operational sales, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9% as currency had a negative impact of 3.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.7%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales increased 1.8%. Operational sales outside the U.S. increased 8.3% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 6.5 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, 7.4% in the U.S. and 7.9% outside the U.S. with all three segments growing sequentially over the fourth quarter. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net loss was $68 million and basic loss per share was $0.03 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 one-year ago primarily driven by the $6.9 billion charge related to the Talc Settlement proposal. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, representing a decrease of 0.9% and an increase of 0.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2022 and therefore, exclude the impact currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.9 billion increased 7.4% with an increase of 11.4% in the U.S. and an increase of 4.4% outside the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11.3% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 11.3%. Results were primarily driven by global strategic price increases across all franchises. Volume growth in OTC was due to an exceptionally strong cough, cold and flu season most pronounced in Europe, coupled with one-time retailer restocking primarily in the U.S. related to low inventory levels due to tripledemic demand. Skin Health/Beauty delivered double-digit growth driven by price actions, lapping prior year supply constraints and current quarter restocking as well as strong NEUTROGENA and AVEENO e-commerce and club channel performance and new product innovations. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.4 billion increased 4.2% with growth of 5.9% in the U.S. and 2.4% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 7.2% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 8.6%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales increased 4.9%, U.S. operational sales increased 7.1%, and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 2.4%. Pharmaceutical growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with eight assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 25.7% and 40.3%, respectively. STELARA grew 9.6% driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 2.2 points and 4.8 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and price. TREMFYA grew 11% driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 0.9 points and 2.1 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Turning to newly launched products. We are excited to disclose CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO sales for the first-time this quarter. We continue to make progress on our thoughtful and phased launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. Also, we are encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. This sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased by 7.3% with growth of 16.6% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.6% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 6.2%. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6.4%. Sales in the first quarter accelerated sequentially from Q4 for all four MedTech businesses, driven by global procedure growth, continued uptake of recently launched products, and commercial execution. As anticipated, in China, procedure volumes improved as the quarter progressed. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement in China as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 41.9%, which includes $324 million related to Abiomed. We are excited about the progress of the integration to which Joe will provide additional context. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, this franchise delivered another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 12.3%. As we continue to increase our reporting transparency, beginning this quarter, we are providing visibility to electrophysiology sales. Electrophysiology continued to deliver double-digit sales growth in all regions with the exception of Asia-Pacific, which reflects impacts related to volume-based procurement in China. Orthopaedics operational growth of 5.1% reflects the strong procedure recovery and success of recently launched products especially digital and enabling technologies driving pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume based procurement in China, primarily in hips and spine. Global growth of 9.3% in contact lens and other reflects continued penetration of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and strategic price actions. Growth in contact lens and U.S. surgical vision was tempered by continued supply challenges. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs in the Pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation and acquisition-related items in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 60 basis points driven by proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 2.9% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was an expense of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $100 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in expense was the result of the $6.9 billion charge related to the Talc Settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023 as previously disclosed. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 90.8% versus 12.2% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the $6.9 billion accrual for the Talc Settlement proposal. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 13.3% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at the adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 35.1% to 34.2%. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 44.1% to 43.2% driven primarily by mix, partially offset by proactive management of costs. MedTech margins remained flat at 27% driven primarily by inflationary impacts, offset by proactive management of costs. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 22.1% to 22.3% driven primarily by strategic price actions, partially offset by input cost inflation. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2023 results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining today's call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operational performance across our business. The results reflect the strength and versatility of Johnson & Johnson and our commitment to improving health care outcomes around the world. 2023 has many important catalysts that can drive meaningful near- and long-term value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders. We remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business, Kenvue, which will position both companies to be more agile, focused and competitive. We are also expecting a number of pipeline advancements that will provide increased confidence in our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered a strong first quarter. Growth from our Pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by key assets in our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as uptake from new launches such as SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. 2023 is an important year of scientific innovation for our Pharmaceutical business. And in Q1, we announced that CARVYKTI, our BCMA cell therapy, met its primary endpoint in the CARTITUDE-4 study, a Phase 3 trial in multiple myeloma patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. We look forward to presenting these results in an upcoming major medical meeting. Additionally, our partners at Protagonist Therapeutics announced positive top line results from the Phase 2b FRONTIER 1 study of our Oral IL-23 in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We look forward to sharing this data and future development plans at an upcoming medical meeting. Finally, as we continually review our portfolio to prioritize the most transformational assets for ongoing investment and an assessment of the RSV vaccine landscape, the company made the decision to discontinue its investigational RSV adult vaccine program. This decision is part of a broader effort to make strategic choices for our pipeline and R&D investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect important data from key pipeline assets such as Nipocalimab and TREMFYA as well as the potential approval of Talquetamab. Importantly, I want to mention two additional highlights. First, the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer remains on track with the potential for final analysis later this year. We are also excited to present data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in muscle invasive bladder cancer at the American Urological Association's Annual Meeting this month, which demonstrated a promising complete response and safety profile. Regarding our Pharmaceutical business, I'd like to reiterate some comments I recently made at the Cowen Investor Conference in March related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the impact on the 2025 Pharmaceutical sales goal the team put forth during the 2021 Investor Day. While we don't speculate on currency, based on the current rates, the 2025 sales target of $60 billion is approximately $57 billion on a constant currency basis. In 2022 alone, FX had a negative impact of roughly $3 billion in Pharmaceuticals. While that is the math qualitatively since 2021, a number of things have changed in our portfolio. On the plus side, we've seen acceleration of some current and potential upcoming launches like TECVAYLI and Talquetamab. But (ph) to be balanced, we've also experienced competitive pressure on IMBRUVICA above what was anticipated in 2021. So many push and pulls, but we are striving to attain our operational goals. We are confident in our ability to exceed 2025 estimates The Street has out there today of approximately $54 billion. MedTech delivered a strong quarter of sales growth. We continued to advance key pipeline programs. For example, within our electrophysiology business, we reached a few milestones this quarter related to our pulse field ablation pipeline programs, including the European clinical study inspIRE, which achieved early success by meeting both primary safety and efficacy endpoints. Additionally, we announced completion of the first procedures in the European SmartfIRE clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our investigational dual energy catheter, which combines both pulse field and radio frequency ablation capabilities. As you know, we continue to prioritize investment in high growth areas, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Abiomed, which closed this past December. With Abiomed, MedTech now has 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. While it is still early days, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Abiomed. Patient utilization of Abiomed technologies grew mid to high-teens in both Europe and the United States and over 30% in Japan. We continue to see strong adoption of newer technologies, such as Impella 5.5 and we achieved record quarterly enrollment in both the STEMI-DTU and PROTECT IV pivotal trials as we continue to advance efforts in pursuit of Class I guidelines. For perspective, operational sales growth compared to the same quarter last year reported by Abiomed as a standalone company was 22%. In Orthopaedics, just this month, we obtained CE Mark for the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution, positioning us to expand our international footprint with this differentiated solution in total knee. Finally, the MedTech team is excited by the progress being made in regards to the Ottava general surgery robotic solution, and we remain on track to share more information in the second half of this year. Our Consumer Health business delivered double-digit first quarter sales growth driven by strategic price actions, strong demand and some stock replenishment. We remain on track to complete the separation of this business in 2023, assuming accommodative market conditions. Since the start of the year, we have been operating our Consumer Health business as a company within a company and continue to update our Form S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the opportunity to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the separation. Standup cost and stranded costs remain consistent with what we have stated previously with an active program well underway to reduce the stranded costs. Turning to notable enterprise events. I'd like to briefly touch on LTL's re-filing for bankruptcy on April 4. Neither LTL's original filing nor this re-filing is an acknowledgment of wrongdoing nor an indication that the company has changed its long-standing position that its talcum powder products are safe. Our goal continues to be for an equitable and efficient resolution of the cosmetic talc litigation against the company, and we believe this refiling represents progress towards that goal. As a reminder, LTL's bankruptcy filing will not have an impact upon the Kenvue separation, and the talc liabilities in the United States and Canada will remain with Johnson & Johnson. As part of the re-filing, we have proposed a reorganization plan that had significant support from Claimants and includes a payment of $8.9 billion in present value over a 25-year period. LTL will continue to work through the process set forth by the bankruptcy court and expects to present the reorganization plan to the court in mid-May. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And in 2022, we successfully executed against all pillars. R&D investment remains our number one priority and driver of long-term growth and value creation. We know the value our investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.3% increase, marking our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic business development opportunities that enable Johnson & Johnson to create value for patients, customers and shareholders. Our final priority is share repurchase programs when appropriate. In fact, this past quarter, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program announced late last year. We are confident in our strong financial position, including our AAA-rated balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital across all strategic priorities. We believe this strength differentiates Johnson & Johnson and enables us to pull the appropriate levers to set us up for long-term success. Moving on to our full year 2023 guidance for the enterprise. Based on our strong start to the year, we are pleased to raise our guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 up 1 percentage point in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, or up $1 billion in a range of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth up 1 percentage point in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at 1.08. The euro spot rate as of late last week was 1.10. We continue to estimate there would be minimal impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year as the dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies. We are maintaining the guidance we provided in January for our adjusted pre-tax operating margin, other income and expense, interest expense and tax rate. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 per share and tightening the range to $10.50 to $10.60, or $10.55 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, or 4% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. This favorable currency impact, coupled with our strong operational outlook, results in an increase to our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year by $0.10 per share and tightening the range to $10.60 to $10.70, or $10.65 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4.5% to 5.5%, or 5% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. In Pharmaceuticals, we maintain our expectation of delivering above market growth in 2023 driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. This growth considers the potential composition of matter patent expiry of STELARA, which we currently assume will occur in late 2023 in the United States. Further, we continue to expect 2023 impact from other post-LOE products, including REMICADE, ZYTIGA and XEPLION as well as increased austerity measures across Europe. Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we do not anticipate material sales beyond that which were recorded in the first quarter as our contractual commitments are complete. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by increased procedures and commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate relatively stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels for the remainder of the year with normal seasonality. Regarding quarterly phasing, given the strength of our first quarter results, we now expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. When modeling Consumer Health growth rates in 2023, it is important to take into consideration prior year comparisons as well as the robust cough, cold and flu season and the one-time restocking that occurred in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first half of 2022 was impacted by supply constraints. A few brief announcements before we take your questions. Continuing our efforts to increase our transparency and assist with your modeling, we are planning to post a patent table, including U.S. pharmaceutical patents, to our investor website in the quarter. In addition, please mark your calendars for December 5, as we will be hosting an enterprise business review at the New York Stock Exchange focused on the new Johnson & Johnson, highlighting both our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. We will provide additional details about the event in the coming months. Before we turn to your questions, let me state how proud we are regarding our team's continued hard work and unwavering commitment. Our sights are set on the future, focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson. We are confident that our current plans position us for near-term success, long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. I'll now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thank you so much. Just maybe a two-parter on the pharma side. First, on the $57 billion target for pharma, I think your comments are very clear in terms of your confidence of exceeding consensus of $54 billion. Are you still confident though in that $57 billion target as we think about kind of the pushes and pulls that you just outlined there? And then maybe just a specific question on RYBREVANT. Just want to make sure the comments correctly there. I think you mentioned there's a final analysis of MARIPOSA later this year. Does that mean the interim has passed at this point? And maybe just put some context of what you think you need to show in that study to dislodge share from TAGRISSO. Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Hey. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the questions. So first, with respect the $57 billion. I wanted to make sure that I was clear on the record since I had the opportunity to do that about a month ago that everybody understood the message around the math component of it. We feel very good about our pipeline. We continue to work towards some really good data that came out this quarter around multiple myeloma, MARIPOSA, which we'll talk about in a minute. We continue to see some uptake of some of our newer products and the goal is still that for us. But you'll have a much better and much more informed and probably timely update once we hit the December 5 meeting at the New York Stock Exchange, so stay posted on that. What I do feel comfortable though is that we're moving certainly in the right direction. I wanted to take out the unclarity that maybe was created by currency and the dramatic movements that occurred over the last 18 months. So for MARIPOSA, I would say the study of RYBREVANT and Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer versus TAGRISSO remains very much on track. It's an event-driven trial. So there's the potential for final analysis later this year, which is actually two quarters ahead than what we had originally expected, was originally expected to be second quarter of 2024. The accrual to the study we can say is very rapid as there was tremendous interest. And the interim analysis was specified in the protocol with a significantly limited follow-up and supported the continuation of the study. We were blinded to that interim analysis. And as far as what we need to show, I think we\u2019re just going to let the science dictate, let the trial results come out. But we feel pretty comfortable where we\u2019re at now and pleased with how quickly the trial enrolled.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatt Miksic: Great. Thanks so much. I have, if I could, just one question on knees and a quick follow-up, kind of a general strategy question on STELARA and pharma if I could. So on knees in the U.S., obviously, very strong growth. And just wondering if you could, and I think expectations have been strong throughout Q1. I just was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color as to what's driving that strength? How much of that is maybe the robot? How much of that is on other product launches and then one quick follow-up on pharma, if I may.\nAshley McEvoy: Matt, thank you for the question. And before I turn it to Joe on STELARA, it's really nice to see 12% growth in the U.S. for knees. We haven't seen that in a while. But before I get into specifically knees, maybe just a quick frame on like the quarter. Obviously, first, the industry I think continues to remain strong and growing. Procedures are well in recovery mode. It's awesome to see an 11% operational performance and 6.4 adjusted ops for the first quarter. It was our first quarter with Abiomed. So if you look at them on like-for-like periods, it's a standalone of 22% growth. But I think when I look at all of the math, if you will, for the quarter, what I'm most pleased about is really the balanced growth. And we had our BWI business up 13%. Our global vision, up 8%. And our U.S. business, the largest market, growing north of 8% really fueled by ortho performance, up 6% as well as surgery up 6%. And you hear us talk about this 12 $1 billion platform, but six of those grew double-digit in the United States in the quarter. EMEA was strong, and Asia was a little bit softer again by China. Obviously, Jan and Feb was a bit softer. We were encouraged with March procedures recovered in March. But I would call it three specific innovations, and then I'll go deeper into knees. One is our pulse field ablation. So we're very pleased with the data that an AFib that it's promising. We have four clinical trials ongoing. Two out of the four, we've completed enrollment, and we shared the data from the INSPIRE trial where we met the primary endpoint for both safety and efficacy. Our Abiomed, as we've talked about we're about 90 days in. They continue to advance the innovation pipeline. They're in clinic in four clinical trials to expand new products and to expand indications to get designation. And last, I would say, Matt, we are in all things robotics. So let's talk about VELYS. We just received CE Mark positioning it for expansion to more global markets. Right now, we're in five. But I'm pleased to say that it's now the fastest growing knee robotic system in the United States. We've completed over 20,000 procedures. And we're taking a systems approach to our business in hips to shoulders and the spine. Our Monarch platform is the first and only multispecialty flexible robotics solution with FDA clearance in bronchoscopy as well as endo-urology. We've completed 25,000 procedures and are in clinic right now combining the Monarch Endoluminal navigation with ablation treatment technology on new wave. And just recently, in February, we were -- the first patient received robotic-assisted removal of kidney stone. We're trying to get a higher kidney stone clearance rate than the standard of care. And last, as we talked about our team in Ottava is really progressing significantly, really looking forward to a back half of the year update with the team. So VELYS is really a combination of having access to cementless, both on fixed bearing and rotating platform, revision, our new introduction of the medial stabilized knees and most importantly, not just coupled with the robotic system, VELYS, but coupled with the most modern knee implant in the world. Thank you.\nMatt Miksic: Well, that was a fantastic overview. Thanks for that and congrats on all the innovation and the significant change in momentum across all those businesses. Just a quick question, I guess, I had on pharma was -- I mean, it's a big question, and I think it's on a lot of investors' minds is if we turn into the end of the year and you think about STELARA, and you think about sort of the actions that you expect to take whether organic, the pipeline that you have and as it comes through, and some of these new products launch and get bigger. And then strategic, if you could maybe give a sense of what are your goals over the next 12 months, 18 months as you sort of whether that LOE and what sort of mix of action should we expect you to take to kind of manage through that? Thanks.\nJoe Wolk: Sure. Thanks, Matt for the question. A lot to maybe unpack possibly there. But let me first start with our base assumption, the guidance, which has the underlying assumption that in the U.S., STELARA will lose exclusivity in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year and that's kind of the assumption that we're going on. What I would say is that's somewhat fluid. At this point, there are currently no biosimilars approved. In terms of our planning, we are expecting -- despite learning a lot over the last few years with REMICADE, we're expecting a steeper erosion curve than what was experienced there because this is a self-administered subcutaneous product. There will be multiple competitors on the market at some point, and they may have the affordability of interchangeability. But we may remain committed to growing through the patent exploration. One of the, the great things about our portfolio, whether we're talking within Pharmaceuticals or across the broader businesses, we've got 30 products or platforms that generate over $1 billion in annual revenue. So we're not dependent on one product the way others may have. In terms of unpacking your question maybe a little bit further, I got the sense you were heading towards M&A. Certainly, we always remain vigilant and look at a number of opportunities, making sure there's a strategic fit before we act. If there's a strategic fit, then we're going to look to deploy capital in the way that returns to shareholders to compensate them, quite frankly for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. But we're not going to do anything out of desperation based on the breadth of our product portfolio. We are lucky in that we've got a strong balance sheet to do whatever we'd like, but we want to make sure it makes good strategic and financial sense. So that's probably the best way to answer that. I know Jennifer and the team are very committed to growing through the loss of STELARA whenever that may occur. And the pipeline data that we\u2019re generating now as well as really the early success we\u2019re having in some of these newer products, I think, positions us well to meet those goals.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe a two-part one for me as well. Thanks for the update on the talc litigation, Joe. I was just wondering if you could comment at all about any additional progress towards that 75% threshold, specifically the denominator and kind of where that's shaking out? And then on the Oral IL-23 program there, just wondering if you can confirm if you're going to advance into Phase 3 and where that drug might be positioned ultimately in the treatment paradigm based on the data you guys have seen thus far. Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Great. Thanks for the question, Terence. Let me start with the second one first with respect to the Oral IL-23, where our partners at Protagonist announced some, for very encouraging data out of the Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 study. So we do plan to present data from various pre-clinical and clinical studies on this compound at medical conferences beginning in the second quarter of this year. We believe this could be very much an important and underappreciated asset within our immunology portfolio. With respect to the litigation, we thought that this could come up as a question. So we're very pleased to have Andrew White, our Assistant General Counsel, here with us today. But let me say a little maybe a couple of qualitative things from my seat, and then we can have Andrew either clean it up or give you some more specifics. But it is important to note that these cases and we stand by the safety of the product, there's decades of independent research conducted by reputable government agencies, patient advocacy groups as well as academic institutions that support the safety of cosmetic talc. Furthermore, it was only two years ago, [indiscernible] hearing where the judge really restricted the use of many of the claims, supposedly scientific claims that were being made by the plaintiff attorneys in this case and many pundits even classified it as junk (ph) signs at that point. Here, we have the support of 60,000 to 70,000 claimants that would vote for the proposal as it's currently presented. But curiously, we've got a small number of plaintiff's attorneys who don't even want to give their claimants, the right to vote. So we're simply asking that they get the right to vote. Now from my chair as CFO, it is unfortunate that we've got to put dollars towards, quite frankly, baseless scientific claims. However, litigation is inherently costly when it's protracted and it's also inherently uncertain. And when court (ph) proposal really aims to bring certainty in a very efficient manner for all really involved, something that would otherwise take probably decades to resolve. So let me turn it over to Andrew in terms of maybe any of the specifics that you can add.\nAndrew White: Yeah. Good morning, Terence. Thanks, Joe. As Joe mentioned, we are very confident in the position that we stand today in terms of support for the plan. We have well over 60,000 that have expressed a desire to vote for this plan. And the expectation is that we will move forward with a reorganization plan to present to the court within the next 30 days and hope to quickly move to a vote. And we believe once we put that plan out for a vote, we'll gain even more support from a small, but I would say, vocal minority of attorneys. So we believe we're going to reach that 75% threshold and look forward to getting that plan out to a vote.\nA \u2013 Joe Wolk: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, two for you on the guidance. I heard you on CNBC this morning, and you said you turned from cautious in January to optimistic now about 2023. So I was curious about two things. One, on the guidance you previously expected second half to be better than the first half in MedTech and Pharma because of the growth drivers you outlined on the Q4 call, so what changed there? Why do you expect growth to be more stable through the year? And second, Joe, on the margins. Q1 was up about 60 basis points year-over-year in Q1 on the operating margin, but you expect -- and you expect gross margins to improve through 2023 as inflation wanes. So why would the operating margin be flat for the full year? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJoe Wolk: Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Well, first, I do want to correct the record a little bit on you. Responsibly was in front of both cautious as well as optimistic. So we've moved from responsibly cautious to responsibly optimistic. Why do I say that? It's because we did see some dynamics within our P&L, the team's great ability to really manage our resources effectively with the backdrop of really a company separation that could lend itself to some stranded costs. We're managing those extremely well. There is still inflation within the P&L. I don't think we should say that it's now behind us. We have a good data point with respect to where we landed Q1. I'm very pleased with the first quarter results and the strength of that and why we've maybe moved from a little bit more of a consistent approach throughout the year versus a stronger second half from the first half is really around the first quarter results. So in terms of Pharmaceutical pricing, it was still unfavorable as you might expect with respect to Pharmaceutical, but not as unfavorable as we anticipated. And then maybe Ashley can talk here, too. When we came out in January, there was -- the pandemic was kind of full blown in the Asia Pacific region. And we did see a very positive data point in March with respect to China specifically. I don't know, Ashley, anything to add there?\nAshley McEvoy: Yeah. No, Larry, what I would share is, I would say that procedures are trending well above all pre-COVID levels. It was up until December with the exception of China. China in December, January and February were well below pre-COVID levels. In January trending like, down (ph) 50%. So I am encouraged to see in March that, they are back up. They are back up a little bit ahead of pre-COVID levels. And so that's why we're kind of rebalancing the year. I think that we're going to have more stability throughout the balance to go year versus earlier thinking that we would be having a stronger second half versus first half.\nJoe Wolk: Yeah. And Larry with respect to operating margins, it's still very early in the year. It's still only April. If we have the opportunity to manage these macroeconomic headwinds that we ended the year with and then maybe provide the flexibility for further investment for great opportunities down the road that fortify the future, we'll certainly look to do that. You guys know us well enough that if we don\u2019t find those meaningful opportunities, we\u2019ll probably have the opportunity to take up guidance down the road. But my first preference would be to deploy that in investment opportunities that secure both MedTech and Pharmaceuticals for the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So I had a Pharmaceutical question for you. You've built a really strong oncology franchise and what are some unique approaches you think you can take to create combos and regimens that might not be available to other companies? And are there any additional areas in oncology that you would like to be involved in that you are not now currently involved in? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Louise. So I think we're always looking at combinations. The one that's most prolific at this point now is certainly one for non-small cell lung cancer, which really impacts about 20% of lung cancer that's diagnosed today with a certain mutation. We're very much looking forward to the data that may read-out later this year with respect to that. In terms of new areas, I know that the teams are looking very much. I would say some of the new areas that we're coming into now would be some of the bispecific antibodies with respect to multiple myeloma rounding out that portfolio. We know how I want to say almost personalized that disease is and having multiple options for treatments and maybe even someday potentially cures certainly lends itself with the multiple options that we have. We're going to be focused on multiple myeloma, obviously, prostate cancer, lung cancer. We're very excited about some of the data that could read out on what I'll call the MedTech, Pharma combo of -- for bladder cancer and with the TARIS device with the drug eluting BALVERSA. So there's multiple plays within oncology, which is now our biggest franchise with immunology in terms of sales contribution to the pharmaceutical success.\nJessica Moore: The only aspect that I'd add to Louise is, as you know, our multiple myeloma platform is extremely strong. And we're looking at some multiple clinical trials about not cannibalizing those products, but rather looking at combination treatments as well as sequences of those products between TECVAYLI, DARZALEX, CARVYKTI and then hopefully our soon to be approved Talquetamab.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Had a question for Ashley just on the [indiscernible] PFA platform. I was hoping that just get an update on commercial time lines. Anything you can share just in terms of CE Mark and then FDA approvals. And then maybe digging a little bit deeper, just helping us understand. I mean, our expectation is that [indiscernible] will be third to market in the United States, but what percentage of [indiscernible] revenues are levered to the ablation catheter segment within the EP industry? And then what drives your optimism that [indiscernible] will maintain -- be able to maintain [indiscernible] position in the ablation catheter segment? Thanks for taking the questions.\nAshley McEvoy: Yeah. Thank you, Josh. Listen, it's a really important space. And we always say at J&J, we're always trying to intercept disease before it advances. And this is one example of managing atrial fibrillation, which is the leading cause of cardiac arrhythmia (ph) and unmanaged, that could lead to a stroke. So what gives us confidence that we can lead and compete and have a source of differentiation, I would say kind of the following. I'd say, one, we have a 20-year track record of being a world leader in cardiac ablation. We have 5,000 plus installed base. We do see the promise of PSA. We are actively engaged in four clinical trials. Two of those trials have completed enrollment. The European and INSPIRE as well as the U.S. We've shared data in February in the international AFib symposium that we met the primary endpoint. And I would tell you, our approach is really what's differentiated, Josh. So we're kind of leveraging a deep expertise and the insights into the various ablation strategies. So we have a portfolio of PFA catheters, which are fully integrated into the [indiscernible] system and it's powered by kind of our true pulse generator. So we really underscore the importance of how important mapping is and vision to know where operators are and what they're doing in the heart anatomy. And kind of the bottom line for us is, we actually think access to radio frequency, which has like 20-plus years of safety and efficacy coupled with the newer generation of PFA is really going to be the winning combo for electrophysiologists. It's really why we are in clinic right now with the dual energy solution because we think it could offer the relative safety of the PFA and really the proven durability of radio frequency. So we're not issuing specific timelines, but you can know that we've completed enrollment in two of those four clinical trials.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nGeoff Meacham: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I have two related ones in Pharma. So on IMBRUVICA, how do you guys view the impact from the indication withdrawal and is there a risk of other non-CLL indications like follicular being pulled? And then related to your hematology business, do you guys have a status update on CARVYKTI supply after or was this quarter a really good quarter? Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Geoff. So with respect to IMBRUVICA, I would say that we're not expecting any more withdrawals at this point. It is obviously based on our performance, encountering competitive pressures. But it's really the competition that's been the biggest driver in terms of the performance that we're not seeing there, quite frankly. But it's -- the withdrawal was a very small part of our business to begin with, but we don't anticipate other withdrawals at this point. With respect to your second question and supply on CARVYKTI, I would say that you probably did read the announcement recently that we did sign on for additional capacity to scale up some production and increase availability moving forward. The manufacturing is ramping up to supply markets. We have really tremendous demand given some of the data that supports this CARVYKTI, the CAR-T for Johnson & Johnson. And we\u2019re committed to doing everything we can to accelerate our manufacturing abilities to meet that demand. We work in our facility and again continues to progress. And it will serve as an important part of our supply chain network for not just this but other cell therapies in the future.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Geoff. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and it's good to be back talking to you all. Ashley, just a quick question for you on the Orthopaedics number. A very good quarter. I was just wondering, I know this is really hard to parse out, but what is -- from your sense, what does backlog work down versus real underlying growth and/or more specific to J&J share gain? Anything you can say on how to think about what's happening in the Orthopaedics market right now in the U.S.? Thanks so much.\nAshley McEvoy: No. Thank you, Danielle. It's great to hear your voice. Listen, it's really a combination of both. Procedures are accelerating, particularly like even as recently as March in China, as an example, U.S. working through some of the backlog. So I do think that the market is in our favor. But at the same time, I have to give huge acknowledgment to the Orthopaedics team, who has really built a very differentiated portfolio. And they are now participating in the fastest growing segments within the Orthopaedics category. So if the category is going three to four, they're competing in areas that are high-single digit. And what are those areas? It's all things robotics. It's around new sites of care like, ASCs. It's around extremities. I'm very pleased with our recent acquisition of [indiscernible], a foot and ankle. It's what we talked about around revision needs and cementless needs. Those are really the faster-growing segments in Orthopaedics, and we are well positioned to take advantage of that demand. Thank you for the question.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We have well over 60,000 that have expressed a desire to vote for this plan. And the expectation is that we will move forward with a reorganization plan to present to the court within the next 30 days and hope to quickly move to a vote. And we believe once we put that plan out for a vote, we'll gain even more support from a small, but I would say, vocal minority of attorneys. So we believe we're going to reach that 75% threshold and look forward to getting that plan out to a vote.\nA \u2013 Joe Wolk: Thank you, Andrew."

            "content": "Matt, thank you for the question. And before I turn it to Joe on STELARA, it's really nice to see 12% growth in the U.S. for knees. We haven't seen that in a while. But before I get into specifically knees, maybe just a quick frame on like the quarter. Obviously, first, the industry I think continues to remain strong and growing. Procedures are well in recovery mode. It's awesome to see an 11% operational performance and 6.4 adjusted ops for the first quarter. It was our first quarter with Abiomed. So if you look at them on like-for-like periods, it's a standalone of 22% growth. But I think when I look at all of the math, if you will, for the quarter, what I'm most pleased about is really the balanced growth. And we had our BWI business up 13%. Our global vision, up 8%. And our U.S. business, the largest market, growing north of 8% really fueled by ortho performance, up 6% as well as surgery up 6%. And you hear us talk about this 12 $1 billion platform, but six of those grew double-digit in the United States in the quarter. EMEA was strong, and Asia was a little bit softer again by China. Obviously, Jan and Feb was a bit softer. We were encouraged with March procedures recovered in March. But I would call it three specific innovations, and then I'll go deeper into knees. One is our pulse field ablation. So we're very pleased with the data that an AFib that it's promising. We have four clinical trials ongoing. Two out of the four, we've completed enrollment, and we shared the data from the INSPIRE trial where we met the primary endpoint for both safety and efficacy. Our Abiomed, as we've talked about we're about 90 days in. They continue to advance the innovation pipeline. They're in clinic in four clinical trials to expand new products and to expand indications to get designation. And last, I would say, Matt, we are in all things robotics. So let's talk about VELYS. We just received CE Mark positioning it for expansion to more global markets. Right now, we're in five. But I'm pleased to say that it's now the fastest growing knee robotic system in the United States. We've completed over 20,000 procedures. And we're taking a systems approach to our business in hips to shoulders and the spine. Our Monarch platform is the first and only multispecialty flexible robotics solution with FDA clearance in bronchoscopy as well as endo-urology. We've completed 25,000 procedures and are in clinic right now combining the Monarch Endoluminal navigation with ablation treatment technology on new wave. And just recently, in February, we were -- the first patient received robotic-assisted removal of kidney stone. We're trying to get a higher kidney stone clearance rate than the standard of care. And last, as we talked about our team in Ottava is really progressing significantly, really looking forward to a back half of the year update with the team. So VELYS is really a combination of having access to cementless, both on fixed bearing and rotating platform, revision, our new introduction of the medial stabilized knees and most importantly, not just coupled with the robotic system, VELYS, but coupled with the most modern knee implant in the world. Thank you. Yeah. No, Larry, what I would share is, I would say that procedures are trending well above all pre-COVID levels. It was up until December with the exception of China. China in December, January and February were well below pre-COVID levels. In January trending like, down (ph) 50%. So I am encouraged to see in March that, they are back up. They are back up a little bit ahead of pre-COVID levels. And so that's why we're kind of rebalancing the year. I think that we're going to have more stability throughout the balance to go year versus earlier thinking that we would be having a stronger second half versus first half. Yeah. Thank you, Josh.

            "content": "Thank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining today's call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operational performance across our business. The results reflect the strength and versatility of Johnson & Johnson and our commitment to improving health care outcomes around the world. 2023 has many important catalysts that can drive meaningful near- and long-term value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders. We remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business, Kenvue, which will position both companies to be more agile, focused and competitive. We are also expecting a number of pipeline advancements that will provide increased confidence in our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered a strong first quarter. Growth from our Pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by key assets in our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as uptake from new launches such as SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. 2023 is an important year of scientific innovation for our Pharmaceutical business. And in Q1, we announced that CARVYKTI, our BCMA cell therapy, met its primary endpoint in the CARTITUDE-4 study, a Phase 3 trial in multiple myeloma patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. We look forward to presenting these results in an upcoming major medical meeting. Additionally, our partners at Protagonist Therapeutics announced positive top line results from the Phase 2b FRONTIER 1 study of our Oral IL-23 in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We look forward to sharing this data and future development plans at an upcoming medical meeting. Finally, as we continually review our portfolio to prioritize the most transformational assets for ongoing investment and an assessment of the RSV vaccine landscape, the company made the decision to discontinue its investigational RSV adult vaccine program. This decision is part of a broader effort to make strategic choices for our pipeline and R&D investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect important data from key pipeline assets such as Nipocalimab and TREMFYA as well as the potential approval of Talquetamab. Importantly, I want to mention two additional highlights. First, the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer remains on track with the potential for final analysis later this year. We are also excited to present data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in muscle invasive bladder cancer at the American Urological Association's Annual Meeting this month, which demonstrated a promising complete response and safety profile. Regarding our Pharmaceutical business, I'd like to reiterate some comments I recently made at the Cowen Investor Conference in March related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the impact on the 2025 Pharmaceutical sales goal the team put forth during the 2021 Investor Day. While we don't speculate on currency, based on the current rates, the 2025 sales target of $60 billion is approximately $57 billion on a constant currency basis. In 2022 alone, FX had a negative impact of roughly $3 billion in Pharmaceuticals. While that is the math qualitatively since 2021, a number of things have changed in our portfolio. On the plus side, we've seen acceleration of some current and potential upcoming launches like TECVAYLI and Talquetamab. But (ph) to be balanced, we've also experienced competitive pressure on IMBRUVICA above what was anticipated in 2021. So many push and pulls, but we are striving to attain our operational goals. We are confident in our ability to exceed 2025 estimates The Street has out there today of approximately $54 billion. MedTech delivered a strong quarter of sales growth. We continued to advance key pipeline programs. For example, within our electrophysiology business, we reached a few milestones this quarter related to our pulse field ablation pipeline programs, including the European clinical study inspIRE, which achieved early success by meeting both primary safety and efficacy endpoints. Additionally, we announced completion of the first procedures in the European SmartfIRE clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our investigational dual energy catheter, which combines both pulse field and radio frequency ablation capabilities. As you know, we continue to prioritize investment in high growth areas, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Abiomed, which closed this past December. With Abiomed, MedTech now has 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. While it is still early days, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Abiomed. Patient utilization of Abiomed technologies grew mid to high-teens in both Europe and the United States and over 30% in Japan. We continue to see strong adoption of newer technologies, such as Impella 5.5 and we achieved record quarterly enrollment in both the STEMI-DTU and PROTECT IV pivotal trials as we continue to advance efforts in pursuit of Class I guidelines. For perspective, operational sales growth compared to the same quarter last year reported by Abiomed as a standalone company was 22%. In Orthopaedics, just this month, we obtained CE Mark for the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution, positioning us to expand our international footprint with this differentiated solution in total knee. Finally, the MedTech team is excited by the progress being made in regards to the Ottava general surgery robotic solution, and we remain on track to share more information in the second half of this year. Our Consumer Health business delivered double-digit first quarter sales growth driven by strategic price actions, strong demand and some stock replenishment. We remain on track to complete the separation of this business in 2023, assuming accommodative market conditions. Since the start of the year, we have been operating our Consumer Health business as a company within a company and continue to update our Form S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the opportunity to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the separation. Standup cost and stranded costs remain consistent with what we have stated previously with an active program well underway to reduce the stranded costs. Turning to notable enterprise events. I'd like to briefly touch on LTL's re-filing for bankruptcy on April 4. Neither LTL's original filing nor this re-filing is an acknowledgment of wrongdoing nor an indication that the company has changed its long-standing position that its talcum powder products are safe. Our goal continues to be for an equitable and efficient resolution of the cosmetic talc litigation against the company, and we believe this refiling represents progress towards that goal. As a reminder, LTL's bankruptcy filing will not have an impact upon the Kenvue separation, and the talc liabilities in the United States and Canada will remain with Johnson & Johnson. As part of the re-filing, we have proposed a reorganization plan that had significant support from Claimants and includes a payment of $8.9 billion in present value over a 25-year period. LTL will continue to work through the process set forth by the bankruptcy court and expects to present the reorganization plan to the court in mid-May. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And in 2022, we successfully executed against all pillars. R&D investment remains our number one priority and driver of long-term growth and value creation. We know the value our investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.3% increase, marking our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic business development opportunities that enable Johnson & Johnson to create value for patients, customers and shareholders. Our final priority is share repurchase programs when appropriate. In fact, this past quarter, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program announced late last year. We are confident in our strong financial position, including our AAA-rated balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital across all strategic priorities. We believe this strength differentiates Johnson & Johnson and enables us to pull the appropriate levers to set us up for long-term success. Moving on to our full year 2023 guidance for the enterprise. Based on our strong start to the year, we are pleased to raise our guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 up 1 percentage point in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, or up $1 billion in a range of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth up 1 percentage point in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at 1.08. The euro spot rate as of late last week was 1.10. We continue to estimate there would be minimal impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year as the dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies. We are maintaining the guidance we provided in January for our adjusted pre-tax operating margin, other income and expense, interest expense and tax rate. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 per share and tightening the range to $10.50 to $10.60, or $10.55 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, or 4% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. This favorable currency impact, coupled with our strong operational outlook, results in an increase to our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year by $0.10 per share and tightening the range to $10.60 to $10.70, or $10.65 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4.5% to 5.5%, or 5% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. In Pharmaceuticals, we maintain our expectation of delivering above market growth in 2023 driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. This growth considers the potential composition of matter patent expiry of STELARA, which we currently assume will occur in late 2023 in the United States. Further, we continue to expect 2023 impact from other post-LOE products, including REMICADE, ZYTIGA and XEPLION as well as increased austerity measures across Europe. Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we do not anticipate material sales beyond that which were recorded in the first quarter as our contractual commitments are complete. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by increased procedures and commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate relatively stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels for the remainder of the year with normal seasonality. Regarding quarterly phasing, given the strength of our first quarter results, we now expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. When modeling Consumer Health growth rates in 2023, it is important to take into consideration prior year comparisons as well as the robust cough, cold and flu season and the one-time restocking that occurred in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first half of 2022 was impacted by supply constraints. A few brief announcements before we take your questions. Continuing our efforts to increase our transparency and assist with your modeling, we are planning to post a patent table, including U.S. pharmaceutical patents, to our investor website in the quarter. In addition, please mark your calendars for December 5, as we will be hosting an enterprise business review at the New York Stock Exchange focused on the new Johnson & Johnson, highlighting both our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. We will provide additional details about the event in the coming months. Before we turn to your questions, let me state how proud we are regarding our team's continued hard work and unwavering commitment. Our sights are set on the future, focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson. We are confident that our current plans position us for near-term success, long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. I'll now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question? Hey. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the questions. So first, with respect the $57 billion. I wanted to make sure that I was clear on the record since I had the opportunity to do that about a month ago that everybody understood the message around the math component of it. We feel very good about our pipeline. We continue to work towards some really good data that came out this quarter around multiple myeloma, MARIPOSA, which we'll talk about in a minute. We continue to see some uptake of some of our newer products and the goal is still that for us. But you'll have a much better and much more informed and probably timely update once we hit the December 5 meeting at the New York Stock Exchange, so stay posted on that. What I do feel comfortable though is that we're moving certainly in the right direction. I wanted to take out the unclarity that maybe was created by currency and the dramatic movements that occurred over the last 18 months. So for MARIPOSA, I would say the study of RYBREVANT and Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer versus TAGRISSO remains very much on track. It's an event-driven trial. So there's the potential for final analysis later this year, which is actually two quarters ahead than what we had originally expected, was originally expected to be second quarter of 2024. The accrual to the study we can say is very rapid as there was tremendous interest. And the interim analysis was specified in the protocol with a significantly limited follow-up and supported the continuation of the study. We were blinded to that interim analysis. And as far as what we need to show, I think we're just going to let the science dictate, let the trial results come out. But we feel pretty comfortable where we're at now and pleased with how quickly the trial enrolled. Sure. Thanks, Matt for the question. A lot to maybe unpack possibly there. But let me first start with our base assumption, the guidance, which has the underlying assumption that in the U.S., STELARA will lose exclusivity in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year and that's kind of the assumption that we're going on. What I would say is that's somewhat fluid. At this point, there are currently no biosimilars approved. In terms of our planning, we are expecting -- despite learning a lot over the last few years with REMICADE, we're expecting a steeper erosion curve than what was experienced there because this is a self-administered subcutaneous product. There will be multiple competitors on the market at some point, and they may have the affordability of interchangeability. But we may remain committed to growing through the patent exploration. One of the, the great things about our portfolio, whether we're talking within Pharmaceuticals or across the broader businesses, we've got 30 products or platforms that generate over $1 billion in annual revenue. So we're not dependent on one product the way others may have. In terms of unpacking your question maybe a little bit further, I got the sense you were heading towards M&A. Certainly, we always remain vigilant and look at a number of opportunities, making sure there's a strategic fit before we act. If there's a strategic fit, then we're going to look to deploy capital in the way that returns to shareholders to compensate them, quite frankly for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. But we're not going to do anything out of desperation based on the breadth of our product portfolio. We are lucky in that we've got a strong balance sheet to do whatever we'd like, but we want to make sure it makes good strategic and financial sense. So that's probably the best way to answer that. I know Jennifer and the team are very committed to growing through the loss of STELARA whenever that may occur. And the pipeline data that we're generating now as well as really the early success we're having in some of these newer products, I think, positions us well to meet those goals. Great. Thanks for the question, Terence. Let me start with the second one first with respect to the Oral IL-23, where our partners at Protagonist announced some, for very encouraging data out of the Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 study. So we do plan to present data from various pre-clinical and clinical studies on this compound at medical conferences beginning in the second quarter of this year. We believe this could be very much an important and underappreciated asset within our immunology portfolio. With respect to the litigation, we thought that this could come up as a question. So we're very pleased to have Andrew White, our Assistant General Counsel, here with us today. But let me say a little maybe a couple of qualitative things from my seat, and then we can have Andrew either clean it up or give you some more specifics. But it is important to note that these cases and we stand by the safety of the product, there's decades of independent research conducted by reputable government agencies, patient advocacy groups as well as academic institutions that support the safety of cosmetic talc. Furthermore, it was only two years ago, [indiscernible] hearing where the judge really restricted the use of many of the claims, supposedly scientific claims that were being made by the plaintiff attorneys in this case and many pundits even classified it as junk (ph) signs at that point. Here, we have the support of 60,000 to 70,000 claimants that would vote for the proposal as it's currently presented. But curiously, we've got a small number of plaintiff's attorneys who don't even want to give their claimants, the right to vote. So we're simply asking that they get the right to vote. Now from my chair as CFO, it is unfortunate that we've got to put dollars towards, quite frankly, baseless scientific claims. However, litigation is inherently costly when it's protracted and it's also inherently uncertain. And when court (ph) proposal really aims to bring certainty in a very efficient manner for all really involved, something that would otherwise take probably decades to resolve. So let me turn it over to Andrew in terms of maybe any of the specifics that you can add. Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Well, first, I do want to correct the record a little bit on you. Responsibly was in front of both cautious as well as optimistic. So we've moved from responsibly cautious to responsibly optimistic. Why do I say that? It's because we did see some dynamics within our P&L, the team's great ability to really manage our resources effectively with the backdrop of really a company separation that could lend itself to some stranded costs. We're managing those extremely well. There is still inflation within the P&L. I don't think we should say that it's now behind us. We have a good data point with respect to where we landed Q1. I'm very pleased with the first quarter results and the strength of that and why we've maybe moved from a little bit more of a consistent approach throughout the year versus a stronger second half from the first half is really around the first quarter results. So in terms of Pharmaceutical pricing, it was still unfavorable as you might expect with respect to Pharmaceutical, but not as unfavorable as we anticipated. And then maybe Ashley can talk here, too. When we came out in January, there was -- the pandemic was kind of full blown in the Asia Pacific region. And we did see a very positive data point in March with respect to China specifically. I don't know, Ashley, anything to add there? Yeah. And Larry with respect to operating margins, it's still very early in the year. It's still only April. If we have the opportunity to manage these macroeconomic headwinds that we ended the year with and then maybe provide the flexibility for further investment for great opportunities down the road that fortify the future, we'll certainly look to do that. You guys know us well enough that if we don't find those meaningful opportunities, we'll probably have the opportunity to take up guidance down the road. But my first preference would be to deploy that in investment opportunities that secure both MedTech and Pharmaceuticals for the future. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Louise. So I think we're always looking at combinations. The one that's most prolific at this point now is certainly one for non-small cell lung cancer, which really impacts about 20% of lung cancer that's diagnosed today with a certain mutation. We're very much looking forward to the data that may read-out later this year with respect to that. In terms of new areas, I know that the teams are looking very much. I would say some of the new areas that we're coming into now would be some of the bispecific antibodies with respect to multiple myeloma rounding out that portfolio. We know how I want to say almost personalized that disease is and having multiple options for treatments and maybe even someday potentially cures certainly lends itself with the multiple options that we have. We're going to be focused on multiple myeloma, obviously, prostate cancer, lung cancer. We're very excited about some of the data that could read out on what I'll call the MedTech, Pharma combo of -- for bladder cancer and with the TARIS device with the drug eluting BALVERSA. So there's multiple plays within oncology, which is now our biggest franchise with immunology in terms of sales contribution to the pharmaceutical success. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Geoff. So with respect to IMBRUVICA, I would say that we're not expecting any more withdrawals at this point. It is obviously based on our performance, encountering competitive pressures. But it's really the competition that's been the biggest driver in terms of the performance that we're not seeing there, quite frankly. But it's -- the withdrawal was a very small part of our business to begin with, but we don't anticipate other withdrawals at this point. With respect to your second question and supply on CARVYKTI, I would say that you probably did read the announcement recently that we did sign on for additional capacity to scale up some production and increase availability moving forward. The manufacturing is ramping up to supply markets. We have really tremendous demand given some of the data that supports this CARVYKTI, the CAR-T for Johnson & Johnson. And we're committed to doing everything we can to accelerate our manufacturing abilities to meet that demand. We work in our facility and again continues to progress. And it will serve as an important part of our supply chain network for not just this but other cell therapies in the future."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJessica Moore: Hello, everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the third quarter results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will kick us off with opening remarks and highlight key catalysts within the segments. I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the enterprise, as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then provide an overview of our pipeline advancements, cash position, capital allocation priorities and guidance for 2024, as well as qualitative considerations for 2025. Jennifer Taubert, John Reed and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and hello, everyone. As you will hear, we delivered strong results in the third quarter with 6.3% operational sales growth. Our performance, once again, reflects the unique breadth of our business and our commitment to delivering the next wave of healthcare innovation to patients around the world. It also reflects the work we have done to shift our pipeline and portfolio to high innovation and high growth markets. That work continues, which you saw with the recently completed acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx, Proteologix and NM26 bispecific antibody in Innovative Medicine. And we are pleased with the progress we are making. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a second consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 11 key brands growing double-digits. DARZALEX became the first product in our portfolio to reach $3 billion in sales in a single quarter. And as you will hear, our pipeline of high innovation, high growth potential assets is advancing rapidly with five major U.S. and EC approvals in the quarter. This includes FDA approval of RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE as first line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer, a transformational step forward for patients, and FDA approval of TREMFYA for active ulcerative colitis, which represents a significant opportunity for Johnson & Johnson, given 75% of STELARA sales today come from inflammatory bowel disease. And with filings and reviews underway for many of our innovative medicines that have the potential to generate $5 billion in peak year sales, we are increasingly confident in our near- and long-term growth trajectory. In MedTech, you can see the impact of our portfolio shift to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, we are now category leaders in four of the largest and highest growth cardiovascular intervention medtech markets, which in Q3 translated to another quarter of double-digit growth across the Cardiovascular portfolio. And with the full market launch of Shockwave E8 peripheral IVL catheter, we are seeing an immediate impact of the Shockwave acquisition. In Vision, growth is accelerating, and we expect that to continue with the recent full market release of TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S. and ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day contact lenses. We are also excited about the future of our surgery business. As you will recall, in November 2023, we committed to submitting the OTTAVA robotic surgical system for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2024 to initiate clinical trials. I'm pleased to announce that we have met that milestone with the IDE application submitted in Q3. Looking across the enterprise, our high innovation, high growth strategy is working and our progress this quarter speaks to the strength of our commercial and innovation capabilities. We have increased adjusted operational EPS guidance pre-M&A for the third quarter in a row. We have invested $18 billion in high innovation, high growth M&A this year. Based on this quarter's results, we are confident in our expectations for 2025 through the end of the decade and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call back to Jess.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.3%, with growth of 7.6% in the U.S. and 4.6% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 90 basis points. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.11 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.69 a year ago. Results in the quarter were impacted by the updated talc litigation settlement proposal, as well as acquired IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.42, representing decreases of 13.3% and 9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Results were impacted by the acquired IPR&D expense of $1.25 billion or approximately 1,900 basis points associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.6 billion increased 6.3%, with growth of 7.5% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price increases associated with Argentina hyperinflation, consistent with market practice. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 22.9%, primarily driven by share gains of 4 points across all lines of therapy, with 7.7 points of growth in the front line setting as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $286 million, with growth of 87.6%, driven by share gains, continued capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. This reflects sequential growth of 53.2% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. TECVAYLI sales were $135 million in the quarter with growth of 21.4%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remained strong, while sequential growth was flat due to continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, TALVEY continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth. We anticipate disclosing TALVEY sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in other oncology. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 26.3%, primarily driven by share gains in metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer and favorable inventory dynamics. RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in other oncology as we expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing RYBREVANT sales in the first quarter of 2025. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 14.3%, driven by strong market growth and share gains in PsO and PsA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. STELARA declined 5.7%, driven by unfavorable net patient mix and share loss, partially offset by market growth. As a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered Europe as of July, and we anticipate U.S. biosimilar entry in January 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 55.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence. In pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI grew 17.4% and 15.2%, respectively, driven by market growth, share gains and patient mix. As mentioned last quarter, REMICADE and SIMPONI realized limited sales in Europe as we prepare for the return of distribution rights in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $7.9 billion increased 6.4% with growth in the U.S. of 7.8% and 5% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 270 basis points on worldwide growth, 360 basis points in the U.S. and 180 basis points outside of the U.S. Overall, MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 10.7%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive PFA ablation catheter uptake in the U.S., as well as prior year trade inventory dynamics and VBP in China. Abiomed delivered growth of 16.3%, driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $229 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact lenses and other performance improved to 4.7%, driven by continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, a one-time benefit from a change in U.S. contract shipping terms worth approximately 150 basis points, as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions. Surgical Vision grew 1.9%, driven by TECNIS PureSee and TECNIS Eyhance, partially offset by China VBP and softness in the U.S. Surgery declined 0.7%, with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 110 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, as well as VBP and the anticorruption campaign in China. This was partially offset by commercial execution, strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price increases associated with Argentina hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Orthopaedics growth of 1.3% was primarily driven by success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures, impacts of China VBP and revenue disruption from the previously announced Orthopaedics transformation. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing nearly $5 billion or 22% of sales, which includes a $1.25 billion payment to secure the global rights to NM26 bispecific antibody. Even when excluding this investment, R&D as a percent of sales increased 30 basis points. Selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percent of sales was leveraged 100 basis points, driven by the realization of optimization efforts following the Kenvue separation. Interest income was $99 million as compared to $182 million of income last year, driven by a higher net debt position primarily related to the financing impacts of the Shockwave acquisition. Other income and expense was a net expense of $1.8 billion compared to an expense of $0.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in expense was driven by a $1.75 billion charge related to the talc litigation settlement proposal, partially offset by prior year higher unrealized mark to market losses on public securities, as well as the monetization of royalty rights. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 17.4% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by the tax treatment of the NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition and OECD Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 15.6% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let's look at adjusted income before tax [by segment] (ph). Innovative Medicine margin declined from 45.4% to 37.9%, primarily driven by the $1.25 billion acquired IPR&D expense to secure the global rights for NM26 bispecific antibody, partially offset by the monetization of royalty rights. MedTech margin declined from 24.7% to 24.1%, driven by increased R&D investment and lapping of a prior year divestiture gain, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.6% to 32.4%, with acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 560 basis points. Starting in 2025, aligned with recent FASB reporting disclosure requirements, we will begin providing additional P&L details by segment. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jessica. In the third quarter, Johnson & Johnson delivered results that illustrate not only the breadth of the business, but our ability to consistently beat financial expectations. Innovative Medicine continued to build on strong first-half revenue momentum. We are advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline, achieving significant clinical and regulatory milestones across key therapeutic areas. Our MedTech business, with the addition of Shockwave, delivered operational growth of 6.4% in the quarter, but did experience headwinds in the Asia Pacific region. We continue to fortify our future advancing the OTTAVA robotic surgery system to IDE, expanding VELYS use and launching new intraocular lenses. Due to dynamics in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, we are taking a responsibly conservative approach by assuming no material improvement in that part of the business for the remainder of this year. And as such, we expect MedTech adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2024 to be closer to 5% versus the 6% we referenced last quarter. The strength of a diversified business enables us to more than offset volatility in one part of our business, but yet be in a position to once again increase 2024 guidance for the enterprise. Before diving into the results, I'll take a moment to touch on some enterprise-wide updates from the quarter. We are making progress towards resolving talc litigation. Our pre-packaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from the current claimants of roughly 83% as well as the future claimants representative. As announced last Thursday, the case will be heard in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. And while we remain committed to bringing this matter to a resolution, it would be premature to speculate on timing. In addition to the pipeline highlights Joaquin mentioned, there are some additional notable advancements throughout the quarter. In oncology, we received U.S. and EU regulatory approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy as a second line treatment for adults with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. With FDA priority review underway for a subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT, along with data supporting a treatment regimen to reduce adverse events, we are building a best-in-class EGFR portfolio. We also presented Phase 1 data for RYBREVANT with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, extending the asset's potential beyond lung cancer. In multiple myeloma, we advanced our leadership position with FDA approval and filing of two DARZALEX FASPRO quad-based regimens for newly diagnosed patients. With CARVYKTI, we announced three-year follow-up data showing significantly extended overall survival and gained approval for commercial production at our Ghent facility, further expanding supply capacity. Finally, in oncology, we added to the growing evidence base for our TARIS platform with positive Phase 2b data in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and positive interim to Phase 2 data in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. In neuroscience, we submitted to the U.S. and European regulatory bodies for what would be the first global approval of nipocalimab for the treatment of people living with generalized myasthenia gravis. For the remainder of the year, we expect approval of TREMFYA subcu for Crohn's disease and data readouts on JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ-4804, our co-antibody therapeutic for inflammatory bowel disease, aticaprant for adjunctive major depressive disorder and nipocalimab for rheumatoid arthritis. In MedTech, we completed enrollment of the Omny-IRE clinical trial to evaluate safety and effectiveness in mapping and treating symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during standard ablation procedures. Also in Cardiovascular, we are preparing for the anticipated approval of VARIPULSE in the U.S. and the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. In Orthopaedics, we launched several exciting new products in the U.S., including our VELYS SPINE robot and VOLT Plating System. The plentiful pipeline progress across our businesses will ensure continued success. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $14 billion compared to $12 billion last year, which included eight months contribution from the Consumer Health business. We ended the third quarter with $20 billion of cash and marketable securities and $36 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $16 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our strong balance sheet enables us to strategically invest to grow our business while simultaneously returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. During the quarter, we invested nearly $5 billion in research and development. This is an increase over 2023 levels even after excluding acquired in-process R&D expense. Thus far in 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $18 billion for strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements, which includes the recent acquisition of V-Wave, another innovative treatment in heart failure, which closed last week. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are increasing our adjusted operational sales guidance. We now expect growth in the range of 5.7% to 6.2% with a midpoint of 6%. We are also increasing operational sales growth by $200 million to a range of 6.3% to 6.8% with a midpoint of $89.6 billion or 6.6%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of $1.10, slightly above last quarter's guidance. This results in an estimated incremental positive foreign currency impact of $200 million, reducing our previous full-year negative impact to $1 billion. As such, we expect reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6% with a midpoint of $88.6 billion or 5.4%. Regarding the rest of the P&L, with the addition of the V-Wave transaction, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting and related R&D investment, we would be on track to improve operating margins by 50 basis points, which is consistent with what we guided to at the beginning of the year. As we strive to advance and accelerate our pipeline, you can anticipate elevated levels of investment in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is now projected to be between $450 million and $550 million, $150 million greater than our previous guidance. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, an increase versus previous guidance, driven by the one-time monetization of royalty rights, which Jessica referenced, that will be utilized for that higher Q4 investment I referenced a moment ago. Our effective tax rate, consistent with previous guidance, is expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full year. Similar to last quarter, we have provided an EPS bridge to outline the impact from acquisition activity throughout the year. Before the impact of the V-Wave acquisition, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again increasing. As the schedule reflects, we are expecting an incremental $0.10 per share increase on our operational performance for a total increase of $0.18 per share for the year. On this basis, when excluding acquisition activity throughout the year, EPS growth is 9.2%. To account for the completion of the V-Wave transaction, as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per share in 2025. Combined, this yields an updated 2024 adjusted operational EPS guidance of $9.91 at the midpoint of the range, basically flat year-on-year despite absorbing approximately $0.92 of acquisition activity. While not predicting the impact of currency movements utilizing the recent exchange rates just referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year positive impact of $0.02 per share. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.93 at the midpoint. We are still finalizing our plans for next year, but let me provide you some preliminary qualitative commentary to inform your modeling for 2025. For Innovative Medicine, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver growth despite a significant LOE resulting in sales above the $57 billion commitment we stated in 2021. This will be driven by our end market brands and continued progress from our recently launched products, including TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding the STELARA LOE, we are planning for biosimilar entries in the U.S. in January, assuming that HUMIRA's erosion curve is a relatively good proxy for your models. We continue to expect a negative impact associated with the Part D redesign. In our pipeline, we anticipate data readouts across all our priority platforms: anticipated approvals of TREMFYA subcu in Crohn's disease, RYBREVANT subcu for lung cancer and nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis, as well as potential filings for TARIS in bladder cancer and aticaprant in major depressive disorder. As a reminder, TREMFYA, RYBREVANT and TARIS continue to be the three largest underappreciated assets in terms of our revenue projections versus what analysts are estimating for the back half of this decade. For MedTech, we continue to expect to deliver on our long-term objective identified at last year's Enterprise Business Review of growing operational sales in the upper end of the 2022 through 2027 weighted average market growth rate of 5% to 7%. We also expect continued adoption of newer products across all MedTech businesses, such as VARIPULSE in electrophysiology, VELYS enabling technology across Orthopaedics, Odyssey and PureSee in Surgical Vision and contributions from our Abiomed and Shockwave integration. Specific to volume-based pricing in China, we expect continued impacts from the rollout of the 2024 tenders in Orthopaedics sports and intraocular lenses and anticipate VBP to continue expanding across provinces and products. Moving to the rest of the P&L. When thinking about operating margin, there are pluses and minuses. Tailwinds include an anticipated reduction of acquired IPR&D expense year-over-year, continued focus on MedTech margin improvement and continued OpEx optimization benefits post the separation. Working against us is unfavorable product mix driven by STELARA biosimilar entrants and Part D redesign. With a brief look at your models last week, the consensus margin does not appear unreasonable, and we'll provide further clarity in January once we complete our 2025 plan. We do not expect to maintain the heightened levels of interest income due to a reduction in interest rates and impact from debt experienced in 2024 related to acquisition activity. Regarding other income and expense, we expect lower net other income due to the non-recurring nature of the monetization of royalty rights experienced in Q3, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, as well as income lost on the Kenvue dividend. Lastly, based on what we know today, under current tax law, we anticipate our 2025 tax rate to be slightly lower than our anticipated 2024 tax rate. To wrap up prior to Q&A, we are pleased with our underlying 2024 performance that simultaneously fortified a strong foundation for continued success heading into 2025. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe just one on talc here. I know this is still limited comments, but it seems though the company has obviously made some advancements here into getting this behind the organization. Maybe just can you help us a little bit in terms of, from your perspective, next key steps to watch from here? And what is J&J's overall level of confidence that you have a path to resolve this in the relative near term for the story? Thanks so much.\nJoaquin Duato: Yeah, thank you, Chris. And as you have heard me before, our intention with respect to the talc litigation is to bring a responsible, final and comprehensive resolution to these claims. And we are making meaningful progress to do just that. We have filed our pre-packaged reorganization plan with the support of 83% of the claimants. And also, we have had a decision of the court to keep the filing in Houston. So, as I said, we are making progress in this resolution that I refer. As far as next steps, Erik?\nErik Haas: Hi. Thanks, Chris. This is Erik Haas, Head of Worldwide Litigation. Judge Lopez last week on Thursday, after ruling that the case properly and appropriately should remain in Texas, ordered the parties to meet and confer and agree to a schedule for the expeditious resolution of the case. And by that, it means setting forth a schedule to get through to the confirmation procedure, addressing any ancillary motions, whether the motions to dismiss or issues relating to the votes. And the parties are in that process. We contemplate putting forth a schedule that resolves those issues through the end of the year for a confirmation hearing sometime at the beginning of next year. So that's the schedule we're on.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, on MedTech, maybe help us understand the impact of the one-time items in Q3, such as the ortho SKU rationalization. How you're thinking about the impact from the hurricanes in Q4? And what gives you confidence you can deliver the high end of that 5% to 7% next year? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTim Schmid: Larry, thank you for the question. And we're proud of the 6.4% operational growth for the quarter -- sorry, 5.7% for full year. And I think the results really talked about the success of our deliberate move into higher-growth, higher-margin categories, especially in the cardiovascular space. You'll recall, and you'll see that from our results, almost $300 million has been added from the Shockwave acquisition, which continues to perform to expectations as does Abiomed. And we've also added to the portfolio acquisition of Laminar in the fourth quarter of last year, and then more recently, the announced closure of the acquisition of V-Wave, which, once again, takes us into even more exciting high-growth, high-margin opportunities within Cardiovascular. Specifically to Orthopaedics, we believe this is going to be another solid year for Orthopaedics, 3.2% growth for the year. We did have a slightly softer third quarter, which was a result, to your point, of the restructure within Orthopaedics. And as we look to the full year, we expect a return to a significantly better performance, especially in Orthopaedics, which typically has a stronger fourth quarter. And we are seeing tremendous performance specifically within the hips and knees categories growing 6% and 7%. And I think that's really been enabled by the success of our enabling technologies in VELYS in knees, which also, by the way, we've added indication of the [Uni Knee] (ph), as well as our KINCISE and Hip Navigation systems within hips. I'd also add to the Orthopaedics performance, we are significantly addressing portfolio gaps within our trauma portfolio with the launch of TriLeap, [indiscernible] and VOLT in the back half of the year. And I think you know our spine portfolio has been challenged, and we're addressing that with the launch of TELIGEN, our new TriALTIS thoracal lumbar system and the new spine robot, which we just received approval for. As it relates the hurricanes, we did see the impact, certainly of Hurricane Helene, in the final weeks of the third quarter and continue to see the impact of Milton over the last coming days especially in the areas most impacted by those storms. I do think the watch out that we all need to watch carefully is certainly the impact of the recently announced IV saline shortages, which if they do persist, could potentially impact surgical procedures across our portfolio. Thank you, Larry.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to ask you how you see TREMFYA, JNJ-2113 and some of your other pipeline products coming together to replace sales lost to STELARA and then take share from entrenched competitors? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Hi. Louise. It's Jennifer. And good morning, everyone. And I wanted to start off by having a chance to really recognize and thank all my Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for fabulous quarter in the third quarter. We really continue to deliver against our strategy with 11 key brands having double-digit growth and achieving a few really notable milestones, notably the TREMFYA approval and launch in ulcerative colitis, also RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in first line non-small cell lung cancer, and we also completed the acquisition of NM26, which is a Phase 2-ready asset for atopic dermatitis. So, as we take a look at the immunology portfolio, we're really excited about TREMFYA, what we see as the prospects ahead. I just mentioned that we got approval during the quarter for that product in ulcerative colitis. We believe we truly have a winning proposition for that asset in IBD. And it's off to a really nice start with a good -- a really strong reception amongst the medical community. And we see that product having a lot of strength because it's the only dual act of IL-23. So, it blocks both IL-23 and the CD64 receptor cells. It really sets what we believe is a new bar in terms of efficacy with the highest rate of endoscopic normalization. And we've got rigorous head-to-head data versus STELARA showing superiority in Crohn's disease. And we think that we've got unrivaled flexibility and what will ultimately be a subcu both induction and maintenance dose for TREMFYA. So, TREMFYA was $4 billion in sales for the quarter. And that was really on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis alone. When we take a look going forward and what we had seen with STELARA in terms of the strength in IBD and the potential, we think that TREMFYA definitely is an asset that is STELARA size or bigger and better. So, a lot of exciting opportunity for us ahead. For 2113, we're really excited about our oral asset that we're developing. And I'll let John Reed, my colleague, John Reed, actually talk about why we're so excited about it and some of the data -- upcoming data there, but we do think that being able to have that advanced efficacy and known safety profile in a simple oral tablet is not only going to be great for the existing biologics' appropriate patients, but we think it gives us a great market expansion opportunity moving into earlier lines of therapy as well. John?\nJohn Reed: Yeah, thanks. The 2113 is really moving along nicely. As you know, this is our targeted oral peptide, a very exquisite, elegantly designed molecule that binds to and blocks the IL-23 receptor, and it is orally available with once-daily dosing. The psoriasis indication is fully enrolled now, four Phase 3 studies, which are quite broad and include head to heads against TYK2 inhibitors as well as both adult and adolescent patients as well as a study in patients that have disease affecting hard-to-treat areas, scalp and other parts of the anatomy that can be very difficult to clear typically. So, we're really looking quite comprehensively there, and the data will be rolling out in the next few months. So, we look forward to sharing those at the appropriate time. In inflammatory bowel disease, we're in a signal-seeking Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis where we're exploring different doses before moving into more advanced studies, given that the IL-23 pathway is well validated inflammatory bowel disease. Thanks to STELARA and TREMFYA, we're quite confident that those studies will come through for us, but we'll wait for those data later this year to see how that oral medication is faring there. The other thing I'd maybe mention just in case it's not on your radar is we also have a co-antibody approach, we call it 4804, where gus and gol, TREMFYA and our TNF inhibitor are combined for patients tend to be on the more refractory side. And we're in the middle of inflammatory bowel disease studies there that will read out next year. So, really excited about that antibody combination as well. So altogether, the immunology portfolio is really quite robust and particularly in inflammatory bowel disease in the areas of dermatology where we've had traditional strengths.\nJennifer Taubert: We really do think that we've got a winning portfolio for inflammatory bowel diseases. And maybe just one addition because I know we've had questions on this in the past on 2113, we're going to be developing that really across the spectrum, so both ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease. So, we're starting off in ulcerative colitis, but absolutely have plans to develop it in Crohn's as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just on the multiple myeloma portfolio, obviously, very nice growth in CARVYKTI this quarter. I know you spoke to some of the drivers, but just was wondering if you can elaborate on what you're seeing in the second-line setting at this point? And then, as you look at TECVAYLI through the rest of this year into next year, what's it going to take to really see an acceleration in growth in this product? Or is this -- or do we have to wait until we get to earlier lines of treatment here to see growth again in that franchise? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Hi, Terence, thanks so much for the question on multiple myeloma. And I won't go into a lot of detail on DARZALEX, but it's worth noting that we had $3 billion in sales, more than 20% growth. And DARZALEX really continues to perform quite strongly for us as we continue to grow share, particularly in frontline, in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients. I really appreciate the question on CARVYKTI. So, $286 million in sales, 88% growth year-over-year and 53% quarter-over-quarter. And we're really seeing that continued growth for a number of reasons. So first, we're seeing very strong demand based on the CARTITUDE-4 approval for that second-line-and-beyond patients. In addition, overall survival data was just presented for CARVYKTI in this line, which was very, very significant and further adds to the importance of this medicine for patients with multiple myeloma. And the other aspect is we continue to progress really nicely with our continued capacity expansion, both in terms of number of slots per day in Raritan, we gained approval for our Ghent manufacturing site in Europe for commercial production, that is now underway and able to serve patients, and our CMO in the United States as well is producing on the clinical end. And so, all the way around from performance of the product from new data as well as continued capacity expansion, we continue to see very strong performance for CARVYKTI. And as we discussed before, I don't know that we will see that as a complete exact linear growth curve quarter-to-quarter simply because the capacity expansion works in a bit more of a stair-step fashion, but as we have discussed, second quarter for us being definitely more robust than the first half, that's playing through. And I think if you think about that going forward, that makes a lot of sense. And we're over 4,200 patients now with CARVYKTI, and it is the most successful CAR-T launch for across -- throughout the industry across all CAR-Ts. Then last, you asked about TECVAYLI and talquetamab. So, if we take a look at -- start off basically with TEC. So, TEC sales were $135 million and 21% growth for the quarter, but it was flat sequentially. We're seeing really nice uptake in the market in terms of new patients. There's also a dynamic where physicians are treating with longer treatment durations. So, we do think that there's a lot of continued growth and expansion for the product. It's performing very well for patients and not only in its current lines of therapy, but we're also taking a look and studying it in combinations, whether with DARZALEX, whether with TAL. And so, we do believe that there's a lot of growth potential on there. For TALVEY, we're not reporting out the sales yet. I think we'll start on that probably next year. But both TAL and TEC, we continue to expand not only with the academic, but also out into the community setting. And so, we think there's a lot of growth ahead.\nJohn Reed: Maybe just a couple of things to highlight as well. With TEC, that is not only the first-in-class BCMA-targeting T-cell engager, but the data really showed also is best-in-class relative to other molecules in that -- of that type. The deepest responses -- complete response rates are approaching 50%, about half of patients. Duration of response is nearly two years, and very low discontinuation rates, less than 5%, showing the weight-adjusted dosing where we can really optimize for the patients, it's really playing out there. Very excited about the early data we're seeing when we combine TEC with dara, where we're seeing really high response rates in patients who have been multiply treated and now in Phase 3 studies in patients with one to three prior lines. And then, similar story with TAL. That is a B-cell preserving target, as you know. So, there are fewer risks of severe infections with TAL. And it has shown in the late line, the highest overall response rates of any T-cell engager bispecific for myeloma. So, we think there's a lot of upside opportunity there. And again, the data in combo with dara are really impressive. So, we're marching along with that combination and where we can have the benefits of both the T cell engager together with the CD38 class. And really only J&J is positioned to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick question on the EP business. I mean, obviously, that's very topical. You haven't really seen much of a slowdown. I appreciate Q3 was probably arguably the first quarter where we had a more -- a full quarter of PFA launching. I guess, I'm just curious about what you think the underlying market is growing and where PFA is versus RF, and also, as we look ahead to 2025 and VARIPULSE, how that changes dynamics for J&J's EP business. Thanks so much.\nTim Schmid: Thank you, Danielle. And as you said, it is a really exciting time to be in electrophysiology. And we couldn't be more proud of the significant leadership position we've held in this category for more than 20 years. And just to put our performance in context, our EP business is a $5 billion business, which grew 11% in the third quarter and 17% year-to-date. We are actively progressing our launch of VARIPULSE in EMEA and in Japan, where we still are executing against our soft launches. We've had over 800 successful cases. We shared the data from our admIRE study at the recent HRS meeting showing 85% primary effectiveness in that portfolio and that product. And we believe we've got a product that really will hunt. As it relates to the U.S., you're right, we're seeing continued competition, especially in the ablation space, given that we don't currently have a PFA product. But having spent a lot of time in EP labs over the last couple of weeks, I can tell you that we are incredibly excited for the availability of VARIPULSE, which we expect to have approval sometime later this quarter or in Q1 of next year. We are still, by the way, mapping the majority of those cases, Danielle. That's what most people don't see is that while we may not have that product in the portfolio, we are mapping more than 50% of competitive cases. In fact, we've updated our market-leading CARTO software to actually reflect better visualization for competitive products. And what we've seen in the market, and I can't give you specific data, but a significant increase in procedures on the time it's taking EPs to perform ablation procedures with PFA. And by the way, today, we're benefiting from the volume increase from PFA even though we don't have that catheter. And so, that combination of the 5,500 installed base of CARTO system's best-in-class mapping and highly trained mappers, we believe, is a significant advantage and positions us extremely well when PFA comes to market. I will also say that similar to RF, which by the way, we still believe has a play within the portfolio, we have the best-in-class RF catheter with QDOT, 86% primary effectiveness, this winning strategy in RF has been a full portfolio. And similarly, in PFA, beyond our first launch with VARIPULSE, you will see a full portfolio of focal, large focal single shot and dual energy catheters. By the way, we already applied for CE marking for our dual energy catheter. And so, we're confident in our leadership position in EP and our sources of differentiation for the future. Thank you, Danielle.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nShagun Singh: Good. Thank you so much. I was hoping you could elaborate on the dynamics that you're seeing in the Asia Pacific region in MedTech, specifically China. Could you quantify the headwind? When do you expect it to normalize? And you did talk about China VBP, and that has expanded into additional provinces and products. So, could you just elaborate on the impact there, and how we should think about it in '25? Thank you.\nTim Schmid: Thank you, Shagun. And yes, we've had a myriad of issues hitting us in the Asia Pacific region of late. And let me just highlight a couple, and I'll certainly get to your question on China. Firstly, you may know that in February of this year in Korea, the government initiated or at least a strike was initiated among the healthcare professional community. Unfortunately, we don't see any end in sight to that. And so that certainly has been a headwind. We're seeing macroeconomic pressures in Japan. And then, more importantly, to your question, the ongoing impact of volume-based procurement, which has also been exacerbated by the anti-corruption campaign. And by the way, while we believe this is absolutely the right thing to do and we support it for the long term, it is impacting procedures and the engagement by healthcare professionals with companies like ours, especially on premium products. We have a leadership position. We have the largest medtech company in China. And given the high leadership positions, we are seeing a disproportionate impact from VBP. We have five major categories impacted through tenders in 2023 in electrophysiology, trauma, spine, endocutters and energy, and more recently, IOLs and sports in our Orthopaedics business. We do believe that this will be a headwind through the remainder of '24 and into '25. That said, we are absolutely confident that China continues and will continue to be an important part of our portfolio. Even with the impact of VBP, we believe we can deliver tremendous growth and returns for our shareholders. And I think this really talks to the strength of our global portfolio across medtech, the fact that we can offset headwinds in one geography with better performance in places like Europe and the U.S. Please rest assured, we also believe that this part of the world, especially in Asia Pacific, will continue to be a growth opportunity. And let me tell you why. 60% of the world's patients live in that part of the world. And we're proud of the fact that we've been in many of these markets many, many years and expect to continue to do so. The final point I'll make is, let's remember, while, this is a headwind for MedTech, this is not material to Johnson & Johnson. When we look at our global sales across Johnson & Johnson, less than 5% of our business is in China. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the immunology side, just on TREMFYA and STELARA. So, you mentioned the U.S. sales for both those products were a little bit lighter. And we were expecting and you mentioned this unfavorable patient mix impact in the quarter. So, I'm just curious if you can just go in a little more detail on what you're seeing for those products in the U.S. specifically. And is this patient mix issue sort of this quarter? Is it adjustments from prior quarters? And is it something specific to Johnson & Johnson, or is it maybe something broader to the immunology market? Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Yeah, Vamil. If you talk about with patient mix, this would be something that is specific to some of the true-ups that we do. As you are all aware, we end up having to make an assessment on our gross to net reduction. And as we get final bills in, there always are some true-ups. Sometimes they're for the positive, sometimes it is a negative reduction. So, when we refer to patient mix, this is different patients coming through different channels as well as some of the accounting true-ups for the final payments that we make. Then, I will hand it over to Jennifer to specifically talk about the performance and the commercial perspective of TREMFYA and STELARA in the U.S.\nJennifer Taubert: And I think -- so if we look for TREMFYA, outside the U.S., really nice growth at 27%. In the U.S., it was a little over 9% specifically for that patient mix issue that Jess just spoke about. We do think that the prospects are very strong for continued TREMFYA growth based on what I articulated before around the launches in ulcerative colitis and the upcoming launches that we're planning for in Crohn's disease as well. I think for STELARA, we did see a decline and that, again, sort of similar patient mix piece in the U.S. We've also -- and also we've noted the decline ex U.S., particularly in EMEA due to biosimilar competition. We know that STELARA is near or at its end of life and really that TREMFYA and across the rest of our portfolio, we've got a very robust stable of products with pretty significant growth.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Vamil. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nJayson Bedford: Good morning. Maybe just a question for either Tim or Joe. Appreciate the color on MedTech, but the 5% bogey for the year still implies a decent acceleration in 4Q off a tougher comp. What gets better in 4Q? And then, just a quick clarification. The IV solutions dynamic from Helene, are you seeing an impact on volumes outside of Western North Carolina and Florida? Thanks.\nTim Schmid: Jayson, thank you for the question. And let me hit the last one first. No, we have seen the majority of the impact in the areas impacted by that storm. As I mentioned earlier, I think the watch out is any potential impact from additional shortage of IV fluid, which may impact elective procedures, and certainly, we're continuing to monitor that very carefully. As Joe mentioned, we expect now on the back of the headwinds we mentioned earlier in Asia Pacific to deliver adjusted operational growth of around 5% and north of 6% on an operational basis for the year. We believe that the momentum we're carrying into the fourth quarter, especially in our Cardiovascular businesses with our winning portfolio in electrophysiology, strong double-digit growth in Shockwave, Abiomed, I mean, those are, as you can see from the performance, absolute home runs. The other important dynamic here is that, as we signaled in the first and second quarter, we expect to see improvement within our Vision business, which typically has delivered solid single -- mid-single-digit growth. We had a tremendous third quarter, which really gives us confidence in even stronger fourth. This was delivered by much better performance, especially in our contact lens business. In fact, here in the U.S., our most important market, double-digit growth for contact lenses in the quarter. And this just really has been delivered from a stabilization of our distributor inventory in the U.S., the fact that we're able to get back to taking new wearer share now that we have unconstrained supply, especially within our astig portfolio. And so, we do believe that Vision has a very strong quarter ahead. And then finally, across the portfolio, we're benefiting from tremendous new product launches, both within Cardiovascular, the E8 peripheral catheter within Shockwave, continued performance within Abiomed with our broad portfolio of pumps. And then, within our surgery business as well as orthopaedics, as I mentioned earlier, tremendous new products to add differentiation to the portfolio. And typically, that fourth quarter also is a stronger one for us. So, once again, very confident in our performance at around 5% on an adjusted basis and north of 6% operationally. Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Jayson, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I would now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As you have heard, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our high-innovation and high-growth portfolio and pipelines are advancing rapidly, and we are increasingly confident in our expectations for 2025 and beyond. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And then, within our surgery business as well as orthopaedics, as I mentioned earlier, tremendous new products to add differentiation to the portfolio. And typically, that fourth quarter also is a stronger one for us. So, once again, very confident in our performance at around 5% on an adjusted basis and north of 6% operationally. Thank you."

            "name": "John Reed",
            "content": "Yeah, thanks. The 2113 is really moving along nicely. As you know, this is our targeted oral peptide, a very exquisite, elegantly designed molecule that binds to and blocks the IL-23 receptor, and it is orally available with once-daily dosing. The psoriasis indication is fully enrolled now, four Phase 3 studies, which are quite broad and include head to heads against TYK2 inhibitors as well as both adult and adolescent patients as well as a study in patients that have disease affecting hard-to-treat areas, scalp and other parts of the anatomy that can be very difficult to clear typically. So, we're really looking quite comprehensively there, and the data will be rolling out in the next few months. So, we look forward to sharing those at the appropriate time. In inflammatory bowel disease, we're in a signal-seeking Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis where we're exploring different doses before moving into more advanced studies, given that the IL-23 pathway is well validated inflammatory bowel disease. Thanks to STELARA and TREMFYA, we're quite confident that those studies will come through for us, but we'll wait for those data later this year to see how that oral medication is faring there. The other thing I'd maybe mention just in case it's not on your radar is we also have a co-antibody approach, we call it 4804, where gus and gol, TREMFYA and our TNF inhibitor are combined for patients tend to be on the more refractory side. And we're in the middle of inflammatory bowel disease studies there that will read out next year. So, really excited about that antibody combination as well. So altogether, the immunology portfolio is really quite robust and particularly in inflammatory bowel disease in the areas of dermatology where we've had traditional strengths. Maybe just a couple of things to highlight as well. With TEC, that is not only the first-in-class BCMA-targeting T-cell engager, but the data really showed also is best-in-class relative to other molecules in that -- of that type. The deepest responses -- complete response rates are approaching 50%, about half of patients. Duration of response is nearly two years, and very low discontinuation rates, less than 5%, showing the weight-adjusted dosing where we can really optimize for the patients, it's really playing out there. Very excited about the early data we're seeing when we combine TEC with dara, where we're seeing really high response rates in patients who have been multiply treated and now in Phase 3 studies in patients with one to three prior lines. And then, similar story with TAL. That is a B-cell preserving target, as you know. So, there are fewer risks of severe infections with TAL. And it has shown in the late line, the highest overall response rates of any T-cell engager bispecific for myeloma. So, we think there's a lot of upside opportunity there. And again, the data in combo with dara are really impressive. So, we're marching along with that combination and where we can have the benefits of both the T cell engager together with the CD38 class. And really only J&J is positioned to do that."

Judge Lopez last week on Thursday, after ruling that the case properly and appropriately should remain in Texas, ordered the parties to meet and confer and agree to a schedule for the expeditious resolution of the case. And by that, it means setting forth a schedule to get through to the confirmation procedure, addressing any ancillary motions, whether the motions to dismiss or issues relating to the votes. And the parties are in that process. We contemplate putting forth a schedule that resolves those issues through the end of the year for a confirmation hearing sometime at the beginning of next year.

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thank you, Jess, and hello, everyone. As you will hear, we delivered strong results in the third quarter with 6.3% operational sales growth. Our performance, once again, reflects the unique breadth of our business and our commitment to delivering the next wave of healthcare innovation to patients around the world. It also reflects the work we have done to shift our pipeline and portfolio to high innovation and high growth markets. That work continues, which you saw with the recently completed acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx, Proteologix and NM26 bispecific antibody in Innovative Medicine. And we are pleased with the progress we are making. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a second consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 11 key brands growing double-digits. DARZALEX became the first product in our portfolio to reach $3 billion in sales in a single quarter. And as you will hear, our pipeline of high innovation, high growth potential assets is advancing rapidly with five major U.S. and EC approvals in the quarter. This includes FDA approval of RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE as first line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer, a transformational step forward for patients, and FDA approval of TREMFYA for active ulcerative colitis, which represents a significant opportunity for Johnson & Johnson, given 75% of STELARA sales today come from inflammatory bowel disease. And with filings and reviews underway for many of our innovative medicines that have the potential to generate $5 billion in peak year sales, we are increasingly confident in our near- and long-term growth trajectory. In MedTech, you can see the impact of our portfolio shift to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, we are now category leaders in four of the largest and highest growth cardiovascular intervention medtech markets, which in Q3 translated to another quarter of double-digit growth across the Cardiovascular portfolio. And with the full market launch of Shockwave E8 peripheral IVL catheter, we are seeing an immediate impact of the Shockwave acquisition. In Vision, growth is accelerating, and we expect that to continue with the recent full market release of TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S. and ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day contact lenses. We are also excited about the future of our surgery business. As you will recall, in November 2023, we committed to submitting the OTTAVA robotic surgical system for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2024 to initiate clinical trials. I'm pleased to announce that we have met that milestone with the IDE application submitted in Q3. Looking across the enterprise, our high innovation, high growth strategy is working and our progress this quarter speaks to the strength of our commercial and innovation capabilities. We have increased adjusted operational EPS guidance pre-M&A for the third quarter in a row. We have invested $18 billion in high innovation, high growth M&A this year. Based on this quarter's results, we are confident in our expectations for 2025 through the end of the decade and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call back to Jess. Yeah, thank you, Chris. And as you have heard me before, our intention with respect to the talc litigation is to bring a responsible, final and comprehensive resolution to these claims. And we are making meaningful progress to do just that. We have filed our pre-packaged reorganization plan with the support of 83% of the claimants. And also, we have had a decision of the court to keep the filing in Houston. So, as I said, we are making progress in this resolution that I refer. As far as next steps, Erik? Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As you have heard, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our high-innovation and high-growth portfolio and pipelines are advancing rapidly, and we are increasingly confident in our expectations for 2025 and beyond. Enjoy the rest of your day."

            "name": "Jennifer Taubert",
            "content": "Hi. Louise. It's Jennifer. And good morning, everyone. And I wanted to start off by having a chance to really recognize and thank all my Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for fabulous quarter in the third quarter. We really continue to deliver against our strategy with 11 key brands having double-digit growth and achieving a few really notable milestones, notably the TREMFYA approval and launch in ulcerative colitis, also RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in first line non-small cell lung cancer, and we also completed the acquisition of NM26, which is a Phase 2-ready asset for atopic dermatitis. So, as we take a look at the immunology portfolio, we're really excited about TREMFYA, what we see as the prospects ahead. I just mentioned that we got approval during the quarter for that product in ulcerative colitis. We believe we truly have a winning proposition for that asset in IBD. And it's off to a really nice start with a good -- a really strong reception amongst the medical community. And we see that product having a lot of strength because it's the only dual act of IL-23. So, it blocks both IL-23 and the CD64 receptor cells. It really sets what we believe is a new bar in terms of efficacy with the highest rate of endoscopic normalization. And we've got rigorous head-to-head data versus STELARA showing superiority in Crohn's disease. And we think that we've got unrivaled flexibility and what will ultimately be a subcu both induction and maintenance dose for TREMFYA. So, TREMFYA was $4 billion in sales for the quarter. And that was really on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis alone. When we take a look going forward and what we had seen with STELARA in terms of the strength in IBD and the potential, we think that TREMFYA definitely is an asset that is STELARA size or bigger and better. So, a lot of exciting opportunity for us ahead. For 2113, we're really excited about our oral asset that we're developing. And I'll let John Reed, my colleague, John Reed, actually talk about why we're so excited about it and some of the data -- upcoming data there, but we do think that being able to have that advanced efficacy and known safety profile in a simple oral tablet is not only going to be great for the existing biologics' appropriate patients, but we think it gives us a great market expansion opportunity moving into earlier lines of therapy as well. John? We really do think that we've got a winning portfolio for inflammatory bowel diseases. And maybe just one addition because I know we've had questions on this in the past on 2113, we're going to be developing that really across the spectrum, so both ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease. So, we're starting off in ulcerative colitis, but absolutely have plans to develop it in Crohn's as well. Hi, Terence, thanks so much for the question on multiple myeloma. And I won't go into a lot of detail on DARZALEX, but it's worth noting that we had $3 billion in sales, more than 20% growth. And DARZALEX really continues to perform quite strongly for us as we continue to grow share, particularly in frontline, in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients. I really appreciate the question on CARVYKTI. So, $286 million in sales, 88% growth year-over-year and 53% quarter-over-quarter. And we're really seeing that continued growth for a number of reasons. So first, we're seeing very strong demand based on the CARTITUDE-4 approval for that second-line-and-beyond patients. In addition, overall survival data was just presented for CARVYKTI in this line, which was very, very significant and further adds to the importance of this medicine for patients with multiple myeloma. And the other aspect is we continue to progress really nicely with our continued capacity expansion, both in terms of number of slots per day in Raritan, we gained approval for our Ghent manufacturing site in Europe for commercial production, that is now underway and able to serve patients, and our CMO in the United States as well is producing on the clinical end. And so, all the way around from performance of the product from new data as well as continued capacity expansion, we continue to see very strong performance for CARVYKTI. And as we discussed before, I don't know that we will see that as a complete exact linear growth curve quarter-to-quarter simply because the capacity expansion works in a bit more of a stair-step fashion, but as we have discussed, second quarter for us being definitely more robust than the first half, that's playing through. And I think if you think about that going forward, that makes a lot of sense. And we're over 4,200 patients now with CARVYKTI, and it is the most successful CAR-T launch for across -- throughout the industry across all CAR-Ts. Then last, you asked about TECVAYLI and talquetamab. So, if we take a look at -- start off basically with TEC. So, TEC sales were $135 million and 21% growth for the quarter, but it was flat sequentially. We're seeing really nice uptake in the market in terms of new patients. There's also a dynamic where physicians are treating with longer treatment durations. So, we do think that there's a lot of continued growth and expansion for the product. It's performing very well for patients and not only in its current lines of therapy, but we're also taking a look and studying it in combinations, whether with DARZALEX, whether with TAL. And so, we do believe that there's a lot of growth potential on there. For TALVEY, we're not reporting out the sales yet. I think we'll start on that probably next year. But both TAL and TEC, we continue to expand not only with the academic, but also out into the community setting. And so, we think there's a lot of growth ahead. And I think -- so if we look for TREMFYA, outside the U.S., really nice growth at 27%. In the U.S., it was a little over 9% specifically for that patient mix issue that Jess just spoke about. We do think that the prospects are very strong for continued TREMFYA growth based on what I articulated before around the launches in ulcerative colitis and the upcoming launches that we're planning for in Crohn's disease as well. I think for STELARA, we did see a decline and that, again, sort of similar patient mix piece in the U.S. We've also -- and also we've noted the decline ex U.S., particularly in EMEA due to biosimilar competition. We know that STELARA is near or at its end of life and really that TREMFYA and across the rest of our portfolio, we've got a very robust stable of products with pretty significant growth."

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. In the third quarter, Johnson & Johnson delivered results that illustrate not only the breadth of the business, but our ability to consistently beat financial expectations. Innovative Medicine continued to build on strong first-half revenue momentum. We are advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline, achieving significant clinical and regulatory milestones across key therapeutic areas. Our MedTech business, with the addition of Shockwave, delivered operational growth of 6.4% in the quarter, but did experience headwinds in the Asia Pacific region. We continue to fortify our future advancing the OTTAVA robotic surgery system to IDE, expanding VELYS use and launching new intraocular lenses. Due to dynamics in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, we are taking a responsibly conservative approach by assuming no material improvement in that part of the business for the remainder of this year. And as such, we expect MedTech adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2024 to be closer to 5% versus the 6% we referenced last quarter. The strength of a diversified business enables us to more than offset volatility in one part of our business, but yet be in a position to once again increase 2024 guidance for the enterprise. Before diving into the results, I'll take a moment to touch on some enterprise-wide updates from the quarter. We are making progress towards resolving talc litigation. Our pre-packaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from the current claimants of roughly 83% as well as the future claimants representative. As announced last Thursday, the case will be heard in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. And while we remain committed to bringing this matter to a resolution, it would be premature to speculate on timing. In addition to the pipeline highlights Joaquin mentioned, there are some additional notable advancements throughout the quarter. In oncology, we received U.S. and EU regulatory approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy as a second line treatment for adults with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. With FDA priority review underway for a subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT, along with data supporting a treatment regimen to reduce adverse events, we are building a best-in-class EGFR portfolio. We also presented Phase 1 data for RYBREVANT with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, extending the asset's potential beyond lung cancer. In multiple myeloma, we advanced our leadership position with FDA approval and filing of two DARZALEX FASPRO quad-based regimens for newly diagnosed patients. With CARVYKTI, we announced three-year follow-up data showing significantly extended overall survival and gained approval for commercial production at our Ghent facility, further expanding supply capacity. Finally, in oncology, we added to the growing evidence base for our TARIS platform with positive Phase 2b data in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and positive interim to Phase 2 data in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. In neuroscience, we submitted to the U.S. and European regulatory bodies for what would be the first global approval of nipocalimab for the treatment of people living with generalized myasthenia gravis. For the remainder of the year, we expect approval of TREMFYA subcu for Crohn's disease and data readouts on JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ-4804, our co-antibody therapeutic for inflammatory bowel disease, aticaprant for adjunctive major depressive disorder and nipocalimab for rheumatoid arthritis. In MedTech, we completed enrollment of the Omny-IRE clinical trial to evaluate safety and effectiveness in mapping and treating symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during standard ablation procedures. Also in Cardiovascular, we are preparing for the anticipated approval of VARIPULSE in the U.S. and the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. In Orthopaedics, we launched several exciting new products in the U.S., including our VELYS SPINE robot and VOLT Plating System. The plentiful pipeline progress across our businesses will ensure continued success. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $14 billion compared to $12 billion last year, which included eight months contribution from the Consumer Health business. We ended the third quarter with $20 billion of cash and marketable securities and $36 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $16 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our strong balance sheet enables us to strategically invest to grow our business while simultaneously returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. During the quarter, we invested nearly $5 billion in research and development. This is an increase over 2023 levels even after excluding acquired in-process R&D expense. Thus far in 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $18 billion for strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements, which includes the recent acquisition of V-Wave, another innovative treatment in heart failure, which closed last week. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are increasing our adjusted operational sales guidance. We now expect growth in the range of 5.7% to 6.2% with a midpoint of 6%. We are also increasing operational sales growth by $200 million to a range of 6.3% to 6.8% with a midpoint of $89.6 billion or 6.6%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of $1.10, slightly above last quarter's guidance. This results in an estimated incremental positive foreign currency impact of $200 million, reducing our previous full-year negative impact to $1 billion. As such, we expect reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6% with a midpoint of $88.6 billion or 5.4%. Regarding the rest of the P&L, with the addition of the V-Wave transaction, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting and related R&D investment, we would be on track to improve operating margins by 50 basis points, which is consistent with what we guided to at the beginning of the year. As we strive to advance and accelerate our pipeline, you can anticipate elevated levels of investment in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is now projected to be between $450 million and $550 million, $150 million greater than our previous guidance. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, an increase versus previous guidance, driven by the one-time monetization of royalty rights, which Jessica referenced, that will be utilized for that higher Q4 investment I referenced a moment ago. Our effective tax rate, consistent with previous guidance, is expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full year. Similar to last quarter, we have provided an EPS bridge to outline the impact from acquisition activity throughout the year. Before the impact of the V-Wave acquisition, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again increasing. As the schedule reflects, we are expecting an incremental $0.10 per share increase on our operational performance for a total increase of $0.18 per share for the year. On this basis, when excluding acquisition activity throughout the year, EPS growth is 9.2%. To account for the completion of the V-Wave transaction, as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per share in 2025. Combined, this yields an updated 2024 adjusted operational EPS guidance of $9.91 at the midpoint of the range, basically flat year-on-year despite absorbing approximately $0.92 of acquisition activity. While not predicting the impact of currency movements utilizing the recent exchange rates just referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year positive impact of $0.02 per share. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.93 at the midpoint. We are still finalizing our plans for next year, but let me provide you some preliminary qualitative commentary to inform your modeling for 2025. For Innovative Medicine, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver growth despite a significant LOE resulting in sales above the $57 billion commitment we stated in 2021. This will be driven by our end market brands and continued progress from our recently launched products, including TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding the STELARA LOE, we are planning for biosimilar entries in the U.S. in January, assuming that HUMIRA's erosion curve is a relatively good proxy for your models. We continue to expect a negative impact associated with the Part D redesign. In our pipeline, we anticipate data readouts across all our priority platforms: anticipated approvals of TREMFYA subcu in Crohn's disease, RYBREVANT subcu for lung cancer and nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis, as well as potential filings for TARIS in bladder cancer and aticaprant in major depressive disorder. As a reminder, TREMFYA, RYBREVANT and TARIS continue to be the three largest underappreciated assets in terms of our revenue projections versus what analysts are estimating for the back half of this decade. For MedTech, we continue to expect to deliver on our long-term objective identified at last year's Enterprise Business Review of growing operational sales in the upper end of the 2022 through 2027 weighted average market growth rate of 5% to 7%. We also expect continued adoption of newer products across all MedTech businesses, such as VARIPULSE in electrophysiology, VELYS enabling technology across Orthopaedics, Odyssey and PureSee in Surgical Vision and contributions from our Abiomed and Shockwave integration. Specific to volume-based pricing in China, we expect continued impacts from the rollout of the 2024 tenders in Orthopaedics sports and intraocular lenses and anticipate VBP to continue expanding across provinces and products. Moving to the rest of the P&L. When thinking about operating margin, there are pluses and minuses. Tailwinds include an anticipated reduction of acquired IPR&D expense year-over-year, continued focus on MedTech margin improvement and continued OpEx optimization benefits post the separation. Working against us is unfavorable product mix driven by STELARA biosimilar entrants and Part D redesign. With a brief look at your models last week, the consensus margin does not appear unreasonable, and we'll provide further clarity in January once we complete our 2025 plan. We do not expect to maintain the heightened levels of interest income due to a reduction in interest rates and impact from debt experienced in 2024 related to acquisition activity. Regarding other income and expense, we expect lower net other income due to the non-recurring nature of the monetization of royalty rights experienced in Q3, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, as well as income lost on the Kenvue dividend. Lastly, based on what we know today, under current tax law, we anticipate our 2025 tax rate to be slightly lower than our anticipated 2024 tax rate. To wrap up prior to Q&A, we are pleased with our underlying 2024 performance that simultaneously fortified a strong foundation for continued success heading into 2025. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to open the call for your questions."

Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our second quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.4 billion for the second quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.6%, with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and 5.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, sales growth was 7.2% worldwide and growth of 6.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.05 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.82, representing increases of 1.6% and 10.2%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2023. I'll now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $14.5 billion increased 7.8%, with growth of 8.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.8% worldwide and 8.7% outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21.3%, primarily driven by share gains of 4.6 points across all lines of therapy and 9.4 points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $186 million, with growth of 59.9%, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. TECVAYLI sales achieved $135 million in the quarter, with growth of 43.5%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed-refractory setting. Demand remained strong while sequential growth slowed due to adoption of recently approved longer-duration dosing intervals. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 32.5%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth in metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer. Other oncology growth was driven by continued strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 30.7%, driven by market growth, share gains in PSO and PSA, and favorable patient mix. STELARA growth of 4.9% was driven by market growth, partially offset by net unfavorable patient mix. We continue to anticipate biosimilar entry in Europe later this month, while in the U.S., we expect continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry in 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 60.8% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence. In pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 9.1% due to share gains and market growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix. UPTRAVI growth of 8.1% was driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by a decline in other neuroscience, unfavorable patient mix in Xarelto and competitive pressures in IMBRUVICA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $8 billion increased 4.4%, with growth in the U.S. of 5.7% and 3.2% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive impact of 40 basis points on sales growth in the quarter. Growth was driven by commercial execution, strength of new product introductions, and continued strong procedure volume, partially offset by performance in China and competitive pressures in US distributor stocking dynamics and vision. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered a double-digit growth of 13.4% with strong growth across all regions. The performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution, partially offset by the previous one-time inventory build in Asia-Pacific from the prior quarter. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15.4%, driven by double-digit growth in all regions and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Results include $77 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave, which closed on May 31. Contact lenses adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the Blink divestiture was 2.1%. Growth was driven by strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, partially offset by U.S. distributor stocking dynamics and competitive pressures, and Japan macroeconomic pressures. The Blink divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 130 basis points. Surgical vision grew 1.2%, driven by TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens, partially offset by China VBP and refractive softness in the U.S. Surgery adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the Acclarent divestiture was approximately flat. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, China VBP, prior year China recovery, EMEA tender timing across advanced surgery and supply constraints, and wound closure. This was partially offset by strength of new products. The Acclarent divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 110 basis points. Orthopedics growth of 3.3% was driven by strong performance in hips and knees, due to procedure growth, strength of new products, and EMEA tender timing in knees. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures and impacts of China VBP in spine and sports. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin deleveraged by 60 basis points, primarily driven by product mix within innovative medicine and macroeconomic factors across both sectors. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.7 billion or 18.8% of sales in innovative medicine, compared to 22.2% of sales in 2023. As a reminder, last year included an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the AbelZeta partnership. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.7 billion or 9% of sales, an increase driven by continued investment in strategic platforms. Other income and expense was a net expense of $653 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to income of $384 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in expense was primarily driven by costs related to the closing of the Shockwave acquisition, the loss on the completion of the debt for equity exchange of the retained stake in Kenvue and prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements in MedTech. This was partially offset by the gain on the Acclarent divestiture. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 18.5% versus 14.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by unfavorable one-time international audit settlements and the continued impact from Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second-quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 37.2% to 37.4%. Innovative Medicine margin improved from 42.3% to 44.6%, primarily driven by an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the AbelZeta partnership in 2023, partially offset by product mix and cost of products sold. MedTech margin declined from 28.2% to 25.7%, driven by prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements worth approximately 300 basis points. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Overall, Johnson & Johnson delivered solid top and bottom-line, as well as free cash flow growth in the quarter. Our Innovative Medicine business made great progress in the second quarter. We have strong momentum with key end-market products and continue to advance our pipeline with significant clinical and regulatory milestones being attained. Our MedTech business delivered growth that fell below our expectations of growing in the upper range of our markets, which as you recall correlates to a weighted-average market growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2022 through 2027. We came into the year thinking 2024 would be in the upper end of that range. With acceleration planned in the second-half, given some of the first-half dynamics Jessica outlined, we now expect growth closer to 6% for 2024. To me, this reflects the power and breadth of our company, where we can more than offset quarterly volatility in one part with overperformance from another part of our business. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to provide some qualitative business highlights from the quarter. Starting with innovative Medicine, in oncology, we continue to make meaningful progress across our disease areas of focus. Of note, we received FDA approval for CARVYKTI in earlier lines of therapy and reported positive top-line overall survival results from the CARTITUDE-4 study. We also submitted a filing with the FDA for our subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT. We presented updated results for TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we met primary endpoints for two DARZALEX studies, Cepheus and Aquila, where results will be presented at an upcoming major medical meeting. Turning to immunology, we achieved key milestones for TREMFYA in inflammatory bowel disease, including the presentation and filing of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as the filing of our subcutaneous formulation, which would make TREMFYA the only IL-23 inhibitor with a fully subcutaneous regimen. We also expanded our immunology portfolio with the acquisitions of Proteologix and NM26. These bispecific antibodies will further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our ability to address significant unmet need in atopic dermatitis. Finally, spanning immunology and neuroscience, we presented positive results for nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease and myasthenia gravis. But it doesn't stop with the second quarter. We are excited for what awaits in the second half of this year with the anticipated approval and launch of both RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline EGFR positive lung cancer and TREMFYA in IBD. We also expect data from JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ 4804, our co-antibody therapeutic in IBD and nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. As we continue to bring new innovations to market and execute against clinical and regulatory milestones, Innovative Medicine is well-positioned to achieve sustainable growth in both the near and long-term. Turning to MedTech, we continue to advance our pipeline, launch new commercial products and integrate strategic acquisitions that broaden and further differentiate our portfolio. In cardiovascular, we are enhancing our portfolio and shifting into higher growth markets through strategic acquisitions such as Shockwave Medical. In May, we announced the launch of our CARTO 3 Version 8 electroanatomical mapping system. This is the latest version of our 3D heart mapping system, which has machine learning capabilities that increase efficiency, reproducibility, and accuracy in maps electrophysiologists use to treat atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. In pulsed field ablation, we initiated the commercial launch of the VARIPULSE platform in the EU and Japan receiving early positive physician feedback in the external evaluation period. We also delivered results from the pivotal phase of the admIRE trial, where the VARIPULSE platform demonstrated 85% peak primary effectiveness with minimal adverse events, short PFA application times and low fluoroscopy exposure. In orthopedics, we received 510(k) FDA clearance for the clinical application of the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. This is designed for both medial and lateral procedures enabling surgeons to guide precise implant placement without a CT scan. In surgery, we launched the ECHELON 3000 in the U.S., which combines 3D stapling and gripping surface technology to enable greater staple line security. This has been shown to deliver 47% fewer leaks, reduce surgical risks and improve surgical outcomes. In surgical vision, we launched TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and head into a full market launch in the second-half of 2024. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology and cardiovascular pipelines as we prepare for the anticipated U.S. approval of VARIPULSE, as well as the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. Within robotic surgery, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for OTTAVA in the second-half of the year. Before turning to cash flow and guidance, I wanted to provide an update on the talc litigation. As announced on May 1, the company has committed to pay ovarian claimants a present value of approximately $6.5 billion or $8 billion nominally over 25-years, resulting 99.75% of all pending talc lawsuits against the company and its affiliates in the United States. We are currently in a voting period for the plan, where for the first time, claimants are able to vote for themselves for or against the plan. The last day of voting is scheduled for July 26. It will then take a few weeks for the vote administrator to vet and tally the votes. Once that process concludes, we plan to make a public announcement on the next steps regarding a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. Our confidence that we will reach the requisite 75% vote is bolstered by the continued support of council representing the vast majority of claimants with whom the plan was developed, as well as the announcement of support by additional prominent plaintiff law firms recently, including Ailstock, Keller Postman, and Miller. Additionally, in furtherance of our goal of achieving a comprehensive solution, we finalized the previously announced agreements reached with all states that advanced talc claims in the Imerys and Cyprus entities, owners of the mines that supplied talc to the company. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress with mesothelioma claimants with 95% of claimants now settled. Turning to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $41 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $7.5 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in the prior year period, which included cash flow from the Consumer Health business. During the quarter, we exited our retained stake in Kenvue, bringing the separation to a close. The net proceeds from the secondary offering were $3.6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We maintain a strong balance sheet, which continues to enable us to strategically invest in and grow our business, while returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. In the second quarter, we invested more than $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales in research and development. In terms of acquisitions and licensing, during the first half of 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $17 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities. This includes Shockwave, Proteologix and the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction announced last week, as well as more than 20 other smaller complementary business development transactions. While we will always explore strategic deals of any size that can create value, we foresee modest tuck-in deals as the preferred route over the near-term. Now turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Given the moving parts associated with the acquisitions this quarter, I'll start where I usually end with earnings per share. Before the impact of recent acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again being increased. As this schedule reflects, we are expecting a $0.05 per share increase in our operational performance. This would result in year-over-year EPS growth of 8.2% at the midpoint. To account for the completion of Shockwave, Proteologix, and the NM26 bispecific antibody transactions, and as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.68 per share. Combined, all of this yields an updated adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of $10 to $10.10 per share. In addition to assist with your future models, these transactions are expected to have a smaller impact of $0.33 to adjusted operational EPS in 2025. Now to address all elements of P&L guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full-year by $500 million to reflect the completion of the Shockwave acquisition. We now expect growth in the range of 6.1% to 6.6% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $89.4 billion or 6.4% at the midpoint. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 5.5% to 6.0% compared to 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. We are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.08, consistent with last quarter. However, there have been notable strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, specifically the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. As a result, we estimate an incremental negative foreign currency impact of $500 million, resulting in a full-year impact of $1.2 billion. As such, combined with the Shockwave acquisition, we expect reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2%, compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% growth. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Based solely on the dilution from the transactions, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by 120 basis points, more than offsetting the previously communicated 50 basis point improvement. We projected net interest income between $300 million and $400 million, lower than previous guidance driven by interest expense associated with financing of our recent acquisitions. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, an increase versus previous guidance driven by year-to-date performance. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full-year, much higher than 2023, largely due to the impact of OECD Pillar 2, as well as the non-deductible nature of the recently announced NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. We continue to expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe beginning the last week of July. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. While we had COVID-19 vaccine sales in the second quarter, we do not anticipate any future sales. Finally, it is worth noting that distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in the fourth quarter. In preparation for this transfer, we expect limited third-quarter sales in Europe. Turning to MedTech, as previously stated, we expect growth to accelerate back in line with our long-term expectations in the second-half of the year. This will be driven by recovery in contact lenses, evidenced by sequential monthly improvement within Q2. Further expansion into high-growth segments, including the integration of Shockwave and continued growth of new products and commercial execution across the portfolio. As you think about our adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect it to be higher in the first-half of the year, compared to the second-half. Again, this is due to the IP R&D charge for the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction in Q3 as well as the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe later this month. Lastly, as a reminder on share count, we only expect a partial benefit in the third quarter resulting from the share count reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer in August of 2023 with the fourth quarter being neutral. As we move forward, we remain focused on advancing our differentiated portfolio and achieving key clinical and regulatory milestones across Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained growth and long-term value for patients, customers, and shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin for concluding remarks before taking your questions.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. With a strong second quarter, I'm excited about the rest of 2024. Our Innovative Medicine business is on track for a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth. Our success is driven by a portfolio of innovative best and first-in-class medicines, many of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Across the board, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, we are reinventing treatment paradigms and transforming lives. As Joe mentioned, we have made significant progress across our pipeline. In particular, I would like to highlight two major milestones on the horizon that will help drive sustained growth through 2025 and beyond. First, the approval and launch of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib for first-line treatment of EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And second, the approval and launch of TREMFYA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD, which follows the recent presentation of data that demonstrated superiority versus STELARA. This represents a meaningful opportunity for TREMFYA as approximately 75% of STELARA sales today come from IBD. We also have regulatory and data milestones for many of the assets that we expect to generate more than $5 billion in peak year sales. As the pipeline and portfolio progress, so too does our confidence in our near and long-term growth trajectory. We are confident in our ability to grow through the upcoming STELARA biosimilar entry and see accelerating momentum through the back half of the decade. In MedTech, year-to-date adjusted operational sales growth of 5.2% reflects continued progress with the portfolio as we move into higher growth markets. As you heard from Joe, we expect MedTech growth to accelerate in the second-half of the year. Growth will accelerate through continued expansion of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS Max 1-Day Contact Lenses, TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and VARIPULSE in Europe and Japan. Our confidence in the business outlook remains unchanged. With meaningful outcomes from the danger shock trial in Abiomed and the second quarter close of the shockwave acquisition, we look forward to continue the expansion into high-growth MedTech markets. As you know, Johnson & Johnson is laser-focused on advancing the next wave of medical innovation. We are building on a strong foundation to unlock accelerated growth with a healthy balance sheet and industry-leading investments in the best science and innovation. This enables us to move into the second-half of 2024 from a position of strength. With that, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just a question on RYBREVANT. I know, Joaquin, you mentioned that as one of the key upcoming milestones for the company, but this does seem like a product where there's a disconnect between J&J's enthusiasm in the Street. So, maybe just enlighten us with some of the data we recently saw at ASCO on subcutaneous dosing, et cetera, the upcoming label expansion? Can you just talk about how you see RYBREVANT evolving overtime and your confidence that this product can take share in the frontline setting? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Hi, Chris, it's Jennifer and thanks so much for the question. Real quick before I get into that one, I just wanted to give a quick shout-out to all my internal Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a terrific quarter. Our first $14 billion-plus quarter that we hit in over 10 products with double-digit growth. So, really, really a tremendous quarter and looking-forward to a great half of the year as well. So, we are very excited about RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib and the data that we're seeing and really believe that it's going to have a significant place in frontline non-small cell lung cancer. As we've discussed before, there is a significant unmet need in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with about a quarter of patients never even making it to second-line therapy. So, a lot of patients that are there with high unmet medical need. When we take a look at the data that we've been able to generate in terms of PFS and when you add to that, the new data that we brought forward on our subcu dosing, we think together, we're going to have a really winning combination for patients in that frontline setting. So, high unmet need, really spectacular results that we're seeing and the subcu dosing we think is going to be a great combination.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, maybe we can do a deeper dive into MedTech. Just talk about what drove the reduction in the expected growth for MedTech in 2024? And how are you thinking about the Medtech end-markets in the second half and which J&J businesses do you see improving in the second-half and why? Thank you.\nTim Schmid: Larry, thank you for the question. Let me be very clear, we remain absolutely committed to delivering solid growth in the full-year for 2024. And Larry, when you actually look at \u201824 Q2, it was a tougher quarter for us. And we knew this, given the fact that at this time last year around the second quarter, we saw the opening up of the China market, which as you know is an important market for us and that was expected. That was actually by the way, last year our fastest-growing quarter. Now in all transparency, as you heard initially in the comments earlier, there have been two businesses that have or two areas of our business that have performed below expectations. Number one is Vision and secondly, our performance in China, which right now is a very volatile market. Now in Vision, we initially announced in the first quarter some challenges with distributor stocking dynamics here in the U.S., some competitive pressures, as well as some macroeconomic challenges in Japan. What gives me confidence in the turnaround of that business is that we actually saw sequential improvement through the second quarter. Some of those stocking dynamic dynamics I mentioned bled into April, but month-on-month, we saw strong rebound of that business, in fact, to the end of the quarter back to historical levels. And so as we look to the back half of the year, while it's been a slower start there, we're very confident that we're going to be able to bring that business back to historical norms, driven primarily by innovation. Our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX portfolio and that global launch as well as the addition of our premium IOLs with TECNIS PureSee in Asia-Pac and EMEA as well as Odyssey here in the U.S., and so we believe we've got that under control. When I look to the back half onto answer your question more directly, the reason we are confident is firstly, not only the return to more normalized growth within Vision, but in surgery, by the way, that -- all that business also was impacted by a slower start, especially in China. We see that starting to normalize. And also remember in our surgery business, the results were impacted by the divestiture of a Acclarent last year. And so normalized growth -- our adjusted operational growth was actually closer to flat. We see that continuing to grow at low-single-digit through the back half of the year. We're proud of the solid results in ortho and see that continuing to be driven by strong results within hip 6%, in knees, almost 10%, driven by tremendous innovation, especially in VELYS. And then more broadly, I'll end with our real confidence in the growth of our cardiovascular portfolio. And remember, Larry, that we've got an EP business that's $5 billion today, grew 21% last year, 19% for the first-half of the year. In fact, in the second quarter, in the face of competition, here in the U.S. we grew that business 16%. And so we're very confident in our ability to grow that leadership position. And then finally, the addition of Abiomed still continuing to grow ahead of our deal expectations, 15.4%. I think that's going to be bolstered by the landmark results, the first time in 25 years, where we have the DanGer Shock study showing survivability benefits of Impella, which will continue to open new markets for that portfolio. And then finally, I'll end with how delighted we are to inch very, very short order, welcome Shockwave to Johnson & Johnson. We closed that transaction in record timing and are really excited by the fact that we will shortly announce that they will be the 13th business with sales in excess of $1 billion annually. And so for all those reasons, Larry, while a tougher second year -- second quarter primarily due to comps, we remain very confident in a solid 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Wanted to ask you about your Phase III nipocalimab data that you presented recently. And how do you compare and contrast the efficacy and durability of your product versus other FcRns and mechanisms of actions on the market? Thank you.\nJohn Reed: Yes, John Reed here. Thanks for that question. Well, we're really excited about the data in Sjogren's with nipocalimab. It's the data we delivered shows really sustained disease control, which is so important by our dosing regimen as compared to some of the intermittent dosing regimens used by others. And the consistent efficacy we've seen across all primary, secondary endpoints, et cetera, is really compelling as a guess that we may be on the first advanced therapy for Sjogren's that disease has ever seen. As you know, that's a very prevalent disorder affecting its estimated 4 million people around the world, perhaps 1 million in the United States, 90% of the people impacted are women right in the prime of life. So, we're really excited about the possibility of bringing forward the first advanced therapy for that disorder.\nJessica Moore: Maybe I can add-in a couple of things on as well because we're really excited by what we're seeing from all the data that's coming out. And over the last 18 months, we've demonstrated clinical effect in actually four auto-antibody driven diseases and we are the only FcRn blocker that's in development where we've got proof-of-concept in all three segments of auto-antibody driven diseases from rare auto-antibody to prevalent room to maternal fetal. So as we take a look at all the data that's coming forward as we're bringing this to market, we are even more confident -- in terms of confidence that this is a $5 billion-plus asset for us. Operator Our next question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nRick Wise: Good morning, everybody. If I could talk a little bit about the EP business. Obviously, this is the first full quarter where we're really seeing a broader launch of a competitive PFA system. You updated us on your system. But maybe if you could give us more color broadly on the impact you're seeing on EP growth and the outlook for the second-half, and help us better understand how this launch and the lot of CARTO 3 version 8 launch is being affected here. I\u2019m assuming mapping growth was strong, but maybe -- I don't know, maybe the catheter business was pressured by the competitive system. Can you help give us that macro color and maybe the specific impact on Biosense Webster. Thank you.\nTim Schmid: Of course, Rick and thank you for the question. And Rick, I'd start with firstly, recognizing that we believe that PFA is really good for electrophysiology and really good for patients. It is a tailwind for the entire market. And as I mentioned earlier, that's a $5 billion market for us today, growing 19% year-to-date. And let me be clear, we clearly see some competition, especially here in the U.S., especially between now and the time that we bring our PFA technology to market, we're confident. While we don't control the timing, we expect to have that by the end of the year or early next year. As you know, we already have and are commercializing our PFA technology in EMEA and in Japan, and we are very fortunate to actually benefit from a very global EP business. What gives us confidence in the future, Larry, is that we believe that while PFA has a role to play in the portfolio, so does RF. From everything we're hearing from EPs around the world, what they like about PFA is the relative safety of the technology, but they also like about RF, which by the way, we have 20-years of leadership in safety and clinical efficacy, is the durability of that product. In fact, even today, Rick, here in the U.S., for every five procedures where PFA is used, RF is used in conjunction. And so we believe that leisure position that we built over the last 20-years will continue, both in RF and then obviously, we're excited by the launch of our PFA technology. You'll know that at the HRS conference in May, we announced the results of our admIRE study, which showed the 86% relative effectiveness -- primary effectiveness of our PFA technology. And we are going to continue to employ the same strategy we did in RF, which is building out a broad portfolio of PFA offerings, both in dual energy, focal, large focal and single shot. Did you know that today, the number one used catheter on the market is our SPF catheter within RF. And we are -- and you'll know that in the second -- first quarter of this year, we announced a application for a CE mark for our dual energy catheter. This will be one catheter used, both for RF and PFA technology. And so we've got a lot of reasons to believe. And I think to touch on your point on CARTO, one of the benefit of our portfolios, not just our energy source and catheters, it really is the installed base of 5,500 CARTO systems around the world. We just version 8 of that software. It is best-in-class in the market. And that's also complemented by highly trained clinical specialists in every cath lab around the world who are supporting EPs each and every day. And so once again, PFA is a good thing for the marketplace, it's a tailwind and we expect to continue to benefit on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two parts for me on IRA. Was just wondering if you can offer any perspective on the impact of IRA negotiation STELARA and XARELTO as we're getting close to the disclosure of the pricing decision? And then also Part D redesign in 2025, just some high-level thoughts? And the second part of the question relates to your confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO will be looked at separately than DARZALEX just given the Hyaluronidase component there. Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert: Thanks so much for the question. I'll answer the second part first. We do have very good confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO is treated separately than DARZALEX IV. And so yes, we continue forward with that perspective on that. In terms of IRA and kind of what's been going on, if we take a look at Part D redesign, while we're not externally quantifying the impact at this time, what we can say is that we do anticipate a net unfavorable impact in 2025. However, as outlined at our enterprise business review last November, we do anticipate, as a business, growing 3% plus next year and then 5% to 7% out through 2030. And these numbers are actually already included in that guidance that we provided. Same thing as it pertains to the government price setting process, we are still in that. We have received the final numbers from the government, we're not disclosing that at this time. That will be disclosed in the September time frame. And while we are not in alignment with IRA and the price setting process, those numbers have been included in the guidance that we provided last year at EBR, that still looks very good to us today. It's very consistent today.\nJohn Reed: Since you mentioned, DARZALEX. John Reed here, I thought maybe I would just remind you that actually, in this quarter, we delivered four additional positive Phase III studies with DARZALEX across a number of indications, including transplant ineligible frontline, including in the maintenance setting, after transplant, including smoldering condition that is as large as the entirety of diagnostically defying myeloma and in amyloidosis. So the momentum continues with DARZALEX.\nJennifer Taubert: And we had 21% growth. $2.9 billion in sales and 21% growth. So yes, DARZALEX is our single largest asset now for the corporation.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just touch on MedTech and outlook for procedure volume trends in the back half. There have been some concerns that there's some tough comps on the utilization side and particularly for [Technical Difficulty] half? And then maybe also, if you could just touch on the pricing environment and your outlook for device pricing and where pricing stands for the MedTech portfolio? Thanks for taking the question.\nJoe Wolk: Sure, Josh. And I think my answer to your sort of volume question will be very brief and consistent with what we've shared before. For the most part, across the portfolio, we've seen volumes normalize. We did mention that we expected to see some of the -- some tailwinds from the backlog within Orthopedics in the first-half of the year. And we've seen that, but we expect that to normalize in the back half. We remain consistent in our belief in the 5% to 7% growth for our end markets and that we will perform well within that. As it relates to pricing, inflation has not been a friend to our industry, and we have put a lot of effort into really ensuring that we can secure preferential pricing across the world. I do think we benefit from the global nature of our business. While there are pockets cost containment efforts that we're managing, like VBP in China, we see tremendous opportunity to really secure a premium pricing, especially where we have differentiated innovation. And especially now that we're entering or are entering is like cardiovascular of significant unmet need, there is tremendous opportunities for us to ensure that we secure premium pricing for truly differentiated innovations, especially in areas like electrophysiology, in heart recovery with Abiomed, and more recently with Shockwave. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live.\nDave Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. Could you please comment on the J&J U.S. pharma exposure to efforts by plans to extract greater rebates in 2025 than in typical years in order to offset Part D plan losses in 2025? Thanks very much.\nJennifer Taubert: Thanks for the question on that. We're still in the process of working with all payers for the planned formularies and everything for 2025 and 2026. I think what's really most important is to go back to the guidance we provided at the EBR last year in November. And as we take a look at the corporation, we have factored in and anticipated what we think will happen. And as an organization, we feel very confident in the guidance of 3% plus growth in 2025, and really, importantly, that accelerating growth out through the end of the decade, the 5% to 7% growth.\nJoe Wolk: Dave, I'd also remind you too that over the last six years, and certainly a compliment to John, Jennifer and the team, that innovation really underscores the success that we've had with quarter in, quarter out performance in our Innovative Medicines business. Discounts and rebates six years ago, as compared to list price was only about 25% of that list price. Today, that number -- and this is not just the J&J number, but an industry number, gravitates towards 60%. So what we want to make sure that happens is this great innovation gets to patients and makes a difference in their lives and get them -- they have access through the discounting that we already provide.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick MedTech question on China. So China, it sounds like things are evolving in China. I mean this is no surprise to anyone. But just curious about how you guys are thinking about China as a contributor going forward given all the evolution in that market and some of the issues, VBP, things like that. How meaningful? I mean, it's been a big growth driver for you guys historically. How do we think about China going forward? And is the strategy for J&J, does it have to change to adapt to the evolving market there? Thanks so much.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Danielle, it's Joaquin. So we were one of the first companies that started to operate in China, and we've been in China for decades. So we have a history of having constructive engagements with China, and we are looking forward for that to continue. Now we recognize the situation and we have robust business continuity planning practices in place, and we are able to mitigate any potential exposure. But we continue to see China as an important growth driver, both for our Innovative Medicine business and also for our MedTech business. Specifically, you had some questions that Tim can address on MedTech and how we see our MedTech business in China moving forward.\nTim Schmid: Sure. And Danielle, we are fortunate to have a global business with more than 50% of our revenue already out of the U.S. And I think that gives us the flexibility to really manage a number of challenges that occur on a quarterly and yearly basis across the world. To Joaquin's point, we've been in China for 37-years. One of the reasons why we've been successful is our ongoing commitment in navigating multiple headwinds and opportunities. And when we look at our performance in China, remember, we had the end of COVID when we came out of lockdown, and so that has impacted the results in the second quarter. But when you look at on the ground, what's really happening is there's two factors. Firstly, you look at the impact of VBP, which is a government-driven cost containment effort. And given our leadership position in China, we are seeing that as a short-term tailwind. We do believe the volume opportunity will far offset over time the impact we're seeing on price, but that certainly is a short-term pain that we are enduring. That has also been exacerbated by the anticorruption campaign. You may know that in July of last year, the government initiated an anticorruption campaign, which actually has had an impact on both procedural volumes and engagement from health care professionals. Now I must reiterate that we see this as a really good thing. We believe that any effort on behalf of any government to really build integrity and compliance into the health system is a good thing for more fair competition and aligns with our credo and our commitment to compliance across all of the markets in which we participate in. So it's a short-term headwind, but long-term, really good for our industry and really good for J&J. We remain absolutely committed to China. And we will continue, as we always have, to navigate some of the challenges we have on the ground with pricing and geopolitical challenges, and we remain committed to the 1.4 billion patients who rely on us each and every day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. Together with my colleague, David Roman, a genuine question that we had related to the MedTech market dynamics and outlook. Can you help us better understand comments that were made about a fair amount of inventory destocking that's been happening and juxtapose that and perhaps reconcile with your expectation that the demand outlook would strengthen. We're just trying to put together this notion of inventory stocking, destocking ahead of an anticipated acceleration versus a potential deceleration or a tougher demand environment going forward? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nJoe Wolk: Thank you. It's a good question and the only area across the vast businesses that we have, where we have seen a destocking is really in our contact lens business. And you'll recall in the first quarter, we mentioned that on the back of some historical supply chain challenges, the distributor inventory was reduced here in the U.S., and we've now seen that bleed into the second quarter as mentioned earlier. And so that is the only area of significant stocking that has had a short-term impact on our business. As I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is that as we look through the full second quarter, we saw sequential improvement across that portfolio. Remember that we actually serve the needs of 40 million patients. We have, by far and away, a market leadership position here in the U.S. and globally with contact lenses. And so we see this as a blip and by no means a longer impact on our ability to continue to be leaders in contact lens. Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Chris. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much for taking the question. I'd like to wrap up with the orthopedics question. Hips and knees are growing faster than the historic rates, could you sort of unpack that a little bit and give us an idea of how much of that is patient volume, price, new products or maybe something else? And have a great day.\nTim Schmid: You too, Joanne, thank you. We are so proud of, , frankly the resurgence of orthopedics, and I couldn't be more grateful for the incredible effort across the world to really return as to high solid growth across the two platforms that you referenced. Specifically within hips, and I mentioned this in the first quarter, for the first time ever, we were able to declare market leadership position in hips here in the U.S. And to be direct in answering your question, it is all innovation based. It's not only continuing to drive our best-in-class implants, but it's also how we've surrounded those with enabling like our VELYS Hip Navigation and Kenzie. That 6% growth you saw in the second quarter is really indicative our innovation working for patients. On knees, another shout out to the team, almost 10% growth. We haven't seen that historically and once again driven by innovation. In a short roughly 2.5-year period, we have launched our VELYS system for knees into more than 20 markets. We have more than 70,000 procedures, and that is driver of our performance. And what gives us confidence is that we're continuing to build indications. You may know in the second quarter, we received 510(k) approval for our VELYS Uniknee. And we also are looking to build out that portfolio. And in short order, you will see news about our commitment to really bringing robotics to other parts of the orthopedic portfolio, especially in spine. And so once again, it's all innovation driven, and we expect it to continue. Thank you.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Joanne, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm proud of the progress we made through the first-half of the year. And I'm also energized as we look towards the remainder of 2024 and heading to 2025. As the only company dedicated to both medical technology and pharmaceuticals, we are uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of health care innovation. We are entering the second-half of the year from a position of strength, advancing our diverse portfolio and pipeline to continue bringing innovation into the patients we serve. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tim Schmid",
            "content": "Larry, thank you for the question. Let me be very clear, we remain absolutely committed to delivering solid growth in the full-year for 2024. And Larry, when you actually look at \u201824 Q2, it was a tougher quarter for us. And we knew this, given the fact that at this time last year around the second quarter, we saw the opening up of the China market, which as you know is an important market for us and that was expected. That was actually by the way, last year our fastest-growing quarter. Now in all transparency, as you heard initially in the comments earlier, there have been two businesses that have or two areas of our business that have performed below expectations. Number one is Vision and secondly, our performance in China, which right now is a very volatile market. Now in Vision, we initially announced in the first quarter some challenges with distributor stocking dynamics here in the U.S., some competitive pressures, as well as some macroeconomic challenges in Japan. What gives me confidence in the turnaround of that business is that we actually saw sequential improvement through the second quarter. Some of those stocking dynamic dynamics I mentioned bled into April, but month-on-month, we saw strong rebound of that business, in fact, to the end of the quarter back to historical levels. And so as we look to the back half of the year, while it's been a slower start there, we're very confident that we're going to be able to bring that business back to historical norms, driven primarily by innovation. Our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX portfolio and that global launch as well as the addition of our premium IOLs with TECNIS PureSee in Asia-Pac and EMEA as well as Odyssey here in the U.S., and so we believe we've got that under control. When I look to the back half onto answer your question more directly, the reason we are confident is firstly, not only the return to more normalized growth within Vision, but in surgery, by the way, that -- all that business also was impacted by a slower start, especially in China. We see that starting to normalize. And also remember in our surgery business, the results were impacted by the divestiture of a Acclarent last year. And so normalized growth -- our adjusted operational growth was actually closer to flat. We see that continuing to grow at low-single-digit through the back half of the year. We're proud of the solid results in ortho and see that continuing to be driven by strong results within hip 6%, in knees, almost 10%, driven by tremendous innovation, especially in VELYS. And then more broadly, I'll end with our real confidence in the growth of our cardiovascular portfolio. And remember, Larry, that we've got an EP business that's $5 billion today, grew 21% last year, 19% for the first-half of the year. In fact, in the second quarter, in the face of competition, here in the U.S. we grew that business 16%. And so we're very confident in our ability to grow that leadership position. And then finally, the addition of Abiomed still continuing to grow ahead of our deal expectations, 15.4%. I think that's going to be bolstered by the landmark results, the first time in 25 years, where we have the DanGer Shock study showing survivability benefits of Impella, which will continue to open new markets for that portfolio. And then finally, I'll end with how delighted we are to inch very, very short order, welcome Shockwave to Johnson & Johnson. We closed that transaction in record timing and are really excited by the fact that we will shortly announce that they will be the 13th business with sales in excess of $1 billion annually. And so for all those reasons, Larry, while a tougher second year -- second quarter primarily due to comps, we remain very confident in a solid 2024. Of course, Rick and thank you for the question. And Rick, I'd start with firstly, recognizing that we believe that PFA is really good for electrophysiology and really good for patients. It is a tailwind for the entire market. And as I mentioned earlier, that's a $5 billion market for us today, growing 19% year-to-date. And let me be clear, we clearly see some competition, especially here in the U.S., especially between now and the time that we bring our PFA technology to market, we're confident. While we don't control the timing, we expect to have that by the end of the year or early next year. As you know, we already have and are commercializing our PFA technology in EMEA and in Japan, and we are very fortunate to actually benefit from a very global EP business. What gives us confidence in the future, Larry, is that we believe that while PFA has a role to play in the portfolio, so does RF. From everything we're hearing from EPs around the world, what they like about PFA is the relative safety of the technology, but they also like about RF, which by the way, we have 20-years of leadership in safety and clinical efficacy, is the durability of that product. In fact, even today, Rick, here in the U.S., for every five procedures where PFA is used, RF is used in conjunction. And so we believe that leisure position that we built over the last 20-years will continue, both in RF and then obviously, we're excited by the launch of our PFA technology. You'll know that at the HRS conference in May, we announced the results of our admIRE study, which showed the 86% relative effectiveness -- primary effectiveness of our PFA technology. And we are going to continue to employ the same strategy we did in RF, which is building out a broad portfolio of PFA offerings, both in dual energy, focal, large focal and single shot. Did you know that today, the number one used catheter on the market is our SPF catheter within RF. And we are -- and you'll know that in the second -- first quarter of this year, we announced a application for a CE mark for our dual energy catheter. This will be one catheter used, both for RF and PFA technology. And so we've got a lot of reasons to believe. And I think to touch on your point on CARTO, one of the benefit of our portfolios, not just our energy source and catheters, it really is the installed base of 5,500 CARTO systems around the world. We just version 8 of that software. It is best-in-class in the market. And that's also complemented by highly trained clinical specialists in every cath lab around the world who are supporting EPs each and every day. And so once again, PFA is a good thing for the marketplace, it's a tailwind and we expect to continue to benefit on that. Thank you. Sure. And Danielle, we are fortunate to have a global business with more than 50% of our revenue already out of the U.S. And I think that gives us the flexibility to really manage a number of challenges that occur on a quarterly and yearly basis across the world. To Joaquin's point, we've been in China for 37-years. One of the reasons why we've been successful is our ongoing commitment in navigating multiple headwinds and opportunities.

            "content": "Yes, John Reed here. Thanks for that question. Well, we're really excited about the data in Sjogren's with nipocalimab. It's the data we delivered shows really sustained disease control, which is so important by our dosing regimen as compared to some of the intermittent dosing regimens used by others. And the consistent efficacy we've seen across all primary, secondary endpoints, et cetera, is really compelling as a guess that we may be on the first advanced therapy for Sjogren's that disease has ever seen. As you know, that's a very prevalent disorder affecting its estimated 4 million people around the world, perhaps 1 million in the United States, 90% of the people impacted are women right in the prime of life. So, we're really excited about the possibility of bringing forward the first advanced therapy for that disorder. Since you mentioned, DARZALEX. John Reed here, I thought maybe I would just remind you that actually, in this quarter, we delivered four additional positive Phase III studies with DARZALEX across a number of indications, including transplant ineligible frontline, including in the maintenance setting, after transplant, including smoldering condition that is as large as the entirety of diagnostically defying myeloma and in amyloidosis. So the momentum continues with DARZALEX."

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. With a strong second quarter, I'm excited about the rest of 2024. Our Innovative Medicine business is on track for a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth. Our success is driven by a portfolio of innovative best and first-in-class medicines, many of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Across the board, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, we are reinventing treatment paradigms and transforming lives. As Joe mentioned, we have made significant progress across our pipeline. In particular, I would like to highlight two major milestones on the horizon that will help drive sustained growth through 2025 and beyond. First, the approval and launch of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib for first-line treatment of EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And second, the approval and launch of TREMFYA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD, which follows the recent presentation of data that demonstrated superiority versus STELARA. This represents a meaningful opportunity for TREMFYA as approximately 75% of STELARA sales today come from IBD. We also have regulatory and data milestones for many of the assets that we expect to generate more than $5 billion in peak year sales. As the pipeline and portfolio progress, so too does our confidence in our near and long-term growth trajectory. We are confident in our ability to grow through the upcoming STELARA biosimilar entry and see accelerating momentum through the back half of the decade. In MedTech, year-to-date adjusted operational sales growth of 5.2% reflects continued progress with the portfolio as we move into higher growth markets. As you heard from Joe, we expect MedTech growth to accelerate in the second-half of the year. Growth will accelerate through continued expansion of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS Max 1-Day Contact Lenses, TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and VARIPULSE in Europe and Japan. Our confidence in the business outlook remains unchanged. With meaningful outcomes from the danger shock trial in Abiomed and the second quarter close of the shockwave acquisition, we look forward to continue the expansion into high-growth MedTech markets. As you know, Johnson & Johnson is laser-focused on advancing the next wave of medical innovation. We are building on a strong foundation to unlock accelerated growth with a healthy balance sheet and industry-leading investments in the best science and innovation. This enables us to move into the second-half of 2024 from a position of strength. With that, let's open the line for questions. Thank you, Danielle, it's Joaquin. So we were one of the first companies that started to operate in China, and we've been in China for decades. So we have a history of having constructive engagements with China, and we are looking forward for that to continue. Now we recognize the situation and we have robust business continuity planning practices in place, and we are able to mitigate any potential exposure. But we continue to see China as an important growth driver, both for our Innovative Medicine business and also for our MedTech business. Specifically, you had some questions that Tim can address on MedTech and how we see our MedTech business in China moving forward. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm proud of the progress we made through the first-half of the year. And I'm also energized as we look towards the remainder of 2024 and heading to 2025. As the only company dedicated to both medical technology and pharmaceuticals, we are uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of health care innovation. We are entering the second-half of the year from a position of strength, advancing our diverse portfolio and pipeline to continue bringing innovation into the patients we serve. Thank you."

            "name": "Jennifer Taubert",
            "content": "Hi, Chris, it's Jennifer and thanks so much for the question. Real quick before I get into that one, I just wanted to give a quick shout-out to all my internal Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a terrific quarter. Our first $14 billion-plus quarter that we hit in over 10 products with double-digit growth. So, really, really a tremendous quarter and looking-forward to a great half of the year as well. So, we are very excited about RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib and the data that we're seeing and really believe that it's going to have a significant place in frontline non-small cell lung cancer. As we've discussed before, there is a significant unmet need in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with about a quarter of patients never even making it to second-line therapy. So, a lot of patients that are there with high unmet medical need. When we take a look at the data that we've been able to generate in terms of PFS and when you add to that, the new data that we brought forward on our subcu dosing, we think together, we're going to have a really winning combination for patients in that frontline setting. So, high unmet need, really spectacular results that we're seeing and the subcu dosing we think is going to be a great combination. Thanks so much for the question. I'll answer the second part first. We do have very good confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO is treated separately than DARZALEX IV. And so yes, we continue forward with that perspective on that. In terms of IRA and kind of what's been going on, if we take a look at Part D redesign, while we're not externally quantifying the impact at this time, what we can say is that we do anticipate a net unfavorable impact in 2025. However, as outlined at our enterprise business review last November, we do anticipate, as a business, growing 3% plus next year and then 5% to 7% out through 2030. And these numbers are actually already included in that guidance that we provided. Same thing as it pertains to the government price setting process, we are still in that. We have received the final numbers from the government, we're not disclosing that at this time. That will be disclosed in the September time frame. And while we are not in alignment with IRA and the price setting process, those numbers have been included in the guidance that we provided last year at EBR, that still looks very good to us today. It's very consistent today. And we had 21% growth. $2.9 billion in sales and 21% growth. So yes, DARZALEX is our single largest asset now for the corporation. Thanks for the question on that. We're still in the process of working with all payers for the planned formularies and everything for 2025 and 2026. I think what's really most important is to go back to the guidance we provided at the EBR last year in November. And as we take a look at the corporation, we have factored in and anticipated what we think will happen. And as an organization, we feel very confident in the guidance of 3% plus growth in 2025, and really, importantly, that accelerating growth out through the end of the decade, the 5% to 7% growth."

            "name": "Joe Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Overall, Johnson & Johnson delivered solid top and bottom-line, as well as free cash flow growth in the quarter. Our Innovative Medicine business made great progress in the second quarter. We have strong momentum with key end-market products and continue to advance our pipeline with significant clinical and regulatory milestones being attained. Our MedTech business delivered growth that fell below our expectations of growing in the upper range of our markets, which as you recall correlates to a weighted-average market growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2022 through 2027. We came into the year thinking 2024 would be in the upper end of that range. With acceleration planned in the second-half, given some of the first-half dynamics Jessica outlined, we now expect growth closer to 6% for 2024. To me, this reflects the power and breadth of our company, where we can more than offset quarterly volatility in one part with overperformance from another part of our business. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to provide some qualitative business highlights from the quarter. Starting with innovative Medicine, in oncology, we continue to make meaningful progress across our disease areas of focus. Of note, we received FDA approval for CARVYKTI in earlier lines of therapy and reported positive top-line overall survival results from the CARTITUDE-4 study. We also submitted a filing with the FDA for our subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT. We presented updated results for TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we met primary endpoints for two DARZALEX studies, Cepheus and Aquila, where results will be presented at an upcoming major medical meeting. Turning to immunology, we achieved key milestones for TREMFYA in inflammatory bowel disease, including the presentation and filing of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as the filing of our subcutaneous formulation, which would make TREMFYA the only IL-23 inhibitor with a fully subcutaneous regimen. We also expanded our immunology portfolio with the acquisitions of Proteologix and NM26. These bispecific antibodies will further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our ability to address significant unmet need in atopic dermatitis. Finally, spanning immunology and neuroscience, we presented positive results for nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease and myasthenia gravis. But it doesn't stop with the second quarter. We are excited for what awaits in the second half of this year with the anticipated approval and launch of both RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline EGFR positive lung cancer and TREMFYA in IBD. We also expect data from JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ 4804, our co-antibody therapeutic in IBD and nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. As we continue to bring new innovations to market and execute against clinical and regulatory milestones, Innovative Medicine is well-positioned to achieve sustainable growth in both the near and long-term. Turning to MedTech, we continue to advance our pipeline, launch new commercial products and integrate strategic acquisitions that broaden and further differentiate our portfolio. In cardiovascular, we are enhancing our portfolio and shifting into higher growth markets through strategic acquisitions such as Shockwave Medical. In May, we announced the launch of our CARTO 3 Version 8 electroanatomical mapping system. This is the latest version of our 3D heart mapping system, which has machine learning capabilities that increase efficiency, reproducibility, and accuracy in maps electrophysiologists use to treat atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. In pulsed field ablation, we initiated the commercial launch of the VARIPULSE platform in the EU and Japan receiving early positive physician feedback in the external evaluation period. We also delivered results from the pivotal phase of the admIRE trial, where the VARIPULSE platform demonstrated 85% peak primary effectiveness with minimal adverse events, short PFA application times and low fluoroscopy exposure. In orthopedics, we received 510(k) FDA clearance for the clinical application of the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. This is designed for both medial and lateral procedures enabling surgeons to guide precise implant placement without a CT scan. In surgery, we launched the ECHELON 3000 in the U.S., which combines 3D stapling and gripping surface technology to enable greater staple line security. This has been shown to deliver 47% fewer leaks, reduce surgical risks and improve surgical outcomes. In surgical vision, we launched TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and head into a full market launch in the second-half of 2024. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology and cardiovascular pipelines as we prepare for the anticipated U.S. approval of VARIPULSE, as well as the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. Within robotic surgery, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for OTTAVA in the second-half of the year. Before turning to cash flow and guidance, I wanted to provide an update on the talc litigation. As announced on May 1, the company has committed to pay ovarian claimants a present value of approximately $6.5 billion or $8 billion nominally over 25-years, resulting 99.75% of all pending talc lawsuits against the company and its affiliates in the United States. We are currently in a voting period for the plan, where for the first time, claimants are able to vote for themselves for or against the plan. The last day of voting is scheduled for July 26. It will then take a few weeks for the vote administrator to vet and tally the votes. Once that process concludes, we plan to make a public announcement on the next steps regarding a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. Our confidence that we will reach the requisite 75% vote is bolstered by the continued support of council representing the vast majority of claimants with whom the plan was developed, as well as the announcement of support by additional prominent plaintiff law firms recently, including Ailstock, Keller Postman, and Miller. Additionally, in furtherance of our goal of achieving a comprehensive solution, we finalized the previously announced agreements reached with all states that advanced talc claims in the Imerys and Cyprus entities, owners of the mines that supplied talc to the company. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress with mesothelioma claimants with 95% of claimants now settled. Turning to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $41 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $7.5 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in the prior year period, which included cash flow from the Consumer Health business. During the quarter, we exited our retained stake in Kenvue, bringing the separation to a close. The net proceeds from the secondary offering were $3.6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We maintain a strong balance sheet, which continues to enable us to strategically invest in and grow our business, while returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. In the second quarter, we invested more than $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales in research and development. In terms of acquisitions and licensing, during the first half of 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $17 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities. This includes Shockwave, Proteologix and the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction announced last week, as well as more than 20 other smaller complementary business development transactions. While we will always explore strategic deals of any size that can create value, we foresee modest tuck-in deals as the preferred route over the near-term. Now turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Given the moving parts associated with the acquisitions this quarter, I'll start where I usually end with earnings per share. Before the impact of recent acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again being increased. As this schedule reflects, we are expecting a $0.05 per share increase in our operational performance. This would result in year-over-year EPS growth of 8.2% at the midpoint. To account for the completion of Shockwave, Proteologix, and the NM26 bispecific antibody transactions, and as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.68 per share. Combined, all of this yields an updated adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of $10 to $10.10 per share. In addition to assist with your future models, these transactions are expected to have a smaller impact of $0.33 to adjusted operational EPS in 2025. Now to address all elements of P&L guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full-year by $500 million to reflect the completion of the Shockwave acquisition. We now expect growth in the range of 6.1% to 6.6% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $89.4 billion or 6.4% at the midpoint. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 5.5% to 6.0% compared to 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. We are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.08, consistent with last quarter. However, there have been notable strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, specifically the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. As a result, we estimate an incremental negative foreign currency impact of $500 million, resulting in a full-year impact of $1.2 billion. As such, combined with the Shockwave acquisition, we expect reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2%, compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% growth. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Based solely on the dilution from the transactions, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by 120 basis points, more than offsetting the previously communicated 50 basis point improvement. We projected net interest income between $300 million and $400 million, lower than previous guidance driven by interest expense associated with financing of our recent acquisitions. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, an increase versus previous guidance driven by year-to-date performance. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full-year, much higher than 2023, largely due to the impact of OECD Pillar 2, as well as the non-deductible nature of the recently announced NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. We continue to expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe beginning the last week of July. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. While we had COVID-19 vaccine sales in the second quarter, we do not anticipate any future sales. Finally, it is worth noting that distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in the fourth quarter. In preparation for this transfer, we expect limited third-quarter sales in Europe. Turning to MedTech, as previously stated, we expect growth to accelerate back in line with our long-term expectations in the second-half of the year. This will be driven by recovery in contact lenses, evidenced by sequential monthly improvement within Q2. Further expansion into high-growth segments, including the integration of Shockwave and continued growth of new products and commercial execution across the portfolio. As you think about our adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect it to be higher in the first-half of the year, compared to the second-half. Again, this is due to the IP R&D charge for the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction in Q3 as well as the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe later this month. Lastly, as a reminder on share count, we only expect a partial benefit in the third quarter resulting from the share count reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer in August of 2023 with the fourth quarter being neutral. As we move forward, we remain focused on advancing our differentiated portfolio and achieving key clinical and regulatory milestones across Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained growth and long-term value for patients, customers, and shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin for concluding remarks before taking your questions. Sure, Josh. And I think my answer to your sort of volume question will be very brief and consistent with what we've shared before. For the most part, across the portfolio, we've seen volumes normalize. We did mention that we expected to see some of the -- some tailwinds from the backlog within Orthopedics in the first-half of the year. And we've seen that, but we expect that to normalize in the back half. We remain consistent in our belief in the 5% to 7% growth for our end markets and that we will perform well within that. As it relates to pricing, inflation has not been a friend to our industry, and we have put a lot of effort into really ensuring that we can secure preferential pricing across the world. I do think we benefit from the global nature of our business. While there are pockets cost containment efforts that we're managing, like VBP in China, we see tremendous opportunity to really secure a premium pricing, especially where we have differentiated innovation. And especially now that we're entering or are entering is like cardiovascular of significant unmet need, there is tremendous opportunities for us to ensure that we secure premium pricing for truly differentiated innovations, especially in areas like electrophysiology, in heart recovery with Abiomed, and more recently with Shockwave. Thank you. Dave, I'd also remind you too that over the last six years, and certainly a compliment to John, Jennifer and the team, that innovation really underscores the success that we've had with quarter in, quarter out performance in our Innovative Medicines business. Discounts and rebates six years ago, as compared to list price was only about 25% of that list price. Today, that number -- and this is not just the J&J number, but an industry number, gravitates towards 60%. So what we want to make sure that happens is this great innovation gets to patients and makes a difference in their lives and get them -- they have access through the discounting that we already provide. Thank you. It's a good question and the only area across the vast businesses that we have, where we have seen a destocking is really in our contact lens business. And you'll recall in the first quarter, we mentioned that on the back of some historical supply chain challenges, the distributor inventory was reduced here in the U.S., and we've now seen that bleed into the second quarter as mentioned earlier. And so that is the only area of significant stocking that has had a short-term impact on our business. As I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is that as we look through the full second quarter, we saw sequential improvement across that portfolio. Remember that we actually serve the needs of 40 million patients. We have, by far and away, a market leadership position here in the U.S. and globally with contact lenses. And so we see this as a blip and by no means a longer impact on our ability to continue to be leaders in contact lens. Thank you."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\nJessica Moore: Hello everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the first quarter business results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder you can find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording, and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda I will start by reviewing the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato our Chairman and CEO as well as Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our first quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the first quarter of 2024. Sales increased 3.9% with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide and 7.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.20 versus basic loss per share of $0.19 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.71, representing increases of 3.8% and 12.4%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2023. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.6 billion increased 2.5%, with growth of 8.4% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.3%, both worldwide and outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continued to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21%, primarily driven by share gains of six points across all lines of therapy and ten points in the front line setting. As of this quarter, we are now disclosing TECVAYLI sales, which were previously reported in other oncology. Sales achieved $133 million in the quarter, compared to $63 million in the first quarter of last year, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $157 million, compared to $72 million in the first quarter of last year, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. While sequential growth was roughly flat due to phasing, we continued to anticipate quarter-over-quarter growth with acceleration in the back half of the year. Other oncology growth was driven by continuing strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Also in oncology, ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 28.4%, primarily driven by share gains. Growth of 22.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth for both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. As a reminder, favorable patient mix was a driver in Q2 2023 through Q1 2024. Therefore, while we still anticipate growth, we expect to lap this dynamic beginning in Q2 2024. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 27.6%, driven by market growth and share gains. STELARA growth of 1.1% was driven by market growth and share gains in IBD, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in the U.S. and as expected, share loss in PSO and PSA. We anticipate continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry. In neuroscience SPRAVATO growth of 72% continues to be driven by share gains and additional market launches. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, which we anticipate continuing throughout the year, as well as a decrease in IMBRUVICA due to competitive pressures, partially offset by stocking dynamics in the U.S. Finally, it is worth noting distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide Med1ech sales of $7.8 billion increased 6.3%, with growth in the U.S. of 6.6% and 6.1% outside of the U.S. In the quarter, worldwide MedTech growth was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to fewer selling days, disproportionately impacting orthopedics. In cardiovascular previously referred to as Interventional Solutions, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.9%, with strong growth in all regions. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution, and a onetime inventory build in Asia-Pacific, impacting worldwide growth by approximately 370 basis points. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15%, driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Orthopedics growth of 4.8% includes a onetime revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the U.S. positively impacting worldwide growth by approximately 300 basis points. As a reminder, orthopedics was over indexed by the impact of reduced selling days in the quarter. Strong performance in hips and knees was driven by procedure recovery, growth of new products, and commercial execution. While trauma and spine were negatively impacted by competitive pressures and core trauma was further impacted by weather related softness in the U.S. Growth of 1.9% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our bio surgery and wound closure portfolios, partially offset by competitive pressures in China volume based procurement and energy and endo cutters. Contact lenses declined 2.3%, driven by U.S. stocking dynamics, partially offset by strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-day family of products. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3 2023. Surgical Vision grew 1.1%, driven by CNIS EYHANCE, a monofocal intraocular lens partially offset by China's VBP. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin leveraged by 160 basis points, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 supply network related exit cost. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 110 basis points, driven primarily by timing of marketing investment in the Innovative Medicine business. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels investing $3.5 billion, or 16.6% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.9 billion, or 21.4% of sales in Innovative Medicine, with the increase in investment being driven by continued pipeline progression. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.6 billion, or 8.3% of sales, a slight decrease driven by phasing. Interest income was $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $14 million of expense in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in income was driven by a lower average debt balance and higher interest rates earned on cash balances. Other income and expense was income of $322 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to an expense of $6.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This change was primarily due to the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.9% versus 61.8% in the same period last year, which was primarily driven by the tax benefit on the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2024 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales increased from 36.1% to 36.8%, primarily driven by an increase in non-allocated interest income with both Innovative Medicine and MedTech margins remaining relatively flat year-over-year. When comparing against the fourth quarter and full year 2023, Innovative Medicine and MedTech adjusted income before tax margins have improved. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\nJoseph J. Wolk: Thank you, Jessica. Hello, everyone. As you just heard, we are off to a solid financial start in 2024, complemented by sustained momentum within our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines, marked by significant regulatory and clinical milestones. Before we delve into segment highlights from the quarter, I want to touch upon some important announcements that we made that will further enhance our competitive positioning. Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing cardiovascular disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest growth innovation oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company. During the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer. Now I'll move to segment highlights from the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our growth in Innovative Medicine continues to be driven by momentum from key brands and the adoption of new products. During the quarter, we hit several regulatory and clinical targets that are key to delivering longer-term growth. Starting with oncology, in multiple myeloma, we received FDA approval and a positive CHMP opinion for CARVYKTI for patients who have received at least one prior therapy, making it the only BCMA targeting treatment available for patients in the second-line setting. We also received biweekly dosing approval from the FDA for TECVAYLI, the only approved BCMA targeting bispecific antibody that provides patients with dosing flexibility. And finally, we submitted an application to the EMA for regulatory approval for DARZALEX-based quadruplet therapy and were granted U.S. priority review by the FDA. In addition, we made significant steps forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. The approval was based on data from the Phase III PAPILLON Study. We also received priority review from the FDA and submitted a filing to the EMA for RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The priority review and filing to the EMA are supported by data from the landmark Phase 3 Mariposa Study. Turning to our immunology portfolio, we submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA seeking approval for TREMFYA in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We are looking forward to presenting data from the Phase 3 QUASAR Study evaluating TREMFYA in patients with ulcerative colitis at Digestive Disease Week in May. We also significantly advanced our pipeline with important data readouts including positive top-line results from the Frontier 2 study demonstrating JNJ2113 as the first and only investigational targeted oral peptide that maintains skin clearance in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through one year. Nipocalimab also delivered positive topline results in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in adults with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, respectively. We also received FDA breakthrough designation in the treatment of HDFN, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and fast-track designation for FNAIT, a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder in infants. Looking ahead, we expect upcoming data readouts for ERLEADA in localized prostate cancer as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 results for our combination therapy JNJ4804 in psoriatic arthritis as well as pivotal data from TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer which will be presented at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May. Lastly, we're excited to present our Phase 3 TREMFYA Crohn's disease data as well as our Sub-Q data for RYBREVANT at upcoming medical meetings. In MedTech, notable highlights in the first quarter includes significant advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio. In Pulsed Field Ablation, we received CE Mark approval for VARIPULSE based on the 12-month INSPIRE Study which demonstrated 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence and zero primary adverse events. We filed for U.S. approval of VARIPULSE based on the ADMIRE Study which showed all pilot phase patients achieved acute success and 80% remaining free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after one year. We also submitted a CE Mark filing for our Dual Energy Smart Touch SF Catheter, which will provide physicians the optionality for RF and PFA energy sources in one catheter. We began enrollment of patients in a pivotal trial evaluating Laminar's left atrial appendage elimination device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the late-breaking DanGer Shock Study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed routine use of Abiomed\u2019s Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with STEMI cardiogenic shock reduced 180-day mortality by 12.7%. In vision we launched TECNIS PURE C, a next-generation presbyopia-correcting lens for cataract patients in EMEA. We also presented new data for our presbyope correcting IOL, TECNIS Odyssey at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in April. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology pipeline with the full U.S. market release of the QDOT microcatheter, the U.S. commercial launch of Abiomed Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist as well as the submission of Impella ECP. Within our robotic surgery pipeline, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Otava [ph] in the second half of 2024. Turning to financials, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended the first quarter with $26.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $33.6 billion of debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the first quarter of approximately $3 billion. This was above the first quarter of 2023, which included the consumer health business cash flow. Also in the first quarter of 2024, we incurred elevated payment levels made in furtherance of achieving a responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position and ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities. Innovation continues to be a main priority for the company, as demonstrated by our industry-leading R&D spend. During the first quarter, we invested more than $3.5 billion in research and development or 16.6% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders through our dividend. We appreciate the value our investors place on the dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 4.2% increase marking our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. As we stated previously, we are disciplined in our approach to inorganic growth and prioritize acquisitions that strategically fit and present meaningful long-term growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the pending transaction in which we are adding a profitable commercialized portfolio of Shockwave Technologies in high-growth markets as well as a robust pipeline. I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes the recently announced acquisition of Shockwave. As previously communicated, we assume the closing of the transaction will take place by midyear 2024 at which time we will update our guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately $0.10 per share driven by financing costs. Based on the results delivered in the first quarter, we are tightening our ranges and increasing the midpoint for our full year operational sales and adjusted operational EPS guidance. As such, we expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% or $88.7 billion to $89.1 billion increasing the midpoint by $300 million or 0.3%. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.09. As of last week, the Euro spot rate was 1.08, a modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar also experienced by a handful of other currencies. As a result, we now estimate a negative full year foreign currency impact of $700 million resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% at the midpoint, consistent with last quarter's guidance. We are maintaining other elements of our guidance provided on January's earnings call, with the exception of two items, we are increasing interest income to a range of $550 million to $650 million. We are also tightening the range of our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance from $10.60 to $10.75, increasing the midpoint by $0.03 to $10.68, reflecting year-on-year growth of 7.7%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year estimates a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.03 per share. As a result, the reported adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at $10.65, reflecting 7.4% growth versus 2023. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect that the same qualitative considerations provided during January's earnings call to remain intact. We anticipate Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half given the anticipated entry of STELARA Biosimilars in Europe midyear. For MedTech we expect operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We look forward to advancing our pipelines in both segments to deliver innovative treatments, solving some of the most complex health challenges. This wouldn't be possible without our employees around the world, so it's only appropriate before turning to your questions that we recognize and thank our colleagues for their continued hard work, commitment, and dedication to patients. I'm pleased to be joined by Joaquin, Jennifer, John and Tim for the Q&A and kindly ask Kevin to provide instructions to initiate that portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part on myeloma. First, on CARVYKTI, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the phasing comments that impacted sales in the quarter? And then secondly, on TECVAYLI, how should we think about growth for this product, it looks like it's been somewhat flattish over the last couple of quarters, but just wondering if TALVEY had an impact there, so as we think about those franchises back half of this year, maybe you could provide high-level commentary? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Terence, for your question. And before we go into the specifics of your question on CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our multiple myeloma franchise, let me share with all of you some reflections on this quarter. We are entering 2024 in a position of strength, and I'm particularly encouraged on the performance of our strategic platforms, the ones that are going to drive growth in the second half of the decade. In Innovative Medicines, DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA all grew over 20% and specifically on TREMFYA, now we have more sales in our psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic indications than we do with STELARA and we have high expectations for the brand with ulcerative colitis data to be presented at the Digestive Disease Week just a few weeks from now and also data on Crohn's Disease to be presented also this year. We continue to see increased demand from our new product launches, SPRAVATO, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, CARVYKTI with CARVYKTI just a few weeks ago receiving FDA approval to move into the second line setting. Now let me move into MedTech. We have demonstrated a strong performance across cardiovascular, in electrophysiology and Abiomed and we have made significant progress with our PSA portfolio. We also have delivered several important capital allocation milestones in Q1, investing heavily in R&D, raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year closing the Ambrx acquisition and announcing the planned acquisition of Shockwave Medical. As you have heard from Joe in his prepared remarks, we continue to make progress on achieving a responsible final and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financial but also the numerous pipeline advancements. It is a solid start of the year that puts us in a position of strength for 2024. And it also the sustained progress gives us -- give me great confidence in achieving our long-term growth goals of operational sales compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030. Overall, it gives me great confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson, now to Jennifer on your question, Terence, on CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY.\nJennifer L. Taubert: Thanks, Joaquin. Hello Terence and good morning everybody. Just also a quick shout out and a big thanks to our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world, delivering 8.3% adjusted operational growth, definitely above-market growth for the quarter, with strength being really across our core launch, our core and launch brands, nine brands achieving double-digit growth, 10 actually, if you include TALVEY in that mix. A strong pipeline progress that Joaquin noted and also the announcement and closing of our acquisition of Ambrx really to add another key pipeline asset for us as well as key technology that can help us in ADCs. So really strong quarter all the way around. With respect to your question specifically in multiple myeloma and then CARVYKTI and TALVEY, multiple myeloma continues to be a true stronghold for us, and we had significant performance and growth across the board in those assets during the quarter. I can start off real quickly with DARZALEX with 21% growth, predominantly with that growth coming in the frontline setting and also it was noted that [indiscernible] data has been filed, which will offer us an additional expansion in frontline. For CARVYKTI, we had over 100% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, very, very strong demand. We did have both the ADCOM in the United States, which results in an unanimous recommendation for approval and then the subsequent to the end of the quarter, approval of CARVYKTI for that line two plus which we think bodes very well. I know there's always questions on how are we doing and where we're expanding our capacity, given the strength of the data and the additional data that's coming through in indications. I'm real happy to say we have doubled our manufacturing capacity since the beginning of 2023 for cell processing. We are continuing to work on our Gant [ph] facility to have that as a secondary source of supply. We brought on some contract manufacturers, and we have completely transformed and expanded antivirus production so that, that's not a rate-limiting step for us. So I know we were a flat -- roughly flat quarter-to-quarter from 4Q to 1Q as noted, that really just was some phasing and timing of orders and when they were actually delivered and built for nothing that -- anything to really see there. We do anticipate continued growth for this asset, particularly second half versus the first half as we continue to add more slots and expand our capacity. And based on the data and everything that we're seeing, we've continued to have a lot of optimism for how CARVYKTI is performing. Likewise, as it relates to TECVAYLI, the TECVAYLI launch is going very well around the world. Consistently, we're seeing very strong uptake and rapid adoption, whether we're in the U.S., Germany, Austria, France, the major markets that have launched to date and really as the first and we believe best-in-class off-the-shelf BCMA bispecific, we really believe that, that therapy is offering deep and durable responses. And so a lot of optimism for continuing to drive the launch there. The product is performing well in the later line settings and is also performing very well from a competitive standpoint. And last but not least is actually TALVEY, which is our 10th product with double-digit growth, although that falls in the all other oncology categories. So we're not fully breaking that out yet. But very, very strong uptake as the first in GPRC5D off-the-shelf by bispecific as well. So I think what this really means is we have got fabulous opportunities across lines of therapy with what we believe are truly best-in-class agents and many of these agents have potential as well to be combined as we work towards curing multiple myeloma. So a significant business for us, and I'm very positive on our outlook for the rest of the year and going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. A question for Tim. Your MedTech business grew 6.5% on an adjusted operational basis in Q1, but there were a number of onetime items. What was the net impact from those onetime items in your view and what are you seeing around the world from a procedure standpoint and what are your expectations for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nTimothy Schmid: Well, thank you for the question, Larry. And let me maybe just reflect a little on the journey that we've been on. As you know, we surpassed $30 billion last year with adjusted operational growth of 7.8%. And I think it's important to note that when we compare ourselves against the majority of the competitors within our competitive composite, we are double their size. So that is performance that we are particularly proud of. We've now followed that up with another solid quarter of 6.3% growth in the first quarter. Now Larry, to your point, there has been some noise in that. We are particularly proud of the tremendous double-digit growth within our Electrophysiology business. And to put that in context, this is a business that is nearing on $5 billion, growing north of 20%. And I think that really calls out the leadership position, which we're continuing to build on and couldn't be more excited about the progress we're making in PFA, which we believe also will continue to drive that performance. There has been some noise specifically in relation to our Vision business. But please rest assured, we are extremely confident in the underlying health of our Vision portfolio. This is a business that grew 6.6% last year, and we expect it to grow in high single-digit performance this year. There has been some stocking issues related to distributor inventory, which was the predominant driver of the performance you see this year. But once again, very confident that we'll see that return to strong single-digit performance for the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of one-timers both in terms of selling days, as we mentioned earlier, about 80 bps of selling days and then a revenue recognition change within our orthopedics business, which impacted that business by about 300 basis points. But all in all, a strong quarter Larry, and we remain very committed to strong high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year for 2024. Thank you.\nJoseph J. Wolk: Larry, I just want to maybe add on to Tim's good comments there. The one timers, there was tailwinds and headwinds in that number. So the 6.3% that you're seeing is 6.5% is pretty much a true number when you consider both sides of the equation.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.\nChristopher Schott: Great, thanks so much for the question. I think BD type question here. I guess following the Shockwave acquisition, what's the appetite, I guess, for further away, maybe talk about like larger tuck-in type transactions either in your MedTech or Pharma business. It just seems like the portfolio and the pipeline at J&J has evolved pretty nicely over the past few years and I'm interested if you think the business is now at a point where we can think about maybe smaller earlier-stage assets as the primary focus for BD or do you still have a greater sense of urgency either in MedTech or pharma to add some of these kind of bolt-on type transactions going forward? Thanks so much.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Chris, and this is Joaquin. I'm glad that you recognize the strategic consistency of our M&A trajectory, and that's good. Our M&A strategy looks for the long term. So it's not going to change. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to be disciplined and M&A, it's going to be -- remain a critical component of that. And it's important for me to underline that with the strength of our cash flow and our balance sheet, we have significant flexibility to consider multiple types of transactions, as you mentioned. And what we have done so far is a demonstration of that with Abiomed, Laminar, Ambrx, and now the planned acquisition of Shockwave, all of them are good examples of our study consistency and the principles that we have outlined to you. So that is not going to change. Our M&A strategy is not going to change. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities agnostic to the sector and size and what we are looking for, it's a number of components. One, does this technology improve the current standard of care. That's critical for us. To what extent we believe there is a patient impact, which is positive. Number two, does it -- is it consistent with the capabilities and knowledge that we have in-house. We see a correlation between that and the success in the acquisitions. Number three, does it enable us to enter into higher growth markets, so areas that are growing in which we can continue to develop that market. And finally, and very important for us, does it continue to deliver a compelling financial result for our shareholders. So that's our M&A strategy, and it's been a cornerstone of our ability to create value. I am glad that you recognize the consistency that we have deployed, and it's not going to change looking into the future. When we think about M&A, we think in decades, we don't think opportunistically.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Can you maybe circle back to Vision Care, please and can we unpack the different parts that are positive and negatives on the IO and the contact lens business? Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato: Of course, Joanne and thank you for bringing this up because it does look odd and certainly isn't consistent with our expectations or the performance that we expect going forward from that business. As I mentioned earlier, this is a business that grew 6.6% in 2023 and actually consistently grows in high single-digit. We absolutely believe in the underlying health of our Vision business and that it remains strong and continues to perform above market. As I mentioned earlier, the Q1 performance was predominantly driven by a contraction of U.S. distributor inventory in contact lens. As we have mentioned in the past, we had some variability in terms of our supply, which resulted in changes within distributor inventory. We've now started to see that as our supply for contact lenses has stabilized, we've started to see a normalization of the inventory that our distributors are carrying on hand. And so that is the big driver in the results that you see today. As you know, in contact lens, this is an annuity business where it's all about how you gain your fair share of new users, while at the same time, protecting the base. We are incredibly pleased with the ongoing performance of our premium ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family and we are seeing unprecedented share gains in multifocal. I will also say that if we look at sequential share gains across the contact lens business, we are seeing sequential gains, which should bode well for continued performance for the remainder of the year. Specifically to IOLs, as you know, we are not currently a market leader, but we are expecting to deliver the fourth consecutive year of global share gains driven primarily by tremendous performances of our IOL business in Asia Pac and in EMEA. We're also excited, as you heard from Jess earlier by the limited market release of our TECNIS PURE C and Odyssey next-gen multifocals and we'll see a full release occurred through the remainder of the year. So once again, very confident that you will see tremendous improvement in the performance of that business, and we expect high single-digit growth for Vision for 2024. Thank you Joanne.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Shibutani: Great, thank you very much. Good morning. If I could ask about the Pulmonary Hypertension business. This quarter, quite strong. You mentioned, in particular, share gains and favorable patient mix, if you could help us understand that a little bit better? And then on the forward, the pulmonary arterial hypertension segment is anticipated to see some disruption with the introduction of the recently approved product from [indiscernible]. Can you comment on what you're thinking the portfolio will perform and how that market will respond to this anticipated shift? Thank you.\nJennifer L. Taubert: Hi Chris, it's Jennifer. So yes, we're really pleased with our Pulmonary Hypertension results for the first quarter with both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, delivering strong growth that was both volume and share gains in the market as well as some favorable patient mix and really rounding out a year of favorable patient mix. That last piece we don't see continuing to go forward to the same degree. But the products are performing very well for patients with PAH. Importantly, in the quarter, we got approval for OPSYNVI, which is the first combination tablet of PDE5 and an ERA. This is in line with guidelines. It's really once a patient is diagnosed really the right first choice for them is to start them on combination therapy. And so we think that this is an important introduction. And as we take a look at our portfolio and even despite other new competitors that are coming in, we do believe with OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, they have got very strong usage and both with the launch of OPSYNVI as well as what we have, that these will continue to be really productive assets and a good therapeutic area for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Tim, if I could just follow up on MedTech and specifically orthopedics and appreciate the onetime revenue recognition, not sure you can provide any color on exactly what changed there. But also, you talked about consistent MedTech growth going forward. I mean taking -- backing that out, you get to sort of 3% U.S. orthopedic sales growth. Is that the right way to think about that specific segment going forward or am I missing some onetime tailwinds, maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for ortho given what you guys put up this quarter? Thanks so much.\nTimothy Schmid: Thank you, Danielle. Firstly, we are operating in a very robust market. As we communicated in the fourth quarter of last year, we still see some remnants of procedural backlog that are benefiting primarily our Orthopedics business, and we expect that to continue at least to the first half of 2024. As you mentioned, our overall performance in Orthopedics of 4.8% was impacted by a onetime change in revenue recognition timing. And this is only related to our U.S. business, but it did impact that business by about 300 basis points. Now keep in mind, we also had the impact of the fewer selling days, which disproportionately impacted our ortho business by 80 bps. We are proud of the ongoing progress we're making, specifically in areas where we needed to compete better and specifically in hips and knees, we saw high single-digit growth in the first quarter and specifically in knees driven by the tremendous performance of our VELYS platform. We're now within two years in 18 markets, 50,000 procedures and are seeing that as a constant tailwind as we now expand the provision of VELYS into EMEA and Asia Pac through the remainder of the year. And so I think you can expect continued improvement in our Orthopedics business for the remainder of the year as we continue to build our portfolio and drive further expansion across the globe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nCharles Young: This is Charlie Yang for Geoff. I have two questions, please. I know there's recent news regarding the INVEGA SUSTENNA Calpal [ph] litigation. Can you just tell us about kind of what we should kind of think about in terms of the potential kind of impact or in terms of the timing of the next steps? And then second, can you just talk about the TAR [ph] bladder cancer data expectation in terms of what kind of benchmark we should expect in terms of the 1-year CR rate? Thank you.\nJennifer L. Taubert: Perfect. I'll take the INVEGA SUSTENNA question, and I'll pass it over to my colleague, John to take the next one. So if we think about our LAI portfolio, our long-acting injectable just as a reminder for everybody, we really are leading therapies in this space with our INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA products. And we're really excited about the latest data that we have, particularly for HAFYERA, which a recent study shows that at two years, 96% patients on HAFYERA are relapse free, which is really, really striking. So as we get to the legal question, we really don't speculate on the impact of ongoing litigation. But that being said, we remain really confident about the strength of our INVEGA SUSTENNA patents, and we're going to continue to defend the intellectual property that's associated with these patents. If we're clear to go a little bit deeper, the Federal Circuit\u2019s April 1st decision did not invalidate our patent. It just remanded the case back to the New Jersey District Court, the one that had ruled in our favor originally. Likewise, there was another ruling and another case on this patent against a different company that also did go in our favor. So it's going back to the original judge that ruled in favor of the patents, and we'll have to see what comes. We don't speculate on that, but we remain really confident on the strength of our patents.\nJohn C. Reed: Yes. Thanks for your interest in the platform that we have, the drug device combo for early bladder cancer. Clearly, a great unmet need and as much as there are more than 600,000 people every year who are diagnosed with early bladder cancer and the vast majority of those patients go on to have their bladders removed, which clearly has a very detrimental effect on quality of life. With our drug device system which I think, again, is a great example of how MedTech and pharma can come together in a synergistic way, but we delivered really, I think, exciting early data. Those were presented at the ESMO conference last September and showed, for example, with the TAR200 product that has gemcitabine, an impressive complete response rate of over 75% and nice durability with 21 out of 23 patients, we showed at that meeting is still ongoing and no patients having had to progress to a radical cystectomy. So I think at the AUA, because those data are not yet disclosed, I can't provide the details, but I think you can expect to see more of the same now with longer follow-up and with more patients. We've expanded those cohorts and do believe that we're on track to deliver pivotal data in that first indication, which is in the BCG nonresponsive patients recollect that in early bladder non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Standard care is this attenuated micro bacteria BCG. Unfortunately, fewer than half patients receive -- achieve a complete response. And the therapy is -- has tolerability problems to say the least where patients feel like they have a chronic urinary tract infection. The discontinuation rate with TAR200 has been very low. So we're very delighted with the excellent tolerability profile as well as these impressive deep efficacy, deep and durable efficacy. So yes, so please watch that AUA presentation. I think we remain on track for a filing early next year based on these pivotal data, and we look forward to sharing those results at that congress.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So a follow-up maybe on some of the device trends, in particular, cardio and EP very strong in the quarter. Wondering if you could provide some color kind of geographically as to how some of the product launches have either driven overseas or competitive environment in the U.S. has affected U.S. performance so far? And then just one quick one on Ortho, if I could.\nTimothy Schmid: Sure, Matt. Firstly, let me start on cardio. As Joaquin mentioned, we've made a lot of progress in building out our portfolio. And until recently, we only participated in one high-growth category within cardiovascular and that being electrophysiology, which I will touch on performance in a second. We are and have had a 20-year lead in electrophysiology and now have built on that position in cardiovascular with the acquisition of Abiomed. We're now over a year into integrating that business and couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made. We continue to perform ahead of the deal model. And once again, this quarter did so with growth in excess of 15%. That gives us now two leadership positions within cardiovascular care. Once we close the acquisition of Shockwave, that will be our third very thoughtful and deliberate move to only participate in high-growth, high-margin cardiovascular areas where there is significant unmet need and tremendous opportunity for us to grow. And so we're very excited by the fact that we will be one of the only strategics with only high growth, high-margin businesses in the largest category within MedTech, $60 billion market, growing roughly 8%, incremental $5 billion of growth coming out of that category each and every year. So very excited by those moves. Specifically, to your questions on EP, we've seen growth across the board in excess of 20%, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. And I think it really talks to the trust that our customers have in our technology today. RF and our portfolio of RF products are the most trusted and tested products with 20 years of experience. And by the way, we're not going to miss PFA, the progress we've made on ensuring that we can build our presence in that category with the approval in the EU as well as in Japan. We've also submitted for FDA approval. And while we don't control the timing, we expect that approval to come through by the end of this year or early next year. And so very confident in our ability to build on our leadership position in EP. Was there a specific question to Ortho?\nMatthew Miksic: Just a comment on Ortho generally was sort of low to mid-single digits, but in hips and knees, sounded like 9%-ish, we added back the selling day and you're at double digits is just kind of really off the chart growth, I think, in that category. And I'm just wondering should we see like some sustainability of that rate or ramping down of that rate, how can you help us think about the rest of the year, in particular, in hips and knees?\nJoseph J. Wolk: Well, Matt, I think it's a testament to the progress of our team but then also in building out our portfolio. We had some gaps in the past and now filling those gaps both in hips and then even more notably in knees with the launch of our VELYS robot is really what is creating the tailwind that we're enjoying today, and we do expect that to continue. Now this was a strong quarter. Can we see that sort of growth every single quarter, not absolutely sure, but we do expect high single-digit growth out of both of those categories going forward. I will also say that the work we've done in the orthopedics areas hasn't been just about growth. It's also about improving our margin profile. And you know that in the second quarter of 2023, we announced a major restructuring, which is focused on really simplifying our portfolio and focusing our business on where we could drive the greatest impact for patients and for shareholders. That effort is resulting in a 20% reduction in our implants. And just to put that in context, we have 100,000 implants today within our orthopedics business. And so a real testament to the effort of group to not only drive top line performance but also evolve the portfolio to improve margins. Thank you again Matt.\nJessica Moore: Thanks, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nVamil Divan: Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe if no one is after me I will just lead into it. One, I just was curious on SPRAVATO and sort of where like very strong growth again this quarter. If you can just provide a little more context there on where the growth is coming from, what sort of practices, what that the patients are given that product to be hopefully get a sense of that trend? And then just the other question we get a lot from investors is on the drug price negotiations with Medicare on the 10 drugs that are selected for this year's program through IRA. I know you probably won\u2019t get too much into the specifics, but I'm curious if you can just share some high-level thoughts on how the progress of those discussions are going and is it sort of in line with what you expected, is there anything sort of very different from what you expected as the process plays out? Thank you.\nJennifer L. Taubert: Well, thanks for the question, and thanks for asking about SPRAVATO. We continue to be really pleased with the uptake of SPRAVATO as we continue to launch that product globally. You saw that there's over 70% growth in the quarter as it continues to perform well for patients with treatment-resistant depression. And so we've got a bold outlook for SPRAVATO as we continue to launch it into more markets and as we are able to even further penetrate the existing markets that we're in into a bit more of the community setting there. In terms -- so good -- really, really good outlook. We're also just to put in a plug for neuroscience. We talk a lot about our oncology business and our immunology business. Neuroscience is also a key area for us, so SPRAVATO is a key platform. We've also got aticaprant and seltorexant coming, and we had mentioned the long-acting therapies with the INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise earlier. So back on IRA, we've been really clear that we do think that these -- the IRA\u2019s drug setting provisions are damaging to the health care innovative system. It just -- it is not something that is going to help reinforce the tremendous investments that we're making in R&D to develop the next types of treatments and cures. That being said, we do focus on patient access and are trying to make sure that our products are available to the patients who need them. And so we're working appropriately with the government and in line with the process to start going back and forth around what the ultimate price will be. So there has been a round or two of going back and forth. And so we're still in the middle of that process. I can't really provide any more details on that. What I will say is that the products that we have that are going through the process, they are not our growth drivers for the future. Those are -- they are our products that are more at end of life. And so they're not the ones that are going to be really key for us both in the coming years as well as out through the end of the decade. And what I'd love to also reinforce is that we do remain confident that we've got a clear path to achieving our $57 billion commitment that we made back in December at our Enterprise Business Review as well as from 2025 to 2030, delivering above market growth with the 5% to 7% compounded annual growth rate and with growth in every year that being 2025 as well as all of the years beyond that. So irrespective of the IRA, when I take a look at our growth drivers and how our pipeline is coming in, we feel really confident about the state of our business.\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Vamil, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and Johnson & Johnson's solid first quarter performance reflects our sharpened focus and the progress in our portfolio and pipeline. Our impact across the full spectrum of health care is unique in our industry and the commercial, clinical, and capital allocation milestones achieved in Q1 reinforce our position as an innovation powerhouse. One of the most significant milestones this quarter was the announcement of our planned acquisition of Shockwave that will further strengthen our leadership position in cardiovascular. We continue to make strong progress towards the goals that we set out at our December Enterprise Business Review, and I'm looking forward to all that we will achieve through the remainder of 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph J. Wolk",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. Hello, everyone. As you just heard, we are off to a solid financial start in 2024, complemented by sustained momentum within our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines, marked by significant regulatory and clinical milestones. Before we delve into segment highlights from the quarter, I want to touch upon some important announcements that we made that will further enhance our competitive positioning. Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing cardiovascular disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest growth innovation oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company. During the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer. Now I'll move to segment highlights from the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our growth in Innovative Medicine continues to be driven by momentum from key brands and the adoption of new products. During the quarter, we hit several regulatory and clinical targets that are key to delivering longer-term growth. Starting with oncology, in multiple myeloma, we received FDA approval and a positive CHMP opinion for CARVYKTI for patients who have received at least one prior therapy, making it the only BCMA targeting treatment available for patients in the second-line setting. We also received biweekly dosing approval from the FDA for TECVAYLI, the only approved BCMA targeting bispecific antibody that provides patients with dosing flexibility. And finally, we submitted an application to the EMA for regulatory approval for DARZALEX-based quadruplet therapy and were granted U.S. priority review by the FDA. In addition, we made significant steps forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. The approval was based on data from the Phase III PAPILLON Study. We also received priority review from the FDA and submitted a filing to the EMA for RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The priority review and filing to the EMA are supported by data from the landmark Phase 3 Mariposa Study. Turning to our immunology portfolio, we submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA seeking approval for TREMFYA in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We are looking forward to presenting data from the Phase 3 QUASAR Study evaluating TREMFYA in patients with ulcerative colitis at Digestive Disease Week in May. We also significantly advanced our pipeline with important data readouts including positive top-line results from the Frontier 2 study demonstrating JNJ2113 as the first and only investigational targeted oral peptide that maintains skin clearance in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through one year. Nipocalimab also delivered positive topline results in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in adults with Sjo\u0308gren's Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, respectively. We also received FDA breakthrough designation in the treatment of HDFN, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and fast-track designation for FNAIT, a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder in infants. Looking ahead, we expect upcoming data readouts for ERLEADA in localized prostate cancer as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 results for our combination therapy JNJ4804 in psoriatic arthritis as well as pivotal data from TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer which will be presented at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May. Lastly, we're excited to present our Phase 3 TREMFYA Crohn's disease data as well as our Sub-Q data for RYBREVANT at upcoming medical meetings. In MedTech, notable highlights in the first quarter includes significant advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio. In Pulsed Field Ablation, we received CE Mark approval for VARIPULSE based on the 12-month INSPIRE Study which demonstrated 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence and zero primary adverse events. We filed for U.S. approval of VARIPULSE based on the ADMIRE Study which showed all pilot phase patients achieved acute success and 80% remaining free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after one year. We also submitted a CE Mark filing for our Dual Energy Smart Touch SF Catheter, which will provide physicians the optionality for RF and PFA energy sources in one catheter. We began enrollment of patients in a pivotal trial evaluating Laminar's left atrial appendage elimination device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the late-breaking DanGer Shock Study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed routine use of Abiomed's Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with STEMI cardiogenic shock reduced 180-day mortality by 12.7%. In vision we launched TECNIS PURE C, a next-generation presbyopia-correcting lens for cataract patients in EMEA. We also presented new data for our presbyope correcting IOL, TECNIS Odyssey at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in April. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology pipeline with the full U.S. market release of the QDOT microcatheter, the U.S. commercial launch of Abiomed Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist as well as the submission of Impella ECP. Within our robotic surgery pipeline, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Otava [ph] in the second half of 2024. Turning to financials, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended the first quarter with $26.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $33.6 billion of debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the first quarter of approximately $3 billion. This was above the first quarter of 2023, which included the consumer health business cash flow. Also in the first quarter of 2024, we incurred elevated payment levels made in furtherance of achieving a responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position and ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities. Innovation continues to be a main priority for the company, as demonstrated by our industry-leading R&D spend. During the first quarter, we invested more than $3.5 billion in research and development or 16.6% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders through our dividend. We appreciate the value our investors place on the dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 4.2% increase marking our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. As we stated previously, we are disciplined in our approach to inorganic growth and prioritize acquisitions that strategically fit and present meaningful long-term growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the pending transaction in which we are adding a profitable commercialized portfolio of Shockwave Technologies in high-growth markets as well as a robust pipeline. I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes the recently announced acquisition of Shockwave. As previously communicated, we assume the closing of the transaction will take place by midyear 2024 at which time we will update our guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately $0.10 per share driven by financing costs. Based on the results delivered in the first quarter, we are tightening our ranges and increasing the midpoint for our full year operational sales and adjusted operational EPS guidance. As such, we expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% or $88.7 billion to $89.1 billion increasing the midpoint by $300 million or 0.3%. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.09. As of last week, the Euro spot rate was 1.08, a modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar also experienced by a handful of other currencies. As a result, we now estimate a negative full year foreign currency impact of $700 million resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% at the midpoint, consistent with last quarter's guidance. We are maintaining other elements of our guidance provided on January's earnings call, with the exception of two items, we are increasing interest income to a range of $550 million to $650 million. We are also tightening the range of our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance from $10.60 to $10.75, increasing the midpoint by $0.03 to $10.68, reflecting year-on-year growth of 7.7%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year estimates a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.03 per share. As a result, the reported adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at $10.65, reflecting 7.4% growth versus 2023. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect that the same qualitative considerations provided during January's earnings call to remain intact. We anticipate Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half given the anticipated entry of STELARA Biosimilars in Europe midyear. For MedTech we expect operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We look forward to advancing our pipelines in both segments to deliver innovative treatments, solving some of the most complex health challenges. This wouldn't be possible without our employees around the world, so it's only appropriate before turning to your questions that we recognize and thank our colleagues for their continued hard work, commitment, and dedication to patients. I'm pleased to be joined by Joaquin, Jennifer, John and Tim for the Q&A and kindly ask Kevin to provide instructions to initiate that portion of the call. Larry, I just want to maybe add on to Tim's good comments there. The one timers, there was tailwinds and headwinds in that number. So the 6.3% that you're seeing is 6.5% is pretty much a true number when you consider both sides of the equation. Well, Matt, I think it's a testament to the progress of our team but then also in building out our portfolio. We had some gaps in the past and now filling those gaps both in hips and then even more notably in knees with the launch of our VELYS robot is really what is creating the tailwind that we're enjoying today, and we do expect that to continue. Now this was a strong quarter. Can we see that sort of growth every single quarter, not absolutely sure, but we do expect high single-digit growth out of both of those categories going forward. I will also say that the work we've done in the orthopedics areas hasn't been just about growth. It's also about improving our margin profile. And you know that in the second quarter of 2023, we announced a major restructuring, which is focused on really simplifying our portfolio and focusing our business on where we could drive the greatest impact for patients and for shareholders. That effort is resulting in a 20% reduction in our implants. And just to put that in context, we have 100,000 implants today within our orthopedics business. And so a real testament to the effort of group to not only drive top line performance but also evolve the portfolio to improve margins. Thank you again Matt."

            "name": "John C. Reed",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for your interest in the platform that we have, the drug device combo for early bladder cancer. Clearly, a great unmet need and as much as there are more than 600,000 people every year who are diagnosed with early bladder cancer and the vast majority of those patients go on to have their bladders removed, which clearly has a very detrimental effect on quality of life. With our drug device system which I think, again, is a great example of how MedTech and pharma can come together in a synergistic way, but we delivered really, I think, exciting early data. Those were presented at the ESMO conference last September and showed, for example, with the TAR200 product that has gemcitabine, an impressive complete response rate of over 75% and nice durability with 21 out of 23 patients, we showed at that meeting is still ongoing and no patients having had to progress to a radical cystectomy. So I think at the AUA, because those data are not yet disclosed, I can't provide the details, but I think you can expect to see more of the same now with longer follow-up and with more patients. We've expanded those cohorts and do believe that we're on track to deliver pivotal data in that first indication, which is in the BCG nonresponsive patients recollect that in early bladder non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Standard care is this attenuated micro bacteria BCG. Unfortunately, fewer than half patients receive -- achieve a complete response. And the therapy is -- has tolerability problems to say the least where patients feel like they have a chronic urinary tract infection. The discontinuation rate with TAR200 has been very low. So we're very delighted with the excellent tolerability profile as well as these impressive deep efficacy, deep and durable efficacy. So yes, so please watch that AUA presentation. I think we remain on track for a filing early next year based on these pivotal data, and we look forward to sharing those results at that congress."

            "name": "Timothy Schmid",
            "content": "Well, thank you for the question, Larry. And let me maybe just reflect a little on the journey that we've been on. As you know, we surpassed $30 billion last year with adjusted operational growth of 7.8%. And I think it's important to note that when we compare ourselves against the majority of the competitors within our competitive composite, we are double their size. So that is performance that we are particularly proud of. We've now followed that up with another solid quarter of 6.3% growth in the first quarter. Now Larry, to your point, there has been some noise in that. We are particularly proud of the tremendous double-digit growth within our Electrophysiology business. And to put that in context, this is a business that is nearing on $5 billion, growing north of 20%. And I think that really calls out the leadership position, which we're continuing to build on and couldn't be more excited about the progress we're making in PFA, which we believe also will continue to drive that performance. There has been some noise specifically in relation to our Vision business. But please rest assured, we are extremely confident in the underlying health of our Vision portfolio. This is a business that grew 6.6% last year, and we expect it to grow in high single-digit performance this year. There has been some stocking issues related to distributor inventory, which was the predominant driver of the performance you see this year. But once again, very confident that we'll see that return to strong single-digit performance for the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of one-timers both in terms of selling days, as we mentioned earlier, about 80 bps of selling days and then a revenue recognition change within our orthopedics business, which impacted that business by about 300 basis points. But all in all, a strong quarter Larry, and we remain very committed to strong high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year for 2024. Thank you. Thank you, Danielle. Firstly, we are operating in a very robust market. As we communicated in the fourth quarter of last year, we still see some remnants of procedural backlog that are benefiting primarily our Orthopedics business, and we expect that to continue at least to the first half of 2024. As you mentioned, our overall performance in Orthopedics of 4.8% was impacted by a onetime change in revenue recognition timing. And this is only related to our U.S. business, but it did impact that business by about 300 basis points. Now keep in mind, we also had the impact of the fewer selling days, which disproportionately impacted our ortho business by 80 bps. We are proud of the ongoing progress we're making, specifically in areas where we needed to compete better and specifically in hips and knees, we saw high single-digit growth in the first quarter and specifically in knees driven by the tremendous performance of our VELYS platform. We're now within two years in 18 markets, 50,000 procedures and are seeing that as a constant tailwind as we now expand the provision of VELYS into EMEA and Asia Pac through the remainder of the year. And so I think you can expect continued improvement in our Orthopedics business for the remainder of the year as we continue to build our portfolio and drive further expansion across the globe. Thank you. Sure, Matt. Firstly, let me start on cardio. As Joaquin mentioned, we've made a lot of progress in building out our portfolio. And until recently, we only participated in one high-growth category within cardiovascular and that being electrophysiology, which I will touch on performance in a second. We are and have had a 20-year lead in electrophysiology and now have built on that position in cardiovascular with the acquisition of Abiomed. We're now over a year into integrating that business and couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made. We continue to perform ahead of the deal model. And once again, this quarter did so with growth in excess of 15%. That gives us now two leadership positions within cardiovascular care. Once we close the acquisition of Shockwave, that will be our third very thoughtful and deliberate move to only participate in high-growth, high-margin cardiovascular areas where there is significant unmet need and tremendous opportunity for us to grow. And so we're very excited by the fact that we will be one of the only strategics with only high growth, high-margin businesses in the largest category within MedTech, $60 billion market, growing roughly 8%, incremental $5 billion of growth coming out of that category each and every year. So very excited by those moves. Specifically, to your questions on EP, we've seen growth across the board in excess of 20%, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. And I think it really talks to the trust that our customers have in our technology today. RF and our portfolio of RF products are the most trusted and tested products with 20 years of experience. And by the way, we're not going to miss PFA, the progress we've made on ensuring that we can build our presence in that category with the approval in the EU as well as in Japan. We've also submitted for FDA approval. And while we don't control the timing, we expect that approval to come through by the end of this year or early next year. And so very confident in our ability to build on our leadership position in EP. Was there a specific question to Ortho?"

            "name": "Joaquin Duato",
            "content": "Thank you, Terence, for your question. And before we go into the specifics of your question on CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our multiple myeloma franchise, let me share with all of you some reflections on this quarter. We are entering 2024 in a position of strength, and I'm particularly encouraged on the performance of our strategic platforms, the ones that are going to drive growth in the second half of the decade. In Innovative Medicines, DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA all grew over 20% and specifically on TREMFYA, now we have more sales in our psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic indications than we do with STELARA and we have high expectations for the brand with ulcerative colitis data to be presented at the Digestive Disease Week just a few weeks from now and also data on Crohn's Disease to be presented also this year. We continue to see increased demand from our new product launches, SPRAVATO, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, CARVYKTI with CARVYKTI just a few weeks ago receiving FDA approval to move into the second line setting. Now let me move into MedTech. We have demonstrated a strong performance across cardiovascular, in electrophysiology and Abiomed and we have made significant progress with our PSA portfolio. We also have delivered several important capital allocation milestones in Q1, investing heavily in R&D, raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year closing the Ambrx acquisition and announcing the planned acquisition of Shockwave Medical. As you have heard from Joe in his prepared remarks, we continue to make progress on achieving a responsible final and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financial but also the numerous pipeline advancements. It is a solid start of the year that puts us in a position of strength for 2024. And it also the sustained progress gives us -- give me great confidence in achieving our long-term growth goals of operational sales compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030. Overall, it gives me great confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson, now to Jennifer on your question, Terence, on CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Thank you, Chris, and this is Joaquin. I'm glad that you recognize the strategic consistency of our M&A trajectory, and that's good. Our M&A strategy looks for the long term. So it's not going to change. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to be disciplined and M&A, it's going to be -- remain a critical component of that. And it's important for me to underline that with the strength of our cash flow and our balance sheet, we have significant flexibility to consider multiple types of transactions, as you mentioned. And what we have done so far is a demonstration of that with Abiomed, Laminar, Ambrx, and now the planned acquisition of Shockwave, all of them are good examples of our study consistency and the principles that we have outlined to you. So that is not going to change. Our M&A strategy is not going to change. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities agnostic to the sector and size and what we are looking for, it's a number of components. One, does this technology improve the current standard of care. That's critical for us. To what extent we believe there is a patient impact, which is positive. Number two, does it -- is it consistent with the capabilities and knowledge that we have in-house. We see a correlation between that and the success in the acquisitions. Number three, does it enable us to enter into higher growth markets, so areas that are growing in which we can continue to develop that market. And finally, and very important for us, does it continue to deliver a compelling financial result for our shareholders. So that's our M&A strategy, and it's been a cornerstone of our ability to create value. I am glad that you recognize the consistency that we have deployed, and it's not going to change looking into the future. When we think about M&A, we think in decades, we don't think opportunistically. Of course, Joanne and thank you for bringing this up because it does look odd and certainly isn't consistent with our expectations or the performance that we expect going forward from that business. As I mentioned earlier, this is a business that grew 6.6% in 2023 and actually consistently grows in high single-digit. We absolutely believe in the underlying health of our Vision business and that it remains strong and continues to perform above market. As I mentioned earlier, the Q1 performance was predominantly driven by a contraction of U.S. distributor inventory in contact lens. As we have mentioned in the past, we had some variability in terms of our supply, which resulted in changes within distributor inventory. We've now started to see that as our supply for contact lenses has stabilized, we've started to see a normalization of the inventory that our distributors are carrying on hand. And so that is the big driver in the results that you see today. As you know, in contact lens, this is an annuity business where it's all about how you gain your fair share of new users, while at the same time, protecting the base. We are incredibly pleased with the ongoing performance of our premium ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family and we are seeing unprecedented share gains in multifocal. I will also say that if we look at sequential share gains across the contact lens business, we are seeing sequential gains, which should bode well for continued performance for the remainder of the year. Specifically to IOLs, as you know, we are not currently a market leader, but we are expecting to deliver the fourth consecutive year of global share gains driven primarily by tremendous performances of our IOL business in Asia Pac and in EMEA. We're also excited, as you heard from Jess earlier by the limited market release of our TECNIS PURE C and Odyssey next-gen multifocals and we'll see a full release occurred through the remainder of the year. So once again, very confident that you will see tremendous improvement in the performance of that business, and we expect high single-digit growth for Vision for 2024. Thank you Joanne. Thank you, Jess, and Johnson & Johnson's solid first quarter performance reflects our sharpened focus and the progress in our portfolio and pipeline. Our impact across the full spectrum of health care is unique in our industry and the commercial, clinical, and capital allocation milestones achieved in Q1 reinforce our position as an innovation powerhouse. One of the most significant milestones this quarter was the announcement of our planned acquisition of Shockwave that will further strengthen our leadership position in cardiovascular. We continue to make strong progress towards the goals that we set out at our December Enterprise Business Review, and I'm looking forward to all that we will achieve through the remainder of 2024."
