Thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 business performance and strategy update. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy as the pandemic continues to impact all facets of our daily lives and our loved ones. As we work with our pharma supply chain to support the development and distribution of a vaccine, we must not lose sight of the severity of the situation globally. Here at Jacobs, aligned with our core value of we do things right, we will continue to prioritize the health of our employees and our communities. During this pandemic, we have prudently adjusted our cost structure while continuing key strategic investments to position Jacobs to accelerate growth as the economy recovers. We have continued to take deliberate strategic actions to drive inclusivity and diversity of thought across Jacobs as well as making targeted investments to accelerate our digital capabilities. We strongly believe these investments position Jacobs to capture a compelling growth opportunity to emerge as a uniquely positioned strategic consultant and delivery partner across a diverse set of sectors where we have deep domain expertise.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business performed well, demonstrating CMS' resiliency and alignment to the diverse set of high-value sectors we serve, such as national security, space exploration, intelligence, nuclear life cycle solutions and the deployment of 5G infrastructure. Total CMS backlog is at $9.1 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis and does not include our previously awarded King's Bay intelligent asset management win, which we fully expect a clear protest in early April. Importantly, approximately half of our bookings during the fourth quarter were from new business.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Before I begin, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 included an extra week compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. While this impact was factored into our guidance, it represented approximately $100 million in a year-over-year net revenue tailwind for each of CMS and People & Places. Fourth quarter gross revenue, as a result, increased 4% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue up 2%. People & Places net revenue was up 8% year-over-year, and Critical Mission Solutions declined 3.6% on a pro forma basis. The CMS decline was mainly attributed to the early impact from transitioning off of two lower margin contracts, as I will explain later, in more detail. It is important to note CMS operating profit on a pro forma basis increased 14% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.5% down 135 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin was driven by a combination of factors primarily within People & Places, including overall revenue mix, the comparison versus a very strong year-ago quarter, the impact of some project closeout costs and the previously discussed flow-through effect of the reimbursable rate of a more efficient fixed cost structure in the LOB. The lower reimbursement rate for fixed cost is more than offset by the underlying lower level of G&A costs. This impact to reimbursable rates from our cost structure is also reflected, and overall, lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 100 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%. As it pertains to G&A, the fourth quarter continued to benefit from low travel and employee-related medical costs. GAAP operating profit was $22 million and included $211 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, of which the vast majority was associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $24 million of other charges consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $1 million of costs associated with the Worley transition services agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $258 million, up 2% from the prior year figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, a result of the lower People & Places margins discussed earlier. This was partially offset by improved critical emissions margins and flat year-over-year unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers of these costs on the line of business review slide. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $70 million and $0.53 per share and included $1.22 per share of after tax restructuring, transaction and other charges, as noted above, an amortization charge of acquired intangibles of $0.13, both of which were partially offset by a $0.34 net benefit, largely driven by the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.63, including a $0.24 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding these discrete great tax items in both the current and year ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was essentially flat year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $277 million and was up 1% year-over-year, reaching 9.8% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 for Q4, driven by solid bookings from both lines of business. As Bob noted, the over $400 million previously awarded Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management win remains in protest, and as a result, is excluded from our backlog figures. We expect to be notified of our resolution mid fiscal year 2021. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by strong new business dynamics within Critical Mission Solutions. We believe nearly all of the opportunities we are pursuing have strong bipartisan support as they are high-priority areas associated with national security. We believe that the People & Places Solutions business overall sales pipeline also supports strong long-term growth. We continue to see changes in the underlying composition and timing of opportunities driven by a more environmentally friendly U.S. administration as well as covered related impacts. Turning to Slide 10. Let me summarize our fiscal 2020 performance. For the full year, revenue increased 7% and net revenue increased 2.5% pro forma for the Wood Nuclear acquisition. GAAP operating profit was $536 million, and adjusted operating profit was $970 million, up 9% versus the year ago figures. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.05 billion and increased 7%, reaching 9.6% of net revenue. Our fiscal year 2020 book-to-bill was 1.07 times. And before leaving our consolidated annual results, I would like to make some summary comments regarding our first half and second half performance. Fiscal 2020 has been defined by a year of two very different halves. Prior to COVID, our first half performance was indicative of strong momentum, with pro forma growth net revenue growth of over 6% and double-digit pro forma operating profit growth, resulting in operating profit margins up 50 basis points year-over-year. As the pandemic took hold, our teams quickly adjusted plans for the second half of the year as we've recognized that physical distancing and economic disruption would impact our earlier revenue momentum. Revenue ended up being relatively flat in the second half versus both the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, indicating the resilience of our portfolio. Importantly, our teams were able to successfully manage to a lower cost structure than our original plan with costs reduced over $100 million during the second half versus our original plan. The agility of our teams to adjust rapidly was profound, and we are proud of them for having successfully mitigated the economic disruption to the Company and the impact to our clients. So regarding our LOB, let's turn to the Slide 11. Starting with CMS, as expected, pro forma revenue declined 3.6% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from the two large lower margin contracts we are transitioning off and the benefit of the extra week of revenue, growth would have also been down low single digits year-over-year, driven by the impacts associated with COVID-19. While revenue was down, CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with operating profit margin up 140 basis points year-over-year to 8.1%. Even factoring in the extra week in the fourth quarter, operating profit would have increased high single digits year-over-year. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities with some additional benefit from favorable project closeouts. From a full year perspective, pro forma revenue was down 1%, and operating profit on a pro forma basis increased 8%. Operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 7.5% from fiscal 2019 against -- again, consistent with our strategy consistent with our strategy to expand our CMS margins. Looking into fiscal 2021, we expect CMS reported net revenue to be up low single digits as we ramp new wins and benefit from newly acquired higher margin revenue. Given the strategy to capture higher value opportunities and the benefit from acquisitions, we expect reported operating profit growth to be up double digits. We do believe that the improvements will be more back half-oriented given the impact from the two lower margin contracts will be more than offset with the new higher-margin business later in the second half. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q4 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year but would have been relatively flat, excluding the benefit of the extra week during the fourth quarter. Operating profit was down 8% year-over-year. And as a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.2% for the quarter, down over 210 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by COVID-related headwinds in the quarter, some project closeout costs and the strong -- very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from project closeout benefits. From a full year perspective, PPS net revenue was up 6%, with operating profit up 4%, reaching an operating profit margin of 12.4%, slightly down versus a year ago due to pressure associated with COVID-19 in the second half. Looking forward, we expect People & Places revenue to be up low single digits for fiscal 2021, with relatively flat growth in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect operating profit margin as a percent of net revenue to increase modestly from fiscal 2020, given the higher-margin mix in our sales pipeline and lower costs from our focused -- Focus 2023 initiatives. These benefits will be largely offset in 2021 by additional costs as we transition from cost mitigation efforts executed during the second half of fiscal 2020 to a more sustainable cost structure in 2021 and beyond associated with driving profitable growth. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, flat from the year ago period. On an annual basis, non-allocated corporate costs were $143 million, up 9% year-over-year. Looking forward to 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher, driven mainly by inflation and medical costs, improved employee benefits and an increase in employee discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns. Now turning to Slide 12. I would like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integration. As Steve discussed, the pandemic has fundamentally changed nearly all facets of the economy, which has provided us the ability to challenge our current processes to reinvest how we deliver solutions to our customers in the future. During Q4, we formed a dedicated internal team with assistance from an external adviser to examine the future work and other transformational opportunities. We are embarking upon a strategic initiative, Focus 2023, that we believe will lead to enhanced employee experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth, high-margin opportunities and drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for improved longer-term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred a nearly $200 million charge related to our Focus 2023 initiative, of which there was only $1 million in cash outflow during the quarter. Of the charge, approximately 80% was related to noncash real estate lease impairments as we plan to decrease our fiscal footprint by over 30%. The remainder of the costs was related to strategically leaning out the organization. In 2021, we project that we will have more than another $30 million in one-time costs associated with our Focus 2023 initiative. Our initiative has already generated approximately $75 million in quick win cost savings in fiscal 2021. This is allowing the Company to offset the incremental cost noted earlier expected in fiscal 2021 as compared to our lower cost structure associated with our COVID mitigation efforts in fiscal year 2020. In addition, it's expected that the run rate of these quick wins will provide another $25 million in savings in 2022 as we realize the full annual run rate benefits into the next year. Beyond these quick one savings, we believe there are substantial additional benefits approaching another $100 million into 2022 and 2023, which we will believe support incremental investments that will accelerate our growth and drive towards a more digital, innovative company that provides unique value-added solutions to our clients. We will provide additional detail of our Focus 2023 initiative during our expected Investor Day in the first half of calendar year 2021 and provide an update on our FY '21 Q1 earnings call. Now turning to our acquisition of Wood's Nuclear business. We are on track to achieve our targeted $12 million in run rate cost savings and the business continues to perform in line with our original target despite top line headwinds from headwinds from physical distancing. And finally, the acquisition of The Buffalo Group was announced today. While terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the acquisition is expected to deliver $0.08 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. And the cost of the acquisition adjusted EBITDA when including the tax benefits from the acquisition. And finally, when including all initiatives, including Focus 2023 and all M&A efforts, we expect the total estimated amount of approximately $80 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows during fiscal 2021. Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 13. During the quarter, we generated $403 million in free cash flow as a result of very strong collections and lower headwinds from cash restructuring. Q4 cash flow included a positive $23 million of net one-time benefits primarily due to a pandemic related cash tax deferral, partly offset by headwinds from cash outflows associated with restructuring and other items. For fiscal year 2020, we generated $689 million in free cash flow above our original expectation. Our annual free cash flow included $10 million of net nonrecurring outflows. When excluding this $10 million net headwind for the full year, the Company delivered a 96% free cash flow conversion to our adjusted net income figure for the year, demonstrating the strong free cash flow capabilities of the business. Over the medium term, we continue to target 100% conversion of recurring cash flow from adjusted net earnings. As previously stated, we expect approximately $110 million cash outflows related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring and integration during fiscal 2021. We also expect a reversal of pandemic-related UK payroll tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2020 of at least $40 million. That results in an expected total headwind of $150 million of cash outflows in the fiscal year 2021, including these one-time items. DSO performance in Q4 was the major driver to our improved free cash flow improvement, down almost nine days, excuse me, from 3Q 2020 as many of the collection process improvement initiatives implemented gain traction. We are focused on maintaining this lower DSO level, which will be a major driver to our ability to deliver a 1x free cash flow conversion target long term. And now moving to the balance sheet. Given the strong free cash flow for the quarter and year, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $900 million and a gross debt of $1.7 billion, resulting in $800 million in net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.5 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regarding capital deployment, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million worth of our shares. For modeling purpose, we would expect an average share count of $131 million for the first quarter 2021 and fiscal year 2021, excluding additional material share buyback activity. Of course, as Steve noted in his opening comments, our plan is to proactively deploy our capital as we plan for the transition out of a COVID-19 environment. Regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the fiscal 2021 year, in line with our longer-term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased earlier this year and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year ago. Now, I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on Slide 14.\nSteve Demetriou: All right. Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.055 billion to $1.155 billion, which represents year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be a range of $5.20 to $6. It's important to note that our guidance does not include any benefit from material future share repurchase activity. We do expect to fully utilize our balance sheet capacity over time through share repurchases or acquisitions that provide returns in excess of back. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth to rebound to double-digit adjusted EBITDA as we benefit from our Focus 2023 initiative as well as potential infrastructure-related stimulus and economic recovery. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning, Jerry.\nKevin Berryman: Good morning,\nBob Pragada: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Can you expand on Focus 2023 initiative? I'm sure we'll hear more at the Analyst Day, but just touch on what are the additional pillars beyond the cost reductions that we're talking about here? And Kevin, maybe just a clarification, how much of the $200 million savings do you expect to reinvest in digital when we look at it on a run rate basis in 2023? What's going to be the net number we should keep in mind? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Jerry, just sort of at a high level, the two major pillars, really, and the first one is really growth. It's all about driving the next-generation technology growth. We've obviously learned a lot over this past 10 months, 11 months with what happened during the pandemic, and it's really given us tremendous opportunity to accelerate our solution set across a variety of sectors that Bob really covered in both LOBs. And the second pillar is delivering our work more efficiently, effectively. We have a huge opportunity with what we outlined with regard to the way we're going to have a much more dynamic operating model moving forward with flexible workspace, continued remote working. So, a significant opportunity to reduce cost, but that goes far beyond just the real estate and travel. It's really back office efficiency, procurement and a whole host of other things that should deliver significant cost savings. So, those are sort of the combinations that -- again together unleashes a growth trajectory for Jacobs moving forward. Kevin, on -- some more on the financial side.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Jerry, so if you think about the savings associated with the Focus 2023, I already quoted some of the numbers, but to note that couple of hundred million dollars, almost $200 million of one-time costs that's primarily associated with lease impairment cost non-cash charge. And if you think about what that translates into in terms of the reduction in the -- let's call it the real estate costs going forward, it's roughly $35 million, of which, the vast majority is associated with a reduction in lease costs. So, as you think about that, there is obviously much more savings on top of that, which totaled to the $75 million we talked about with a run rate of an additional $100 million. Those are related to the initiatives about leaning out the organization and the efficiencies gained with ultimately the investments in tools and capabilities and training associated with the Focus '23. It is really clear that we've learned a ton during these last nine months and we're taking full advantage of that and being proactive and leaning forward to, to help take these learnings and create something even better for ourselves and our clients, and our people going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks, good morning. I guess for Kevin, Steve mentioned making progress on the margin targets. Can you remind us what those are at this point? I think at the Investor Day, it's kind of high-8s for CMS, low-13s for PPS. I don't know -- I don't think that FY 2021 guidance implies you get there next year. So, can you just kind of remind us where the targets are? What the timeline is? And I don't know what the earnings power is from all of what you're talking about here this morning?\nKevin Berryman: Yes, look, I think as you -- before COVID, actually, the People & Places business was pretty much on target to deliver that, that kind of margin target in 2020 and then got disrupted little bit given the second-half of the year, Joe. But I think that at the end of the day, we're going to be right close to those kind of figures in 2020 -- 2021 fiscal year. On CMS, I think, we're going to be right there in terms of the margin targets that we had characterized back in 2016, kind of mid-8s, hopefully, maybe a little bit higher, but I think that that's what our expectations are for CMS. So, I think we're right there. You have noted in our comments that the CMS margins are going to be driven by a relatively lower revenue growth because we're working off some of these other longer-term contracts, but that could be replaced by a more robust margin profile business over the course of 2021, leading to a really strong margin profile consistent with what the original targets were for 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Just first question to follow-up on the question that was just asked. On the margins, you're talking about hitting the margin targets in 2021 that you laid out, I think, in 2019. But I guess, given the incremental $200 million plus in costs that we're taking, how do we think about the longer-term margin profile? Can we get better margins than what we laid out in 2019? Or do we need this to achieve that given COVID? And then my second question, any color that you can provide on the Buffalo acquisition in terms of how that business -- the organic sales growth or EBITDA or margin of that business? And I'm just trying to understand, excluding Buffalo, would you have grown your 2021 EBITDA year-over-year like you laid out earlier in the year? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, just Jamie to start with -- hand it back to Kevin for maybe some more financial back up is that, yes, we expect the Focus 2023 to give us incremental margin improvement as we get beyond 2021. It's one of the major opportunities and objectives of that initiative. And the Buffalo acquisition is accretive to CMS margins. So, it's going to enhance that on top of what I just said. And so I think the combination of those two, as well as the backlog profile we have and looking at the -- some of the multi-year aspects of that backlog and the higher margins in the current backlog as we move forward, gives us confidence for multi-year margin improvement. Kevin?\nKevin Berryman: I would echo the same thing, Steve, that you reemphasized the fact that the Focus 2023 really is while we're getting some cost efficiencies here that the intention is that we're going to be able to reinvest back into some of the digital capabilities that we know are there, which facilitate our ability to win solutions with our clients or deliver solutions to our clients that ultimately are associated with a higher margin profile. So, really is about growth, and it really is about a margin profile longer-term that we would expect to see upward trajectory versus kind of the 2021 figures.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, hey, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Buffalo Group. If there are any small business set asides or items like that, that might be part of the retain over time? And if you could just broadly characterize the M&A pipeline from here how it looks in terms of number of properties and potential sizes that you're looking at?\nBob Pragada: Adding to the first one, I missed the second part of the question. Could you repeat the second part?\nGautam Khanna: Yes, sure. So, if you could characterize the M&A pipeline as it stands post Buffalo. What else is out there? If there's -- if that's a big part of the 2021 plan, further M&A?\nBob Pragada: Okay, great. Yes, on the first one, the small business set asides we took a really strong look at that and these -- not just these recent awards, but then the trend that we see going forward with regards to the areas of the government that the Buffalo Group is involved with are full and open. So we don't really see that the small business set asides of the past affecting how we see the real synergies that the platform is going to bring to our overall business. So we're optimistic on that front, and then Steve, you want to add?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, on the overall M&A pipeline, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about essentially going back to our 2019 strategy Investor Day, and that is as we just did with The Buffalo Group, we'll continue to look at ways to strengthen our government services business and move up the value chain there. From an overall Company standpoint, we've talked about digital consulting, strategic consulting becoming a bigger end-to-end player, especially on the front end, geographic expansion is another area. So, just very consist of staying core to our strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Kevin, obviously you reported a strong free cash flow quarter, 96% adjusted free cash flow. Do you think Q4 was basically the inflection point toward generating strong free cash flow conversion going forward? And then why would conversion actually go down in FY '21, excluding one timers, which has gone off your range given all the work you've done with the improvement in collections and back office systems work you've done?\nKevin Berryman: So, thanks for that question. I would say a couple things. One that I hope you're right that we will perform better than those numbers, first comment. But I think, as we think about the balance of next year, the back half of 2020 did have some challenges relative to our revenue being less robust than what we would originally assumed. So, as you think about the working capital dynamics associated with that number in the back half of the year, at the end there is some tailwinds, because we don't have as much of a bills and the working capital numbers in 2020. As we transition to 2021, and if we get to the conversion numbers we're actually talking to, actually we're making further improvements in DSOs because you're now facing an investment back into working capital. So, at the end of the day, we think it's a continuation of that journey to get to that one-time conversion number, which I've always kind of targeted the year 2022 as to getting there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nChad Dillard: So, what's embedded in your upper and lower end of the guidance range, ascribing the tax benefit '21 and rest of that '20, which suggests earnings at the low end of the '21 guide, in terms of inclusive of the $9 benefits from Buffalo, the Wood Group cost savings, just want to help bridging earnings from this past year into 2021.\nKevin Berryman: Yes, Chad, let me take a crack at that and respond. Look, we recognize that our range here is relatively wide. But we also recognize that we continue to be in the midst of a pandemic. And while we feel really good of our ability to have done a great job in the second half of 2020 to mitigate some of the challenges associated with it, we still are in the midst of it. And so I think the low end of our range would be something that we hope never happens, but it would be a situation where the economics are challenged around the globe and that will have situation of that -- of that magnitude, which by the way still results in our ability to be flat versus year ago in a dire economic environment. That's how we would characterize the low end of our range. At the high end of the range, we're starting to be more optimistic as we come out of the dynamic associated with COVID and that we are developing the momentum that we actually think will happen into 2022 faster. So I think that's how we would characterize the range. I think we're being prudent by putting that range there and hopefully it gives you some constructive use as to see what the potential downside is under a pretty bad scenario and what the potential upside is under a good scenario.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks, good morning. Just wondering if you can give a little more color on the cadence on the revenue and EPS guidance for fiscal '21? It sounds like perhaps Q1 revenues might be down kind of low single digits, but it's hard to tell how back-end weighted EPS is and how relatively light versus consensus Q1 might be. And also just trying to get a sense of sort of the revenue trajectory here, if something is selected more positively or just sort of like a normalizing kind of from a COVID situation? Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: Yes, Steven, this is Kevin. I'll just reinforce what I said earlier, I think the first half is more flattish relative to our net revenue figures and back half is less flat, it starts to show some momentum. And so I think that that's how we would see the cadence. We're still in the midst of the pandemic, certainly we feel like we're going to be holding serve relative to our first six months. And given all the strong work that we're doing on everything else, we're going to see some actual margin improvements and profit improvements in the first half, but the revenue cadence is probably little bit more flattish in the first half developing additional momentum in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe this for Bob, when you're looking out for 2021 in the PPS segment -- PP&S segment, characterize the different funding flows or expectations from the private sector and public sector clients. And it seems like you got some international momentum on that business. So I'd like to hear little more details on that? And maybe for Steve, you mentioned a couple of times in the presentation about positive aspect from the Biden Administration, are your clients -- is there a pent-up demand for things to get going again once some of the uncertainty with the election and COVID passes with the vaccine success, which I know you guys were involved with on the production side, is that really going to be that the kick of the inflection to see the growth in second half of '21, and going into '22? Thanks.\nBob Pragada: Sure. Mike, let me just kind of take it one at a time. Private sector, you know it is really well long-term -- long-term relationships that we have with the private sector clients that we haven't. So if you look at what does that mean for Jacobs, predominantly in the manufacturing space as well as a bit on the environmental side with regards to other industrial clients, we're actually starting to see a bit of an uptick as those clients really look at not only the portfolio mix, but also how they reorganized their global supply chain as a result of the learnings from COVID. So a bit of -- it's -- and it kind of touches the profile of services that we offer. So we can help them with regards to conceptual planning and kind of looking at helping them solve those solutions with other innovations that we have on how they look at that. So on the private sector side, we're starting to see, we have visibility to where those will materialize into other downstream projects and we're in that phase right now. Public sector, steady business and that's a global comment and I'll come back to kind of a nuance between international and U.S., but we are seeing in the U.S. public sector is that the creativity that state and local government have already exhibited for the better part of the last three years to four years has continued, And with some of the extensions, whether it be continuing resolution extension within the government or it would be on the bond measures that have 31 of the 44 bond measures passed in this last election, they're utilizing those types of measures in order to continue on the projects, whether it be in transit or in water. Stimulus would be added to that, we monitor ourselves over what we could see. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the U.S. and the international side the stimulus money is already is -- we're starting to see some effect of that specifically in UK with the 10 point plan already starting to see some early planning work around that. And then in Australia, we're already starting to see some of the effects of those of those money flowing through. So overall we are well positioned for whichever -- whichever way the markets go.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, Michael part two of your question, I think it's a combination of pent-up demand and accelerating demand over the course of the next 12 months to 24 months. And what I mean by that is pent-up side obviously things like the fact that the life science, pharma industry has been totally focused on COVID-19, but there's a whole host of opportunities there that they need to get back at around oncology and biotech, etc., you think of the whole aging infrastructure dynamics in the U.S. and the UK and other areas that have to be addressed. And I think those two regions specifically the government is now set up to hopefully live up to strong stimulus and funding around infrastructure the next several years. But then you've got the whole accelerating demand that we talked about, which is really driving our Focus 2023 initiative and that's that customers have now come to grips that they all have to get at this and accelerate their own technology platform and climate change issues and opportunities and so that accelerating demand opportunities is going to open up and expand our total available market and create significant opportunity for Jacobs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Just as we think about -- thinks of this migration sort of more up market, higher margin business mix over time, just curious how you'd reflect on the win rate in some of those higher margin adjacencies through fiscal '20? And as you think about Focus 2023 does that program potentially drive that adjacent market win rate materially higher over time?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes. Let me, at a high level again and it's great that you asked that question because it feeds right into the whole Focus 2023 initiative. It is all about moving into more and more higher value markets that we believe have a long runway of opportunity and so it's, when we talk about connectivity and climate change resiliency what's going to -- the whole dynamic of what's going to happen with healthcare moving forward and really all aspects of both our Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places Solutions business it's exactly what fits into what is the question that you asked, is that it is going to be moving into the higher market opportunities. And as I just answered the previous question, we believe that the total market that we're going to be going after over the next several years is going to be significantly expanded versus what we've been addressing over the last, say, five years because of the whole technology dynamics that have evolved over the last 12 months. Bob, do you want to kind of give some specific examples around that?\nBob Pragada: Yes, absolutely. Just to add on to what Steve as told, the win rates have been high and we expect them to be -- continue to be higher, but the client challenge is if you look at five years ago versus now, the current challenges are the same. These other dynamics that Steve was mentioning, or accentuating them. And so those challenges now need a different type of solution, which is where Focus 2023 comes into play. So an example, if -- one of the big areas that we have going on right now is around the use of hydrogen power, I'm sorry, hydrogen as a synthetic fuel and really addressing the decarbonization efforts that are going on both in the UK, the U.S., Australia, all over the world and whether it be for power generation for automotive, for ships, for airplanes, to power residential communities, it's across the board and Jacobs is right in the middle of all of that. So again the challenge of the stray away from fossil fuels, not a new one, but now with the advent of hydrogen and other synthetic fuels and the use of technology on how that support, something that we're right in the cross areas of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Co. Your line is now open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hi, good morning. Just on the virtualized environment, how do you differentiate Jacobs brand and recruit employees. Just as the friction for high value talent, it comes down with more virtualization kind of across the board. Can you just give us your thoughts on how Jacobs wins out? Could we see pricing competition for some high value talent and some of these green infrastructure areas go up? Or do you think you can access more talent globally, maybe push some of those acquisitions\u2019 costs down? Just curious what Jacobs has seen in this virtualized environment?\nBob Pragada: Great question. And it's the -- war on the talent hasn't slowed at all during the pandemic, that's for sure, but a couple of responses there. One is that we've used the word global integrated delivery, global connectedness, that matters. The folks that we see coming into the job force today are they care about what's going on globally and want to work on really, really neat stuff and that's a great attraction to Jacobs where if I may, either I'd spent half of my career in the mechanical engineering field or new graduate, but yet, I can use my domain expertise and now -- and now work on projects that are effectively changing the face of the world. Then I don't know of another recruiting tool that we could use as that. The virtual aspect of that, I talked about the positive, the other side of that ledger is that the demands on leadership become even higher because in a virtual world we need to make sure that we stay connected to our people and Steve and Kevin in the entire leadership team have really put a high level of focus on making sure that our newer employees feel connected to the culture of Jacobs through everything from town halls to increased communication etc. So there is a balance and it is a new world that we're really excited about.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, one thing Josh to augment Bob's comment is our attrition rates have continued to be very, very attractive and following. Now some of that could be affected and impacted by COVID, but the reality is with you -- with us being able to deliver, really, really good performance on lowering attrition rates it puts less pressure on attracting new talent, which is obviously a good thing from an economic perspective and capability perspective given our teams. So it works in a circular manner. In terms of focusing on our culture, making people excited and that ultimately translates to a really good picture going forward in terms of gaining access to talent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great, thanks. It is probably for Kevin. I guess I just want to understand the some of the moving pieces on the corporate cost related to fiscal '21, because I heard that there is already $75 million of kind of quick wins, I think you term then -- I think that -- I have to imagine $35 million of annual lease costs are part of that. I guess my question is, how much do you estimate that the headwind is from the low-cost in 2020? I guess you kind of talked about the fact that there was some deferred healthcare things because of COVID, other things like that that could be lower than expected SG&A in 2020. So I guess I'm just trying to understand if there is a net benefit from the actions that you've already taken here in early 2021 to deliver. I guess EBITDA dollar growth for those cost actions. Then I guess there is a similar implication, your question on 2020. It sounds like there is a good deal of reinvestment planned against that. I was hoping to I guess ask the separate ways, is there as you look to '22 and '23 as part of the three-year plan, is there a net benefit or do you expect that the majority of these savings will get reinvested?\nKevin Berryman: So that was a big question. And let me let me kind of parse it apart. So yes, the incremental cost that we are seeing in 2021 are a function of as we now see the light at the end of the tunnel relative to the COVID situation we're positioning ourselves to be reinvesting back into the business to accelerate our ability to deliver profitable growth as we exit this year and into 2022 and beyond. So that's a very clearly the case. And so if you think about that effectively what I guess I'd reemphasize, what I said during the prepared remarks was effectively that $75 million is offsetting some of these kind of come back in costs for 2021. And so as we go then into 2022 and beyond clearly Focus 2023 allows us to deliver incremental benefits and from our perspective, the way that we're envisioning that is, that gives us degrees of freedom to really significantly invest in some of the digitization, training, capability sets for us to deliver the next wave of innovative solutions that are higher margin and deliver even special more special solution to the clients. So as we sit here today, we say look we're going to invest back those incremental monies, but of course each of those incremental investments are going to have to have a return profile that makes sense from a shareholder perspective and if they don't, maybe some of that drops to the bottom line. But our attention on Focus 2023 really is about profitable higher margin growth going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Feniger: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I know we're running a little long. So I'll try to keep it short. Just first off with the pent-up demand that you guys are talking about, have you seen anything on the public or private side, with booking just start to fall in November after the election?\nSteve Demetriou: Michael, when you say fall, you mean to be awarded?\nMichael Feniger: Yes. If there was any fall or any pick up, you guys saw on bookings after the election increase of customer inquiries. Did anything really change in November that gives you guys confidence on the second half?\nSteve Demetriou: I don't know if it was directly affect -- I don't know if it was directly tied to the election, but we continue to see positive momentum in our bookings. Now is that coincidence if they were tied to November election or not, but probably not probably not appropriate for us to speculate on that. Programs have been coming in, we talked about the pipeline, the pipeline continues to be robust and we continue to win a fair share of those. So yes, I think they are two independent events.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Bob, there is a bullet on CMS slide that says KeyW geospatial technology for confidential commercial customer, that sounds kind of exciting. Can you talk about what that is? Maybe what that pretends for some of the government-related pursuit that KeyW was involved with geospatial? Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Joe, I got to be really careful with this one. It is a -- it is confidential, it's in the automotive sector and it really starts to rely on deep space satellite technology in order to advance all of the smart kind of capabilities that you would find in a commercial vehicle, but it's unique because it's gone to yet another domain, in order to get that information and really enhances speed and accuracy of what's being fed to cars on the road. So unfortunately that's probably all I could say about it at this point.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time, I'll turn the call back over for any closing remarks.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, thank you. Just to close out, since the pandemic started the safety and well-being of our people have been our top priority. And in parallel, we've worked hard to deliver on our client commitments. We're going to continue that focus in spite of the virus escalating around the world. Hopefully, you've got a flavor today that we continue to play a role in support of the major pharma clients in the front line of the vaccine therapeutic production and we're encouraged by the recent announcements on the vaccines. And as we close out this fiscal year, I'm proud of the performance we delivered in these unprecedented times and the credit goes to the ingenuity and dedication of all of our people. As a result, we're entering fiscal year 2021 from a position of strength in our key markets, and a collective determination to drive growth through innovative solutions for our clients. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Before I begin, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 included an extra week compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. While this impact was factored into our guidance, it represented approximately $100 million in a year-over-year net revenue tailwind for each of CMS and People & Places. Fourth quarter gross revenue, as a result, increased 4% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue up 2%. People & Places net revenue was up 8% year-over-year, and Critical Mission Solutions declined 3.6% on a pro forma basis. The CMS decline was mainly attributed to the early impact from transitioning off of two lower margin contracts, as I will explain later, in more detail. It is important to note CMS operating profit on a pro forma basis increased 14% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.5% down 135 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin was driven by a combination of factors primarily within People & Places, including overall revenue mix, the comparison versus a very strong year-ago quarter, the impact of some project closeout costs and the previously discussed flow-through effect of the reimbursable rate of a more efficient fixed cost structure in the LOB. The lower reimbursement rate for fixed cost is more than offset by the underlying lower level of G&A costs. This impact to reimbursable rates from our cost structure is also reflected, and overall, lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 100 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%. As it pertains to G&A, the fourth quarter continued to benefit from low travel and employee-related medical costs. GAAP operating profit was $22 million and included $211 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, of which the vast majority was associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $24 million of other charges consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $1 million of costs associated with the Worley transition services agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $258 million, up 2% from the prior year figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, a result of the lower People & Places margins discussed earlier. This was partially offset by improved critical emissions margins and flat year-over-year unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers of these costs on the line of business review slide. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $70 million and $0.53 per share and included $1.22 per share of after tax restructuring, transaction and other charges, as noted above, an amortization charge of acquired intangibles of $0.13, both of which were partially offset by a $0.34 net benefit, largely driven by the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.63, including a $0.24 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding these discrete great tax items in both the current and year ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was essentially flat year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $277 million and was up 1% year-over-year, reaching 9.8% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 for Q4, driven by solid bookings from both lines of business. As Bob noted, the over $400 million previously awarded Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management win remains in protest, and as a result, is excluded from our backlog figures. We expect to be notified of our resolution mid fiscal year 2021. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by strong new business dynamics within Critical Mission Solutions. We believe nearly all of the opportunities we are pursuing have strong bipartisan support as they are high-priority areas associated with national security. We believe that the People & Places Solutions business overall sales pipeline also supports strong long-term growth. We continue to see changes in the underlying composition and timing of opportunities driven by a more environmentally friendly U.S. administration as well as covered related impacts. Turning to Slide 10. Let me summarize our fiscal 2020 performance. For the full year, revenue increased 7% and net revenue increased 2.5% pro forma for the Wood Nuclear acquisition. GAAP operating profit was $536 million, and adjusted operating profit was $970 million, up 9% versus the year ago figures. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.05 billion and increased 7%, reaching 9.6% of net revenue. Our fiscal year 2020 book-to-bill was 1.07 times. And before leaving our consolidated annual results, I would like to make some summary comments regarding our first half and second half performance. Fiscal 2020 has been defined by a year of two very different halves. Prior to COVID, our first half performance was indicative of strong momentum, with pro forma growth net revenue growth of over 6% and double-digit pro forma operating profit growth, resulting in operating profit margins up 50 basis points year-over-year. As the pandemic took hold, our teams quickly adjusted plans for the second half of the year as we've recognized that physical distancing and economic disruption would impact our earlier revenue momentum. Revenue ended up being relatively flat in the second half versus both the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, indicating the resilience of our portfolio. Importantly, our teams were able to successfully manage to a lower cost structure than our original plan with costs reduced over $100 million during the second half versus our original plan. The agility of our teams to adjust rapidly was profound, and we are proud of them for having successfully mitigated the economic disruption to the Company and the impact to our clients. So regarding our LOB, let's turn to the Slide 11. Starting with CMS, as expected, pro forma revenue declined 3.6% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from the two large lower margin contracts we are transitioning off and the benefit of the extra week of revenue, growth would have also been down low single digits year-over-year, driven by the impacts associated with COVID-19. While revenue was down, CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with operating profit margin up 140 basis points year-over-year to 8.1%. Even factoring in the extra week in the fourth quarter, operating profit would have increased high single digits year-over-year. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities with some additional benefit from favorable project closeouts. From a full year perspective, pro forma revenue was down 1%, and operating profit on a pro forma basis increased 8%. Operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 7.5% from fiscal 2019 against -- again, consistent with our strategy consistent with our strategy to expand our CMS margins. Looking into fiscal 2021, we expect CMS reported net revenue to be up low single digits as we ramp new wins and benefit from newly acquired higher margin revenue. Given the strategy to capture higher value opportunities and the benefit from acquisitions, we expect reported operating profit growth to be up double digits. We do believe that the improvements will be more back half-oriented given the impact from the two lower margin contracts will be more than offset with the new higher-margin business later in the second half. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q4 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year but would have been relatively flat, excluding the benefit of the extra week during the fourth quarter. Operating profit was down 8% year-over-year. And as a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.2% for the quarter, down over 210 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by COVID-related headwinds in the quarter, some project closeout costs and the strong -- very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from project closeout benefits. From a full year perspective, PPS net revenue was up 6%, with operating profit up 4%, reaching an operating profit margin of 12.4%, slightly down versus a year ago due to pressure associated with COVID-19 in the second half. Looking forward, we expect People & Places revenue to be up low single digits for fiscal 2021, with relatively flat growth in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect operating profit margin as a percent of net revenue to increase modestly from fiscal 2020, given the higher-margin mix in our sales pipeline and lower costs from our focused -- Focus 2023 initiatives. These benefits will be largely offset in 2021 by additional costs as we transition from cost mitigation efforts executed during the second half of fiscal 2020 to a more sustainable cost structure in 2021 and beyond associated with driving profitable growth. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, flat from the year ago period. On an annual basis, non-allocated corporate costs were $143 million, up 9% year-over-year. Looking forward to 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher, driven mainly by inflation and medical costs, improved employee benefits and an increase in employee discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns. Now turning to Slide 12. I would like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integration. As Steve discussed, the pandemic has fundamentally changed nearly all facets of the economy, which has provided us the ability to challenge our current processes to reinvest how we deliver solutions to our customers in the future. During Q4, we formed a dedicated internal team with assistance from an external adviser to examine the future work and other transformational opportunities. We are embarking upon a strategic initiative, Focus 2023, that we believe will lead to enhanced employee experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth, high-margin opportunities and drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for improved longer-term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred a nearly $200 million charge related to our Focus 2023 initiative, of which there was only $1 million in cash outflow during the quarter. Of the charge, approximately 80% was related to noncash real estate lease impairments as we plan to decrease our fiscal footprint by over 30%. The remainder of the costs was related to strategically leaning out the organization. In 2021, we project that we will have more than another $30 million in one-time costs associated with our Focus 2023 initiative. Our initiative has already generated approximately $75 million in quick win cost savings in fiscal 2021. This is allowing the Company to offset the incremental cost noted earlier expected in fiscal 2021 as compared to our lower cost structure associated with our COVID mitigation efforts in fiscal year 2020. In addition, it's expected that the run rate of these quick wins will provide another $25 million in savings in 2022 as we realize the full annual run rate benefits into the next year. Beyond these quick one savings, we believe there are substantial additional benefits approaching another $100 million into 2022 and 2023, which we will believe support incremental investments that will accelerate our growth and drive towards a more digital, innovative company that provides unique value-added solutions to our clients. We will provide additional detail of our Focus 2023 initiative during our expected Investor Day in the first half of calendar year 2021 and provide an update on our FY '21 Q1 earnings call. Now turning to our acquisition of Wood's Nuclear business. We are on track to achieve our targeted $12 million in run rate cost savings and the business continues to perform in line with our original target despite top line headwinds from headwinds from physical distancing. And finally, the acquisition of The Buffalo Group was announced today. While terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the acquisition is expected to deliver $0.08 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. And the cost of the acquisition adjusted EBITDA when including the tax benefits from the acquisition. And finally, when including all initiatives, including Focus 2023 and all M&A efforts, we expect the total estimated amount of approximately $80 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows during fiscal 2021. Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 13. During the quarter, we generated $403 million in free cash flow as a result of very strong collections and lower headwinds from cash restructuring. Q4 cash flow included a positive $23 million of net one-time benefits primarily due to a pandemic related cash tax deferral, partly offset by headwinds from cash outflows associated with restructuring and other items. For fiscal year 2020, we generated $689 million in free cash flow above our original expectation. Our annual free cash flow included $10 million of net nonrecurring outflows. When excluding this $10 million net headwind for the full year, the Company delivered a 96% free cash flow conversion to our adjusted net income figure for the year, demonstrating the strong free cash flow capabilities of the business. Over the medium term, we continue to target 100% conversion of recurring cash flow from adjusted net earnings. As previously stated, we expect approximately $110 million cash outflows related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring and integration during fiscal 2021. We also expect a reversal of pandemic-related UK payroll tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2020 of at least $40 million. That results in an expected total headwind of $150 million of cash outflows in the fiscal year 2021, including these one-time items. DSO performance in Q4 was the major driver to our improved free cash flow improvement, down almost nine days, excuse me, from 3Q 2020 as many of the collection process improvement initiatives implemented gain traction. We are focused on maintaining this lower DSO level, which will be a major driver to our ability to deliver a 1x free cash flow conversion target long term. And now moving to the balance sheet. Given the strong free cash flow for the quarter and year, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $900 million and a gross debt of $1.7 billion, resulting in $800 million in net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.5 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regarding capital deployment, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million worth of our shares. For modeling purpose, we would expect an average share count of $131 million for the first quarter 2021 and fiscal year 2021, excluding additional material share buyback activity. Of course, as Steve noted in his opening comments, our plan is to proactively deploy our capital as we plan for the transition out of a COVID-19 environment. Regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the fiscal 2021 year, in line with our longer-term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased earlier this year and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year ago. Now, I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on Slide 14. Good morning, Yes. Jerry, so if you think about the savings associated with the Focus 2023, I already quoted some of the numbers, but to note that couple of hundred million dollars, almost $200 million of one-time costs that's primarily associated with lease impairment cost non-cash charge. And if you think about what that translates into in terms of the reduction in the -- let's call it the real estate costs going forward, it's roughly $35 million, of which, the vast majority is associated with a reduction in lease costs. So, as you think about that, there is obviously much more savings on top of that, which totaled to the $75 million we talked about with a run rate of an additional $100 million. Those are related to the initiatives about leaning out the organization and the efficiencies gained with ultimately the investments in tools and capabilities and training associated with the Focus '23. It is really clear that we've learned a ton during these last nine months and we're taking full advantage of that and being proactive and leaning forward to, to help take these learnings and create something even better for ourselves and our clients, and our people going forward. Yes, look, I think as you -- before COVID, actually, the People & Places business was pretty much on target to deliver that, that kind of margin target in 2020 and then got disrupted little bit given the second-half of the year, Joe. But I think that at the end of the day, we're going to be right close to those kind of figures in 2020 -- 2021 fiscal year. On CMS, I think, we're going to be right there in terms of the margin targets that we had characterized back in 2016, kind of mid-8s, hopefully, maybe a little bit higher, but I think that that's what our expectations are for CMS. So, I think we're right there. You have noted in our comments that the CMS margins are going to be driven by a relatively lower revenue growth because we're working off some of these other longer-term contracts, but that could be replaced by a more robust margin profile business over the course of 2021, leading to a really strong margin profile consistent with what the original targets were for 2021. I would echo the same thing, Steve, that you reemphasized the fact that the Focus 2023 really is while we're getting some cost efficiencies here that the intention is that we're going to be able to reinvest back into some of the digital capabilities that we know are there, which facilitate our ability to win solutions with our clients or deliver solutions to our clients that ultimately are associated with a higher margin profile. So, really is about growth, and it really is about a margin profile longer-term that we would expect to see upward trajectory versus kind of the 2021 figures. So, thanks for that question. I would say a couple things. One that I hope you're right that we will perform better than those numbers, first comment. But I think, as we think about the balance of next year, the back half of 2020 did have some challenges relative to our revenue being less robust than what we would originally assumed. So, as you think about the working capital dynamics associated with that number in the back half of the year, at the end there is some tailwinds, because we don't have as much of a bills and the working capital numbers in 2020. As we transition to 2021, and if we get to the conversion numbers we're actually talking to, actually we're making further improvements in DSOs because you're now facing an investment back into working capital. So, at the end of the day, we think it's a continuation of that journey to get to that one-time conversion number, which I've always kind of targeted the year 2022 as to getting there. Yes, Chad, let me take a crack at that and respond. Look, we recognize that our range here is relatively wide. But we also recognize that we continue to be in the midst of a pandemic. And while we feel really good of our ability to have done a great job in the second half of 2020 to mitigate some of the challenges associated with it, we still are in the midst of it. And so I think the low end of our range would be something that we hope never happens, but it would be a situation where the economics are challenged around the globe and that will have situation of that -- of that magnitude, which by the way still results in our ability to be flat versus year ago in a dire economic environment. That's how we would characterize the low end of our range. At the high end of the range, we're starting to be more optimistic as we come out of the dynamic associated with COVID and that we are developing the momentum that we actually think will happen into 2022 faster. So I think that's how we would characterize the range. I think we're being prudent by putting that range there and hopefully it gives you some constructive use as to see what the potential downside is under a pretty bad scenario and what the potential upside is under a good scenario. Yes, Steven, this is Kevin. I'll just reinforce what I said earlier, I think the first half is more flattish relative to our net revenue figures and back half is less flat, it starts to show some momentum. And so I think that that's how we would see the cadence. We're still in the midst of the pandemic, certainly we feel like we're going to be holding serve relative to our first six months. And given all the strong work that we're doing on everything else, we're going to see some actual margin improvements and profit improvements in the first half, but the revenue cadence is probably little bit more flattish in the first half developing additional momentum in the second half. So that was a big question. And let me let me kind of parse it apart. So yes, the incremental cost that we are seeing in 2021 are a function of as we now see the light at the end of the tunnel relative to the COVID situation we're positioning ourselves to be reinvesting back into the business to accelerate our ability to deliver profitable growth as we exit this year and into 2022 and beyond. So that's a very clearly the case. And so if you think about that effectively what I guess I'd reemphasize, what I said during the prepared remarks was effectively that $75 million is offsetting some of these kind of come back in costs for 2021. And so as we go then into 2022 and beyond clearly Focus 2023 allows us to deliver incremental benefits and from our perspective, the way that we're envisioning that is, that gives us degrees of freedom to really significantly invest in some of the digitization, training, capability sets for us to deliver the next wave of innovative solutions that are higher margin and deliver even special more special solution to the clients. So as we sit here today, we say look we're going to invest back those incremental monies, but of course each of those incremental investments are going to have to have a return profile that makes sense from a shareholder perspective and if they don't, maybe some of that drops to the bottom line. But our attention on Focus 2023 really is about profitable higher margin growth going forward."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business performed well, demonstrating CMS' resiliency and alignment to the diverse set of high-value sectors we serve, such as national security, space exploration, intelligence, nuclear life cycle solutions and the deployment of 5G infrastructure. Total CMS backlog is at $9.1 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis and does not include our previously awarded King's Bay intelligent asset management win, which we fully expect a clear protest in early April. Importantly, approximately half of our bookings during the fourth quarter were from new business. Good morning. Adding to the first one, I missed the second part of the question. Could you repeat the second part? Okay, great. Yes, on the first one, the small business set asides we took a really strong look at that and these -- not just these recent awards, but then the trend that we see going forward with regards to the areas of the government that the Buffalo Group is involved with are full and open. So we don't really see that the small business set asides of the past affecting how we see the real synergies that the platform is going to bring to our overall business. So we're optimistic on that front, and then Steve, you want to add? Sure. Mike, let me just kind of take it one at a time. Private sector, you know it is really well long-term -- long-term relationships that we have with the private sector clients that we haven't. So if you look at what does that mean for Jacobs, predominantly in the manufacturing space as well as a bit on the environmental side with regards to other industrial clients, we're actually starting to see a bit of an uptick as those clients really look at not only the portfolio mix, but also how they reorganized their global supply chain as a result of the learnings from COVID. So a bit of -- it's -- and it kind of touches the profile of services that we offer. So we can help them with regards to conceptual planning and kind of looking at helping them solve those solutions with other innovations that we have on how they look at that. So on the private sector side, we're starting to see, we have visibility to where those will materialize into other downstream projects and we're in that phase right now. Public sector, steady business and that's a global comment and I'll come back to kind of a nuance between international and U.S., but we are seeing in the U.S. public sector is that the creativity that state and local government have already exhibited for the better part of the last three years to four years has continued, And with some of the extensions, whether it be continuing resolution extension within the government or it would be on the bond measures that have 31 of the 44 bond measures passed in this last election, they're utilizing those types of measures in order to continue on the projects, whether it be in transit or in water. Stimulus would be added to that, we monitor ourselves over what we could see. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the U.S. and the international side the stimulus money is already is -- we're starting to see some effect of that specifically in UK with the 10 point plan already starting to see some early planning work around that. And then in Australia, we're already starting to see some of the effects of those of those money flowing through. So overall we are well positioned for whichever -- whichever way the markets go. Yes, absolutely. Just to add on to what Steve as told, the win rates have been high and we expect them to be -- continue to be higher, but the client challenge is if you look at five years ago versus now, the current challenges are the same. These other dynamics that Steve was mentioning, or accentuating them. And so those challenges now need a different type of solution, which is where Focus 2023 comes into play. So an example, if -- one of the big areas that we have going on right now is around the use of hydrogen power, I'm sorry, hydrogen as a synthetic fuel and really addressing the decarbonization efforts that are going on both in the UK, the U.S., Australia, all over the world and whether it be for power generation for automotive, for ships, for airplanes, to power residential communities, it's across the board and Jacobs is right in the middle of all of that. So again the challenge of the stray away from fossil fuels, not a new one, but now with the advent of hydrogen and other synthetic fuels and the use of technology on how that support, something that we're right in the cross areas of. Great question. And it's the -- war on the talent hasn't slowed at all during the pandemic, that's for sure, but a couple of responses there. One is that we've used the word global integrated delivery, global connectedness, that matters. The folks that we see coming into the job force today are they care about what's going on globally and want to work on really, really neat stuff and that's a great attraction to Jacobs where if I may, either I'd spent half of my career in the mechanical engineering field or new graduate, but yet, I can use my domain expertise and now -- and now work on projects that are effectively changing the face of the world. Then I don't know of another recruiting tool that we could use as that. The virtual aspect of that, I talked about the positive, the other side of that ledger is that the demands on leadership become even higher because in a virtual world we need to make sure that we stay connected to our people and Steve and Kevin in the entire leadership team have really put a high level of focus on making sure that our newer employees feel connected to the culture of Jacobs through everything from town halls to increased communication etc. So there is a balance and it is a new world that we're really excited about. Joe, I got to be really careful with this one. It is a -- it is confidential, it's in the automotive sector and it really starts to rely on deep space satellite technology in order to advance all of the smart kind of capabilities that you would find in a commercial vehicle, but it's unique because it's gone to yet another domain, in order to get that information and really enhances speed and accuracy of what's being fed to cars on the road. So unfortunately that's probably all I could say about it at this point."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 business performance and strategy update. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy as the pandemic continues to impact all facets of our daily lives and our loved ones. As we work with our pharma supply chain to support the development and distribution of a vaccine, we must not lose sight of the severity of the situation globally. Here at Jacobs, aligned with our core value of we do things right, we will continue to prioritize the health of our employees and our communities. During this pandemic, we have prudently adjusted our cost structure while continuing key strategic investments to position Jacobs to accelerate growth as the economy recovers. We have continued to take deliberate strategic actions to drive inclusivity and diversity of thought across Jacobs as well as making targeted investments to accelerate our digital capabilities. We strongly believe these investments position Jacobs to capture a compelling growth opportunity to emerge as a uniquely positioned strategic consultant and delivery partner across a diverse set of sectors where we have deep domain expertise. All right. Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.055 billion to $1.155 billion, which represents year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be a range of $5.20 to $6. It's important to note that our guidance does not include any benefit from material future share repurchase activity. We do expect to fully utilize our balance sheet capacity over time through share repurchases or acquisitions that provide returns in excess of back. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth to rebound to double-digit adjusted EBITDA as we benefit from our Focus 2023 initiative as well as potential infrastructure-related stimulus and economic recovery. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Good morning, Jerry. Jerry, just sort of at a high level, the two major pillars, really, and the first one is really growth. It's all about driving the next-generation technology growth. We've obviously learned a lot over this past 10 months, 11 months with what happened during the pandemic, and it's really given us tremendous opportunity to accelerate our solution set across a variety of sectors that Bob really covered in both LOBs. And the second pillar is delivering our work more efficiently, effectively. We have a huge opportunity with what we outlined with regard to the way we're going to have a much more dynamic operating model moving forward with flexible workspace, continued remote working. So, a significant opportunity to reduce cost, but that goes far beyond just the real estate and travel. It's really back office efficiency, procurement and a whole host of other things that should deliver significant cost savings. So, those are sort of the combinations that -- again together unleashes a growth trajectory for Jacobs moving forward. Kevin, on -- some more on the financial side. Yes, just Jamie to start with -- hand it back to Kevin for maybe some more financial back up is that, yes, we expect the Focus 2023 to give us incremental margin improvement as we get beyond 2021. It's one of the major opportunities and objectives of that initiative. And the Buffalo acquisition is accretive to CMS margins. So, it's going to enhance that on top of what I just said. And so I think the combination of those two, as well as the backlog profile we have and looking at the -- some of the multi-year aspects of that backlog and the higher margins in the current backlog as we move forward, gives us confidence for multi-year margin improvement. Kevin? Yes, on the overall M&A pipeline, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about essentially going back to our 2019 strategy Investor Day, and that is as we just did with The Buffalo Group, we'll continue to look at ways to strengthen our government services business and move up the value chain there. From an overall Company standpoint, we've talked about digital consulting, strategic consulting becoming a bigger end-to-end player, especially on the front end, geographic expansion is another area. So, just very consist of staying core to our strategy. Yes, Michael part two of your question, I think it's a combination of pent-up demand and accelerating demand over the course of the next 12 months to 24 months. And what I mean by that is pent-up side obviously things like the fact that the life science, pharma industry has been totally focused on COVID-19, but there's a whole host of opportunities there that they need to get back at around oncology and biotech, etc., you think of the whole aging infrastructure dynamics in the U.S. and the UK and other areas that have to be addressed. And I think those two regions specifically the government is now set up to hopefully live up to strong stimulus and funding around infrastructure the next several years. But then you've got the whole accelerating demand that we talked about, which is really driving our Focus 2023 initiative and that's that customers have now come to grips that they all have to get at this and accelerate their own technology platform and climate change issues and opportunities and so that accelerating demand opportunities is going to open up and expand our total available market and create significant opportunity for Jacobs. Yes. Let me, at a high level again and it's great that you asked that question because it feeds right into the whole Focus 2023 initiative. It is all about moving into more and more higher value markets that we believe have a long runway of opportunity and so it's, when we talk about connectivity and climate change resiliency what's going to -- the whole dynamic of what's going to happen with healthcare moving forward and really all aspects of both our Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places Solutions business it's exactly what fits into what is the question that you asked, is that it is going to be moving into the higher market opportunities. And as I just answered the previous question, we believe that the total market that we're going to be going after over the next several years is going to be significantly expanded versus what we've been addressing over the last, say, five years because of the whole technology dynamics that have evolved over the last 12 months. Bob, do you want to kind of give some specific examples around that? Yes, one thing Josh to augment Bob's comment is our attrition rates have continued to be very, very attractive and following. Now some of that could be affected and impacted by COVID, but the reality is with you -- with us being able to deliver, really, really good performance on lowering attrition rates it puts less pressure on attracting new talent, which is obviously a good thing from an economic perspective and capability perspective given our teams. So it works in a circular manner. In terms of focusing on our culture, making people excited and that ultimately translates to a really good picture going forward in terms of gaining access to talent. Michael, when you say fall, you mean to be awarded? I don't know if it was directly affect -- I don't know if it was directly tied to the election, but we continue to see positive momentum in our bookings. Now is that coincidence if they were tied to November election or not, but probably not probably not appropriate for us to speculate on that. Programs have been coming in, we talked about the pipeline, the pipeline continues to be robust and we continue to win a fair share of those. So yes, I think they are two independent events. Yes, thank you. Just to close out, since the pandemic started the safety and well-being of our people have been our top priority. And in parallel, we've worked hard to deliver on our client commitments. We're going to continue that focus in spite of the virus escalating around the world. Hopefully, you've got a flavor today that we continue to play a role in support of the major pharma clients in the front line of the vaccine therapeutic production and we're encouraged by the recent announcements on the vaccines. And as we close out this fiscal year, I'm proud of the performance we delivered in these unprecedented times and the credit goes to the ingenuity and dedication of all of our people. As a result, we're entering fiscal year 2021 from a position of strength in our key markets, and a collective determination to drive growth through innovative solutions for our clients. Thank you."

With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: All right. Thank you, Jon. And thanks everyone for joining us today to discuss our third quarter business performance and strategy update. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to occupy our time, as leaders, we must not lose sight on speaking up for what's right. Earlier today, we launched Jacobs\u2019 Global Action Plan for advancing justice and equality, which was developed in a direct response to recent social and racial injustices. For the last several years, I've been pleased with Jacobs\u2019 industry-leading progress on building a high-performance culture, led by our focus on inclusion and diversity, which we call TogetherBeyond. We believe this has been a critical success factor in driving improved performance and shareholder returns. Today's launch of Jacobs\u2019 Advancing Justice and Equality Action Plan is our next phase of this journey and holds on are TogetherBeyond strategy with the four primary pillars centered around culture building and engagement; leadership, commitment and accountability; developing talent; and growing the business. This action plan is about achieving true equality for all our employees, current and future, with a priority now on ensuring black employees have unquestionable equal opportunity and the tools needed to advance and achieve their ultimate goals at Jacobs. I'm proud of the employee engagement in the development of this action plan, starting with the team, who collaborated alongside Jacobs' Board of Directors and our executive leadership team to outline transparent, specific and measurable actions. First commitment is amplifying a culture of belonging by expanding our existing Conscious Inclusion program through Bystander Intervention training with the commitment to training our 55,000-person global workforce by the end of fiscal year 2021. Engaging 3,000 Jacobs\u2019 leaders and meaningful dialogues on antiracism to expand their focus on justice and equality. Driving personal accountability of senior leadership for inclusion by tying individual inclusion and diversity performance plan to compensation. And adding Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a U.S. holiday, encouraging employees to engage in volunteer opportunities around equality of justice. Our second commitment is to recruit, retain and advance black employees based on merit by increasing the representation of black employees at all levels over the next three years to proportionally reflect the overall external population. To accomplish this, we are increasing our leadership development programs to accelerate advancement for black employees to all levels of leadership, requiring all senior leaders to sponsor and mentor at least one black employee and ensure global reach to these efforts, and further strengthening the diversity Jacobs\u2019 Board of Directors including black representation. This has been a success area for our Board over the last four years, but one that can be continually improved as Board members retire and as we appoint highly talented diverse contributors. Our third commitment is about driving structural change in the broader society. To meet this commitment, we'll donate $10 million over the next five years in support of black educational and professional development opportunities that include two specific areas. Supporting primary and secondary education programs, focused on science, technology, engineering, arts and math, to prepare black students for esteemed professions. And providing financial support for scholarship, mentoring and internship opportunities at Jacobs for black high school and college students. In addition to that investment, we're also promoting programs with organizations committed to justice and equality through collectively, Jacobs\u2019 giving and volunteering platform including leveraging our expertise in areas like water for at-risk urban and rural communities. And materially increasing the percentage of Jacobs spend over the next five years with women and minority owned suppliers and vendors. To drive this action plan and our global IND strategy, we have appointed Jeff Dingle as Vice President of TogetherBeyond. Advancing justice and equality requires strong leadership and a relentless drive to deliver on the vision. And Jeff is the right person to lead this important work and grow a culture where employees want to join, stay and thrive. Ultimately, we must create a culture in which every person can access a future of opportunities, contributing to a structural change that Jacobs and in the broader society is about doing our part as a global leader. The time is now for us to get this right, once and for all. Turning to slide 5 to discuss our continued focus on keeping our people safe during the pandemic and how we're supporting clients to solve COVID-19 challenges. As we approach five months of battling the coronavirus, we remain focused on keeping our people safe first and foremost, and delivering on our commitments to our clients. As the duration of the pandemic has extended, Jacobs\u2019 strong culture of caring and particularly our emphasis on employee wellbeing has really come to the forefront. Our teams have responded with new programs for engaging our people in supportive ways, including deep dive series on mental health resiliency. Situation continues to be fluid, and as a global company, the variability from location to location is dramatic. Our crisis management teams continue to monitor and respond to the pandemic in our local areas. And with regard to our efforts around a return to the workplace, we are demonstrating flexibility to fit the needs of our people and our clients, while accelerating our future of work strategy. Our efforts in supporting our clients and communities in fighting COVID-19 include on the treatment side, our world leading pharmaceutical solutions team playing a major role in the retrofit of facilities to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our teams are also supporting clients of public health response strategies in U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand. And from a solution standpoint, we're deploying our proprietary ION technology for contact tracing with pharmaceutical clients at large scale facilities. We're developing scenario modeling software being used by transit clients around the globe, and digital monitoring of waste streams for COVID-19 at municipal water treatment plants. Turning to slide 6. Our business, which at its core, solves highly technical scientific-based challenges across a variety of sectors, proved its resiliency in one of the most abrupt global disruptive shocks that we have experienced. Part of our resiliency is driven by an alignment to high-value sectors of the global economy, such as national security, water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, healthcare and life sciences, intelligent asset management, space exploration and the convergence of information and operational technology. In addition to deep technical expertise, we benefit from economies of scale in both our businesses. This provides us the ability to quickly adjust to global changes in demand and manage our cost structure. More importantly, our culture fosters strong business acumen and innovative thinking to adapt rapidly to shifts in demand. While we were certainly impacted by the pandemic during our third quarter, from a financial standpoint, we showed solid performance during the quarter with pro forma backlog up 4%. Adjusted operating profit was up 3% year-over-year as we quickly transitioned to the new virtual work environment with strong productivity, while carefully managing discretionary spending. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $332 million and now expect reported fiscal 2020 free cash flow to approach $400 million. Overall, we witnessed better than expected performance in the third quarter, given the ability to proactively work with our clients to overcome physical distancing requirements. Considering this third quarter performance and our initial view of our fourth quarter, we're raising our fiscal 2020 outlook. COVID-19 will continue to impact us in the fourth quarter, and likely provide challenges into early fiscal 2021. For the full fiscal 2021, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth with potential infrastructure stimulus providing upside relative to these expectations. Finally, we continue to maintain healthy financial flexibility with ample liquidity that can be prudently deployed toward high-return opportunities. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the third quarter, our CMS business performed better than the COVID outlook we provided in the second quarter. Our solid third quarter results demonstrate CMS\u2019s resiliency and agility to work and perform at the highest levels for our clients. Though we will continue to be in COVID impacted environment through early fiscal 2021, our performance has been encouraging. The ability to recover from the shutdown despite physical distancing occurred faster than originally anticipated as our workforce and clients have addressed challenges and continue to execute on our contracts, regardless of work location. The underlying structural demand for our services remained strong. And as a result, total CMS backlog is now at $9.1 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. While a portion of our CMS portfolio can be performed remotely, we did see some impact in our long-term enterprise contracts that involve highly technical work on client sites. Some elements of these stable and resilient contracts did experience temporary impacts from physical distancing protocols. Let me share with you some details on the impact along with some notable wins by sector. Our U.S. federal civilian business makes up about 35% of CMS\u2019s revenue, with the majority of the revenue coming from our NASA and DOE clients. As we\u2019ve shared with you in the past, Jacobs provides broad support to NASA in its accelerated work to meet the current administration's mandate to return to the moon in 2024. NASA must make progress towards these national goals, despite the challenges of working remotely and the reduced on-site workforce. At the end of our second quarter, we anticipated a low overall impact at NASA in the second half of fiscal year \u201820. Through the third quarter, that has been the actual case, as most of our workers have transitioned well to working remotely or operating within on-site physical distancing guidelines. Our NASA portfolio is expected to return to full capacity as we approach the end of our fiscal year. As NASA's largest provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of NASA's Artemis program -- excuse me, largest services provider of many aspects of NASA's Artemis program to extend the frontiers of human deep space exploration, sending humans to the moon by 2024, then to Mars and beyond. I would like to highlight a couple of achievements. A major milestone was reached in June when the solid rocket boosters arrived at the Kennedy Space Center to power NASA's Space Launch System. The Jacobs team handles final checkout and integration of all flight hardware for Artemis mission and is currently working on the integration of this hardware. Jacobs NASA team was also recently featured in wired magazine for utilizing artificial intelligence and generative design algorithms to build components for NASA's next generation spacesuit, the first major update in decades. Moving on to our nuclear portfolio. Last quarter, we'd anticipated this business would be moderately impacted by physical distancing constraints, resulting in a decrease in on-site workforce. Despite these headwinds, through the achievement of a few key performance milestones, several contract extension and overall business efficiencies, the nuclear portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter. Now, moving on to the U.S. Intelligence Community, which contributes just over 20% of CMS\u2019s revenue. Our Mission IT, C5ISR and Cyber businesses provide solutions to the sector. Last quarter, we had anticipated a moderate impact in Q3 from physical distancing headwinds at secured sites that would require split shifts. Based on actual results in Q3, we are now back at approximately 80% of normal operating levels and we expect all sites to be back to approximately 90% by the end of the fiscal year. In line with our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, it is important to note that we are transitioning off a lower margin classified procurement contract, which will impact short-term revenue growth during our fourth quarter, but has little impact to operating profit. As a result, our unit margins will benefit. Kevin will provide further details in his remarks. Our Mission IT business was awarded two notable contracts during the quarter for both -- both for the Department of Justice. The first is a three-year contract to modernize mission critical applications; and the second will provide software and network dev op support for the clients next generation laboratory information system. Additionally, in our space ISR business, we progressed to the next phase of a highly classified space solution, further solidifying Jacobs\u2019 position as a disruptor in this high-growth, high-margin sector. Shifting to the U.S. Department of Defense sector, which makes up approximately 20% of CMS\u2019s revenue, we provide a wide range of mission critical services performed at government sites or in highly secure facilities. At the end of Q2, we had anticipated much of our work at the military test ranges and classified skiffs to be moderately impacted by physical distancing requirements, actual performance matched our expectations. However, these impacts were partially mitigated by our work at the missile defense agency and positive performance in our cyber portfolio. Overall, these sites are now executing at approximately 80% of normal operating levels, and we expect our DOD work to ramp up to approximately 95% as we approach the end of the calendar year. Jacobs\u2019 continues to win new large enterprise contracts and raise its profile across the Department of Defense. For the Air Force, Jacobs was awarded a $434 million six-year contract with the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, providing system support and integration. Additionally, for the Navy Kings Bay facility, we were awarded a contract to deliver our intelligent asset management solution. Neither award is included in our Q3 backlog, but we recently received news that NORAD cleared the pro test [ph] period and will be included in our Q4 backlog. We remain encouraged that our Kings Bay will also successfully clear pro test. Shifting now to our commercial business. This business makes up just under 10% of our CMS\u2019s revenue. In telecom, we provide solutions for the buildout of 5G networks, a business that was impacted more severely than anticipated in Q3, from access limitations at some sites. We expect this business to strengthen over the next couple of quarters and return to its strong long-term demand rates thereafter. For the automotive sector, we primarily design and operate aerodynamic wind tunnels and provide general technical services, engineering and testing of automotive engines. Anticipated delayed awards Q3 did occur as our auto clients reevaluate their CapEx portfolios and future demand requirements. We expect a slower return to normal levels later in fiscal year \u201821. Finally, our CMS international sector makes up 15% of CMS\u2019 revenue and includes nuclear lifecycle solutions, support for UK\u2019s Ministry of Defense on its continuous At Sea Deterrent program and air and land weapons program in the UK and Australia. Our actual Q3 impact was less than anticipated. Strong shift work execution and physical distancing practices resulted in better performance. We expect our international business to return to approximately 95% of its normalized run rate as we exit the fiscal year. In summary, our overall sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline of $30 billion with $9 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile. We continue to see strong structural demand for our CMS services, even as impacts resulting from COVID-19 continue. Given we are aligned to high-priority mission-critical areas of federal governments, we do not anticipate material impact to our outlook in the event there's a change in administration. Moving to our People & Places Solutions business on slide 8. Our P&PS business generated a strong quarter and backlog performance, up 4.3% over the same period last year and up 3.2% quarter-over-quarter with an increased gross profit and backlog across all geographies and sectors. Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.2 times. While our pipeline remains robust across all geographies, we remain sensitive to the timing of economic recovery and government stimulus funding. Our business is well-positioned to benefit from current stimulus funding bills under review in multiple geographies around the world. Last quarter, I spoke about the anticipated COVID-19 impact to our People & Places Solutions business from a geographic and industry sector standpoint, as well as how we have optimized our delivery admits the pandemic. I'm pleased to say that overall, we are performing better than the moderate impact scenario we expected with most of our existing projects continuing and minimal to moderate delays in new awards. The diversity and resilience of our business and the ability to draw upon market, global and digital conductivity to deliver lasting and relevant solutions to our customers has been the key differentiator for us. Beginning with our buildings and infrastructure geographies, the Americas, including federal and environmental services business continues to be one of our best-performing and most resilient geographies with minimal impacts from COVID-19 to-date. Our federal infrastructure and water sectors continue to outperform, and we are retaining some of the best talent in the industry, resulting in strong revenue growth year-over-year. Demonstrating the depth and breadth of our solutions offering we were awarded several major projects in the portfolio, spanning multiple end market. For example, we've been selected for the design of $130 million drinking water pipeline for the Great Lakes Water Authority in Detroit. In Texas, we were selected for the Interstate Highway 35 Mobility program which will improve conductivity for all forms of transit across 80 miles of I-35. And we were awarded a major follow-on contract with FEMA for continued hurricane recovery efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We anticipate continued steady performance. However, delays and stimulus funding could affect the timing of new awards in FY21. In our Europe and Middle East business, recent UK government funding authorizations for environmental and water programs, including a recent award with Anglian Water Services show promise amidst continued Brexit-related slowdowns. The Anglian Water strategic pipelines alliance will deliver a new connected infrastructure, leveraging technology such as digital twins to drive greater efficiency and reliability. In our Middle East business, we're observing prioritized investments in water and transportation infrastructure. We remain cautiously optimistic on expectations for recovery in both of these geographies later in fiscal year 2021. Our Asia Pacific business performed better than anticipated. In Australia, New Zealand, we experienced material growth in the quarter and are up year-on-year on both revenue and operating profit. We converted our pipeline into several major wins in cloud computing and healthcare and are leveraging our global delivery capabilities. Southeast Asia remains steady with some project-related delays due to the pandemic and we anticipate some volatility into fiscal year '21. Building on our higher value solution capability, we have been selected as program manager for the new Noida International Airport in Delhi, India. We will provide strategic planning, risk management, digital solutions and program management for this new Greenfield development. We're applying our global integrated delivery model to provide leading solutions from around the world to this exciting project. Last quarter, we indicated that our advanced facilities business worldwide would likely experience positive effects from responding to the global pandemic. The demand for therapeutics and vaccine facilities is increasing. And we have drawn upon our global leadership to lock in several key wins in the quarter with several more in the pipeline. These projects tend to be shorter duration, high intensity projects, allowing us to leverage innovative and integrated delivery technique to meet demand. As an example, we're working with AstraZeneca to retrofit an existing fill finish manufacturing facility to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the market, as soon as late calendar year 2020, subject to clinical test results. We're also seeing an uptick in demand for data centers and semiconductor manufacturing due to increased cloud computing requirements. We have continued optimism for these businesses. I will now discuss our core sectors. Global mobility restrictions are easing in several regions and we are seeing a slow recovery in all modes of transportation. Early government relief funding has sustained many critical infrastructure projects and we're seeing continued investment in rail, including a recent award with transport from New South Wales to transform the rail network for communities across the Greater Sydney area. Additional global government stimulus is expected to include transportation related funding aimed at driving economic recovery. Although timing, trajectory and other key details remain uncertain. While our current business remains stable, continuing resolution and stimulus funding will drive growth opportunities. The water market continues to be resilient with long-term demand in both, upgrades to water infrastructure and utility operations and maintenance. Additionally, we continue to see ongoing growth in digital solutions including smart metering, AI, data analytics, automation and remote operations. While market indicators suggest CapEx pressure in 2021 and recovery into 2022, as the pandemic abates and stimulus funding becomes available, we still expect to maintain growth momentum driven by solid performance with our clients and superior expertise that effectively leverages tech-enabled solutions. The environmental sector is expected to see flat to moderate growth in 2021, with demand continuing steadily from federal and private clients, as well as stimulus related to investment in green and blue infrastructure. In addition to DoD client focus on PFAS, some states have established grant programs to address PFAS remediation. Further, we believe a focus on climate change initiatives will drive opportunities globally. We are well-positioned for continued growth and to capitalize on these new opportunities through trusted relationships with long-term clients, our diversity of markets in which we can apply innovative environmental solutions and strong retention of our global pool of expertise. In the built environment, which includes government facilities, healthcare, higher education and smart cities. We are seeing demand for repurposing business space as the need for a distributed work environment, and smart and sustainable buildings continues, allowing us to leverage our digital solutions. Our global healthcare crisis response team is combining multidisciplinary expertise from across the world to provide dynamic, forward-thinking, advisory and resilient solutions to a broad range of clients responding to the pandemic, as well as to those healthcare clients adapting to new healthcare service delivery models. Summing up the quarter. The negative effects of the global pandemic on growth in our People & Places Solutions business were partially offset by solid engagements with our core clients, and ongoing cost control. We continue to be proactive and agile to shifting market trends, which has resulted in a solid type of pipeline, and allows us to continue to drive our global, market and digital connectivity strategy. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. I'll discuss a more detailed summary now of our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on slide nine. Third quarter gross revenue increased 3% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue down 4%. PPS net revenue was flat year-over-year and CMS declined 9% on a pro forma basis. As Bob noted in his comments, the CMS decline was mainly attributed to physical distancing restrictions experienced to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.5%, down 35 basis points year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, the gross margin continues to face a headwind due to the flow-through effect on the reimbursable rate of our more efficient cost structure in PPS -- P&PS, positively offset by gross margin improvements in our CMS business. The lower reimbursement rate for fixed costs is more than offset by the underlying lower level of G&A costs, thus representing positive operating profit and margin impacts. This is reflected in lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 40 basis points year-over-year to 14.6%. During the current quarter, our G&A also benefited from lower travel and employee-related costs associated with actions taken to offset the short-term financial headwinds from COVID-19. Now that we have increased visibility into the dynamics of operating in the COVID-19 environment, we are adjusting our operating model accordingly and expect G&A as a percentage of revenue to increase modestly in the fourth quarter. GAAP operating profits improved substantially versus last year, driven by lower integration and divestiture-related costs, up 116% to $194 million and included $20 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, and $24 million of other charges consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, and $1 million of costs associated with Worley transition services agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $239 million, up 3% from the prior year figure. Our adjusted operating profits in net revenue was 8.9%, up 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by higher CMS and PPS margins, effectively offset by higher unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers of these costs on the next slide. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $227 million and $1.73 per share, and included a $0.71 net benefit, largely driven by the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake, and $0.11 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges as noted above, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was a $1.26 including a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year-ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was essentially flat year-over-year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $254 million or 9.5% of net revenue was down 2% year-over-year compared to the 3% increase in adjusted operating process, which was primarily due to a headwind from other income due to FX and non-controlling interest. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 for Q3, driven by the strong P&PS book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 times. CMS was -- book-to-bill was just under 1 times and reflected the burn off from Hanford Plateau. Importantly, the CMS Q3 backlog does not include our new awards at Navy Kings Bay and NORAD. The pipeline dynamics within CMS remain stable with no unusual delays or project cancellations. Within P&PS, the overall sales pipeline supports our top-line growth objectives, but we are seeing changes in the underlying composition of opportunities and timing on larger awards, which is reflected in our financial outlook. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to slide 10. Starting with CMS, pro forma revenue declined 8.6% year-over-year during the third quarter. CMS operating profits was $90 million and was up 17% year-over-year, but flat on a pro forma basis and well above our original expectation due to the COVID-19 dynamic. CMS operating profit margin was up 80 basis points year-over-year to 7.4%, overcoming the impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The upside versus our previous expectations were driven by a faster-than-expected transition to a virtual work environment and a return to COVID compliant onsite work environments. In line with our expectation, we also saw meaningful year-over-year decrease in lower margin procurement revenue, causing a top line headwind and an immaterial impact on OP dollar growth, given the lower margin associated with procurement related activities, resulting in a positive impact on OP margins. Also contributing to our OP growth was a milestone-based incentive fee that was achieved during the quarter. Please note, we are still experiencing material physical distancing limitation within our nuclear remediation efforts and for some secured work environments, as onsite access continues to be less than optimal, but we expect these operations to gradually improve utilization early into fiscal 2021. Also, in line with our CMS strategy of moving up the value stack, we expect margins to continue to improve over time as we pursue higher value opportunities. As we transition our CMS portfolio away from lower value services, such as procurement, we expect some short-term headwinds to revenue growth and a positive margin impact. Long-term, we continue to expect performance in line with our strategic long-term targets. Moving to people and places. Q3 net revenue was slightly down year-over-year. Let me provide more insight into the impacts associated with COVID-19. We and our clients swiftly moved to virtual work environments and our clients kept current projects continuing at historical burn rates. We saw continued strong underlying performance in the Americas even in the face of COVID. Net revenue increased double digits. Our advanced facilities customers initially slowed the pace of some projects as they digested the macro environment. However, they quickly shifted their CapEx plans to support potential COVID vaccines and therapies in addition to their current product mix. We continue to see headwinds in our UK business even after removing the physical distancing impact from COVID. That region's net revenue declined double-digits. While we are optimistic that the UK will begin to recover later in fiscal 2021, we remain cautious on the timing of that improvement. Operating profit was up 4%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 13% for the quarter, up over 50 basis points, both year-over-year and from Q2. Our P&PS margin was supported by adjusting our cost structure, by reducing discretionary spending, including travel and also benefited from lower employee related costs. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $41 million for quarter, up slightly from the Q2 figures and up from $27 million in the year ago period. A few discrete items contributed to the slightly higher costs, including some higher than normal legal and IT costs. We continue to target $35 million as the run rate outlook for unallocated corporate costs. Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a total reported net revenue to be up slightly year-over-year, which result in adjusted EBITDA up sequentially. This includes resuming some discretionary spend to position us for year-over-year growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Now, turning to Slide 11, I would like to update you on our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Regarding the sale of ECR, to-date, we have now incurred slightly over $250 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction separation and restructuring costs. We expect the remaining costs to be incurred over the remainder of the year. Turning to our acquisition of Woods Nuclear business, as a reminder, the transaction closed on March 6th. Integration continues to progress and we are on track to achieve our targeted $12 million run rate cost savings. Finally, we expect approximately $35 million of total charges in Q4 fiscal 2020 related to the ECR separation, wood cost to achieve synergies and other nonrecurring impacts, which is in line with the approximate $150 million in P&L costs that we have projected and expected over the course of this year. Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the quarter, we generated $332 million in free cash flow. Q3 cash flow was impacted by a net positive $25 million due to benefits from cash taxes, partly offset by headwinds from cash outflow associated with restructuring and other items. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect approximately $130 million of net nonrecurring outflows. Including these impacts, we continue to expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of fiscal 2020 with total reported free cash flow to now approach $400 million for the full year. As anticipated, DSOs were up from Q2 2020 and up year-over-year, as we expected some disruption from COVID-19. We still see ample opportunities to lower our DSO run rate, which will be a major driver for us attaining a one times free cash flow conversion target longer term. And now moving to the balance sheet. As the financial market stabilized over our fiscal third quarter, we repaid approximately $950 million on our revolving credit facility. We still ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.2 billion, resulting in $1.1 billion of net debt before attributing any benefits of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted EBIT 2020 EDA is just under 1 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regarding capital deployment, as we outlined last quarter, we paused our share purchases as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Our business proved out its expected resiliency and cash generation capabilities. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buyback activity going forward. For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of $132 million for the fourth quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2021, excluding additional share buybacks. Regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 in line with our longer term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased earlier this year and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus year ago. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on Slide 13.\nSteve Demetriou: All right. Thanks, Kevin. Now, let me review our total company outlook. Given our better than expected transition to a virtual work environment and the ramp up of on site operations, we\u2019re updating our fiscal 2020 outlook. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $1 billion to $1.50 billion from the $950 million to $1.50 billion. We are also updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.05 to $5.30, up from the $4.80 to $5.30 previous guidance. Importantly, at the midpoint of our revised EPS range, 2020 total fiscal year adjusted EPS represents year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from discrete tax items in both years. Let me also provide some insight to the COVID specific impact on this outlook. At the time of our second quarter earnings call, we communicated that we expected the gross impact to second half 2020 earnings would be approximate -- the net impact the second half fiscal 2020 earnings would be approximately $0.50 per share. However, as a result of our enhanced ability to adapt to physical distancing, we now expect a lower net impact from COVID of $0.35 per share. Given our success in adjusting our operations to a virtual work environment, we are further evaluating opportunities to significantly improve our efficiency through new structural changes to our future of work and look forward to sharing our strategy over the coming quarters. And looking into fiscal 2021, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth with the second half stronger than the first half performance. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, we'll now open the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: First question maybe for Bob. When you talked about in your prepared remarks looking at your P&PS business, and maybe a little bit more detail on the public funded versus private funded areas. Obviously, you mentioned some positive takeaways from some of the private sector advanced facilities work. How concerned are you relative to what we're seeing from Washington and the time lag relative to on the public side getting some of those projects that are on the books start to get some revenues flowing to the bottom line? Is that part of the caution that you're looking at the fiscal year, or say first calendar quarter of fiscal \u201821 moving into \u201821 going forward?\nBob Pragada: Michael, we\u2019re actually cautiously optimistic that something will be done. But in any scenario, the strength of our backlog right now is sustainable and resilient. So really when we talk about growth is really is the discussion around the dependence on stimulus. As far as a steady she goes, our backlog is represented back to date. So that kind of brings a little bit of the separation as being totally and solely dependent on those that are being discussed right now, become more of a topic later in the fiscal year, next year.\nMichael Dudas: And when you talk about from the private sector on the advanced facilities on the vaccines and such and data centers and the technology side, but you say its high intensity, that could be a positive surprise impact to \u201821 revenue, \u201821, \u201822 revenue or booking flows and is that something that's much more real behind the scenes and maybe what we\u2019re seeing from the news going on in the marketplace that there\u2019s certainly quite a bit of that in those sectors?\nBob Pragada: And Michael, you've been with us for a long time, you know how well positioned we are there too. So, we see the short term book and burn component of that being a real positive for us. And we're seeing, I would call, we're in the early innings of what that could mean for the business, specifically our positioning with these clients that we've had for several decades.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: It could be Bob or Steve, I think every defence company's being asked now how sensitive their business is due to defence budgets over the next few year. So I want to ask you that but maybe in a slightly different way. I think a significant aspect of the CMS strategy or at least a big part of the pipeline at CMS relates to weapons and program sustainment and that the opportunity there is mainly taking market share from OEMs, you won NORAD, it shows you guys have the capabilities to win sustainment. So can you talk about your confidence and being able to grow CMS over the next few years regardless of the top line DoD budget number? Thank you.\nSteve Demetriou: Bob, let me start and you add on. Actually, when we look at the budget that's relatively flat overall on Department of Defence, the certain -- components of that budget, when you start to peel your onion, is actually there's several growth items that are aligned with most of our priority initiatives. You look at the DoD space budget its up 28%, $18 billion budget, which fits right into our whole space intelligence activities coming out of the whole KeyW acquisition. Cybersecurity is up 5%. The Hypersonics, which were a growing player with our missile defence work, a recent Air Force win, some work that we do for NASA around that area, a whole host of classified programs where the budgets are up. And then you even look at, you know, like PFAS where they added $180 million where we're in the mix there. So environmental, Department of Defense, across our CMS, we actually feel pretty positive from a budget standpoint, even when you look at the headline of a flat Department of Defense budget.\nBob Pragada: Joe, the other part of that question is around and the strategy around gaining that market share really then comes from technology hubs that we have within the overall company and differentiating our position around what would traditionally been a people and seats kind of business around sustainment. So a technology enabled solution in order to take that market share.\nJoseph DeNardi: Kevin, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that transitioning to higher margin work at CMS will represent revenue headwind near term. What's the message there? I mean, how material is that? When does the headwind kind of end? And is there maybe a specific portion of CMS that you kind of want to let run off? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: So yes, there is a few contracts that we've had, which are going to be running off over the course of the first part of 2021 specifically, doesn't mean that we're not going to be able to show some growth. And especially I would focus the commentary more on bottom line as opposed to top line relative to that dynamic, Joe. So I think that the margin profile that we've been talking about, we do believe we're going to start to see some fundamental benefits of that in a more material manner as we enter into 2021. And so while the revenue could face some flattish kind of pressure over the short term, I think ultimately we're going to be in a position where as these new kind of projects and programs come into play with the associated ramp up in revenue and margin associated with those, you'll start to see that really play out in a nice way as we progress through 2021.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of [Jim] Cook from Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: I guess a couple of questions. One, you know, at your Analyst Day in 2019, I think you talked about sort of $7 to $8 earnings power potential for the company, understanding that\u2019s not in the cards for 2021. Can you just give us sort of your updated view on, is there a bridge to get there past 2021 and what would have to happen for you guys to get there? And then I guess my second question, obviously, the cash flow in the quarter was positive. Kevin, can you just help us understand where you think DSOs can go sort of over the next sort of 12 to 18 months and you know, just how you're thinking about cash flow opportunities, to improve cash flow conversion more consistently? Thank you.\nSteve Demetriou: I'll take the first one Kevin and then why don\u2019t you build on it. So Jamie, with regard to the 2019 strategy, I really think the best answer is the fundamentals of that strategy are solid. And if anything have been strengthened as we continue to diversify the company and bring innovative solutions. And it's just as you suggested, it's just moved to the right. And obviously, funding is going to play a key component on some elements of it but we're very confident, that's again just a matter of timing and that we're going to see the growth. But when you look at our critical mission solutions business and our people and places solutions, I just look at the 2019 strategy that led to that $7 to $8 outlook and feel very confident that that's still out there for us in the near-term. And as we progress and to given some guidance for '21 and I'm sure we\u2019ll also kind of give some update overall on the timing of that question. Kevin?\nKevin Berryman: So let me add some comments to Steve\u2019s comments. Just reminding Jamie and I think you're already sensitized to as the $7 to $8 was a potential earnings potential, which assumed that we would fully utilize the strength of our balance sheet in some manner, shape or form. And I think that clearly, as I just communicated, the strength of the balance sheet is as robust as it ever has been and consequently, those opportunities to utilize capital longer term are to fundamentally increase our growth potential is certainly there. So I would just make that comment. And that it's going to be conditioned upon the utilization of the balance sheet. I think clearly COVID is, has required us to step back and reflect and make sure we're taking care of business and we'll continue to do that. But I think that clearly longer term no change, I would say versus our ability to get to those kind of figures over the period of time that we will be talking about as we think about over the next year or two, or thereabout. The other point I would say on the DSOs, look COVID is putting some challenges in place for us as it relates to the DSOs. So if you go and you think about where we progressed or not over the course of 2021, we have had some challenges in the 2020 periods. And I think that we're just going to have to continue to focus on that get back to it. Certainly, there could be some pockets of disruption in areas where it would be tough to get back at those until there is greater visibility in terms of some of the underlying sectors of which we're supporting but we do believe we have that ability. And so couple of three days adds up to some pretty significant figures in terms of our improvements in cash flow. And we would expect that as we get through COVID, I'm not going to say exactly when that will be and when our customers are back kind of without being impacted by some of the dynamics, certainly, we feel like we're going to be able to get those numbers down by those levels and then some longer term to help us get to the conversion numbers that we would like.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from Benchmark.\nJosh Sullivan: On the defense contracting environment, you mentioned you've adjusted your G&A. How has the defense customer responded to that? Are they accepting COVID pass-throughs? And then also curious if there\u2019s increased costs plus additional remote working, has had any impact on the government's perspective on low cost, technically acceptable bids versus the more value added technology enabled approaches you guys are starting to put forward?\nBob Pragada: So I think that -- I\u2019ll answer the second part first, Josh, is that we do see that the value added in the differentiated solution is being accepted by our government client. As a differentiated solution, the natural if you look at what happened during the last dislocation or the global financial crisis, there was a trend more towards acceptable low bid. We haven't seen that yet. So I think that kind of plays to where we sit in the value trajectory. First part on some of the, when I say stimulus, some of the continuing efforts to keep our people going on critical efforts. I think that's a testament again to our portfolio. If you look at each sector that we're serving, it's not everybody that in the defense contracting community received the CARES 3610 type of compensation. We did, just because of how critical our services are with our government client. So we like our positioning of where we sit in the defense focused areas right now.\nJosh Sullivan: And then you guys have a very unique perspective of the global infrastructure environment. Just curious if you could just give us a sense of what the typical cost of designing in and securing against COVID is for the customer versus maybe that same project was without COVID productions a year ago?\nBob Pragada: So Josh, I'd say that with our clients, we don't go after a lot of newer clients. So if you look at the major public agencies that we do work for, whether it\u2019d be in the U.S. on state DOTs or big water agencies, UK, Australia, these are clients that we\u2019d have larger framework agreements with pre-established commercial arrangements. And so going back to Michael Dudas' first question what we've seen is is a use of that platform, that framework agreements that were already in place so any type of pricing pressures we haven't seen as far as the clients having to spend more dollars in order to get that work done. I think those vehicles are helping the client as well, because that cost of procurement that we talk about it from a supply chain standpoint having those agreements in place has helped the clients as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So we talk a lot about the interruption from physical distancing, but maybe not as much about the positive impacts that the pandemic could have on Jacobs. We talked about life science potential but could you talk about how your customers are reacting to the potential for re-shoring and bolstering supply chains in general and how Jacobs could be involved there? And then how work from home could potentially lower longer term costs for Jacobs in terms of mainly the potential to lower physical real estate costs as you go into FY21?\nSteve Demetriou: As far as the pandemic and the impact on our business, it's pretty widespread and there's a lot of opportunities there. Bob talked a lot about the life sciences side. When you look at the whole future of work, and I'll come back to the sort of the Jacobs opportunity. But the demand opportunity now that's out there for, we would say, we're in the whole supply chain of the digitization, massive change in the economy around digitization is, our industry leading position around semiconductor work, our mission critical data centers better accelerating and the whole race for 5G, all three of those areas we\u2019re a critical player in. And we\u2019ve clearly seen the fact with more virtual work, more streaming and online gaming, et cetera, that whole drive is going to increase the need for semiconductor capacity, data center capacity and 5G is another big example around a whole advanced facilities business. As it relates to Jacobs, we've commented that we had been working on a future of work strategy over the next several years prior to COVID-19. Our ability to rapidly shift to 85 plus percent of our employees and maintain strong productivity and be able to demonstrate that we not only can deliver projects but win business in that area is accelerating now, our work around, looking at what we can do, starting as early as 2021. And so we have a team looking at that. That's where we commented we'll be updating over the next several quarters of what that looks like, what the timing is, but we're very excited about next phase in our transformation journey around accelerating future work.\nKevin Berryman: I was just going to say we were planning to give an update on those efforts as we close out the fiscal 2020 year, and what the potential implications would be for 2021.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And there's an obvious follow-up there just in terms of revenue visibility. I know Michael asked the question. Let me ask it in a different way. As you sit here today, you mentioned pro forma backlog growth is up 4%. You have say strong book-to-bill in both segments. There's some question of whether PPS needs help from stimulus or new infrastructure bill, but you've got there's advanced facility stuff that we just talked about. So can you talk about your confidence in revenue growth in \u201821? Obviously, you've seen confident EBITDA and EPS growth. But in revenue growth in both segments?\nKevin Berryman: I think our belief is that absent in any substantive stimulus that comes into play, and this is not the only the U.S. but there are other regions around the globe in the UK and Australia specifically where we would be watching those areas closely. Look, I think we have a portfolio that's stable and has the ability to continue to build capabilities and deliver solutions to our clients. I think that as we think about that dynamic, we could see some growth in 2021 absent. But I think ultimately our belief is that stimulation there will be something as it relates to that and that probably results in the back half of 2021 being that much more stronger than the beginning parts of it. But I think that clearly the resiliency of our portfolio was we would suggest that we have the ability to grow in 2021.\nBob Pragada: Andy, if I could just add one more to your, the re-shoring comment, because it's an important one ad it goes to what Kevin and Steve are saying. I'd look at it from this dynamic. All of our larger, and those are we call them core, clients we've been with for decades. They're going through, clearly, there's a headline news on re-shoring. But think about it from a two step process. All of these clients are also looking at their product portfolio mix and then looking at the re-shoring aspect of that supply chain from the learnings of now countries being blocked during the pandemic. And so I would kind of characterize that as early innings. But with probably some optimism that that's going to be real as these two parallel efforts are going on at the same time.\nOperator: And your next question is from Gautam Khanna from Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Just wanted to follow up on some of the earlier questions, specifically thinking about revenue growth next year at CMS, you called out the transition on the one contract. Maybe if you could just quantify what the known headwinds are into next year and then if you could also maybe calibrate just on recompetes, you know, what percentage of sales are up for recompete in \u201821 or between now and the end of \u201821 and you know, what percentage of revenues therefore are vulnerable in \u201821 to recompetes? Thank you.\nSteve Demetriou: Let me start Keven and then maybe you can give whatever guides you want on the quantification of revenue. But \u201821 is going to be a fairly light year to almost down to one or two recompete. So it's a very immaterial effect for us in 2021. And so from a revenue standpoint, we don't see risk around that. In fact, we're excited about some initiatives that others are looking at the recompetes that we're hopefully going to gain some share on. But Kevin, do you want to talk about the revenue question?\nKevin Berryman: There's basically two things that are out there. We've had very large procurement revenue in 2020, which has actually dampened our margin profile. We've talked about that over the course of this fiscal year that will be transitioning off the books over the course of the first part of, the first half of 2021. And then of course depending upon how Hanford plays out, the Hanford Plateau project, obviously, will be off the books over the course of 2021, that assumes that the current protest dynamic doesn't change any material direction there. So those are numbers that will be plus $500 million certainly over the course of the full year, and we'll see how that plays out. But I think what I would suggest to you is the strength of the pipeline in our minds overcomes that number and ultimately starts to drive incremental profitability, because the procurement in Hanford Plateau are obviously lower parts of our margin profile. So that goes away, pipeline comes in and replaces it and margin goes up all at the same time, resulting in good operating profit growth.\nGautam Khanna: And I was hoping maybe you can actually quantify the higher procurement sort of pass through stuff this year, how much is sort of non-recurring. And then relatedly bookings in the September quarter, obviously, off to a good start. Maybe can you give us a sense for what just based on when the adjudications lie, how the bookings outlook at CMS looks the next September, December quarters, kind of what you're expecting as potentials in terms of book-to-bill?\nSteve Demetriou: Kevin maybe I\u2019ll start. Just building on Kevin\u2019s pipeline comment and what Bob talked about earlier on protests. So, we're getting off to a fast start, first and foremost, because some things we want in the third quarter are not on the books yet as it relates to our book-to-bill and our bookings and backlog. And so that, when you look at, first of all, when you look at those two initiatives but maybe Kings Bay and the NORAD wins, you put that into with everything else we won in the third quarter and the book-to-bill was strong in critical mission solutions. Our pipeline is at a record high, significant increase from where it was a year ago when we look at our current CMS pipeline of $30 billion. And when you look at the margin in that pipeline, it's exciting. And the things we've just recently announced are all margin enhancement, along of course with the Wood acquisition and KeyW acquisition as those continue to ramp up. So, as Kevin said that you put all that together, this is for us, a great transition that we're going through that's consistent with our strategy that we outlined of growing the business but enhancing the margins at the same time. And we feel confident that that's playing out now as we get into 2021 and beyond. And so, Kevin or Bob, anything to add to that?\nKevin Berryman: No, I think Steve, I think the first quarter will look solid. And as far as that hovering at one or above is very much within reach, we've got a nice pipeline.\nOperator: And your next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS.\nSteven Fisher: So you talked a few months ago about EBITDA growing in 2021, and you've reiterated it here today. I'm just curious how the drivers of that growth changed in the last few months or so, to what extent maybe is it more margin driven now rather than revenue, inorganic versus organic, or any particular program that maybe driving it now that were different than you were thinking a few months ago?\nSteve Demetriou: Well, let me just qualitatively say that some things that sort of help us make that comment about growth next year are most two recent acquisitions we made, KeyW and Wood, are clearly going to contribute to some of that growth next year. We've been doing very well on the KeyW acquisition around the cyber side and the mission IT side. As we've talked about this great opportunity we have on space intelligence has moved to the right a bit where it underperformed this year, but everything is still standing there with regard to the great opportunity. And we have two specific initiatives that we're moving through and we expect to drive growth next year around that whole space intelligence side of KeyW, along with the other two businesses. So we're very positive about that business. Wood Nuclear, combination with Jacobs, we're going to see the majority of the synergies next year around the cost synergies, as well as some revenue synergies. So those two businesses are going to contribute. We're going to have kind of some balancing things going on on the cost side as we resume some discretionary spending that we temporarily halted but at the same time, we have some initiatives underway where we're going to see some productivity and efficiency coming in with some of the things that we've initially talked about with future of work, et cetera. And then the rest of it is really driven by just a continuation of what we've talked about of being aligned to the secular trends that are moving in the right direction, national security, water infrastructure, water still is -- we're very bullish on, environmental resiliency, of course the whole healthcare and life sciences. We've been talking a lot about the intelligent asset management side on critical mission solutions that the three Navy wins over the last 12 to 18 months margin enhancement profit growth, and then, of course, this whole race to the Artemis 2024 space exploration side of things and add on top of that, the digital initiatives that we're working across both businesses but really the drivers of what we're talking about.\nSteven Fisher: And then maybe Kevin, I\u2019m curious what's the shape of how that 4% decline in pro forma revenues trends over the next handful of quarters. Should we assume that that remains negative through the fiscal first quarter of next year and then it starts to turn positive, or is that more like a second half of '21? Any thoughts on kind of the shape of that recovery.\nKevin Berryman: Probably not going to give you specifics relative to it, but I do think certainly we're facing a more muted short-term dynamic versus longer term consistent with the comments that we've made. So probably not going to give you a lot of incremental color but certainly, we're going to be more muted in the short-term. Certainly, I would say as it relates to the Q4 numbers, certainly we're going to be thinking about that relative to the numbers. And so maybe I'll leave it there and then we'll play out and give you more perspectives as we enter into 2021 after we finish up Q4 and have another three months under our belt relative to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Michael Feniger from Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: I know you said you expect some federal support on the PPS side. But before we get to November elections, there's a Fast Act expiring at the end of September. The recent Republican stimulus proposal really lacked aid for the state and local municipalities. So I'm just curious what is kind of the base assumption here? Can you guys grow, if there is a CR one year extension maybe and they just kind of punt to November? Maybe you could just flesh out your exposure by states and what you're seeing there. Are some states showing more than others, are they accessing rainy day funds? Clarity on that will be helpful.\nBob Pragada: The short answer, Michael, is that we're going to be solid. As far as tangible anticipated growth pre-pandemic, clearly, we're kind of in the new norm now. But when I say solid and when I'm saying solid, I'm talking about Michael in the event that there isn't agreement and we're moving towards an election. And it goes back to my earlier comment around the strength of our backlog and programs that have already, not only been approved but also funded and are a part of current state budgets that we don't see any reallocation going on there. So that's in the event. Now, the Fast Act line item, though, you mentioned it\u2019s not in the Republican proposal, it is in the democratic, as well as it could be a negotiating tool as well. So I think it's too early to make an assessment on that. As far as areas that give us that confidence. If you look at what kind of our main centers of really strong presence, these are household names that do have surpluses as it pertains to certain, I\u2019m speaking mostly on the transportation side even with revenues coming down from a user fees perspective, California, Texas, Southeast United States. And so those programs that were in our backlog and continue to be awarded, we're seeing very close to our clients and those are going to continue. How fast and how much they grow, we're still in the middle of that right now.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call over to your CEO for closing remarks.\nSteve Demetriou: All right. So thanks, everyone. Look, the past five months as the pandemic increased in intensity, we kept our focus on our people. The culture of caring that we've talked about is part of our D&A. Today's launch of our action plan for advancing justice and equality is our next phase, it\u2019s our call to action and direct response to the recent social and racial injustices and actions that go beyond words of rhetoric and actions we hope others will do the same. As we look at our business, these last two quarters have proven the resiliency of our company to stay the course, drive results in times of uncertainty, the diversity of our end markets, the strong foundation, the strong global teams, have all held firm. And looking forward, the highly recurring nature of our work provides us some good visibility into our business opportunities and we expect to grow EBITDA in 2021. Thank you and good luck.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. I'll discuss a more detailed summary now of our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on slide nine. Third quarter gross revenue increased 3% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue down 4%. PPS net revenue was flat year-over-year and CMS declined 9% on a pro forma basis. As Bob noted in his comments, the CMS decline was mainly attributed to physical distancing restrictions experienced to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.5%, down 35 basis points year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, the gross margin continues to face a headwind due to the flow-through effect on the reimbursable rate of our more efficient cost structure in PPS -- P&PS, positively offset by gross margin improvements in our CMS business. The lower reimbursement rate for fixed costs is more than offset by the underlying lower level of G&A costs, thus representing positive operating profit and margin impacts. This is reflected in lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 40 basis points year-over-year to 14.6%. During the current quarter, our G&A also benefited from lower travel and employee-related costs associated with actions taken to offset the short-term financial headwinds from COVID-19. Now that we have increased visibility into the dynamics of operating in the COVID-19 environment, we are adjusting our operating model accordingly and expect G&A as a percentage of revenue to increase modestly in the fourth quarter. GAAP operating profits improved substantially versus last year, driven by lower integration and divestiture-related costs, up 116% to $194 million and included $20 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, and $24 million of other charges consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, and $1 million of costs associated with Worley transition services agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $239 million, up 3% from the prior year figure. Our adjusted operating profits in net revenue was 8.9%, up 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by higher CMS and PPS margins, effectively offset by higher unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers of these costs on the next slide. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $227 million and $1.73 per share, and included a $0.71 net benefit, largely driven by the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake, and $0.11 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges as noted above, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was a $1.26 including a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year-ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was essentially flat year-over-year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $254 million or 9.5% of net revenue was down 2% year-over-year compared to the 3% increase in adjusted operating process, which was primarily due to a headwind from other income due to FX and non-controlling interest. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 for Q3, driven by the strong P&PS book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 times. CMS was -- book-to-bill was just under 1 times and reflected the burn off from Hanford Plateau. Importantly, the CMS Q3 backlog does not include our new awards at Navy Kings Bay and NORAD. The pipeline dynamics within CMS remain stable with no unusual delays or project cancellations. Within P&PS, the overall sales pipeline supports our top-line growth objectives, but we are seeing changes in the underlying composition of opportunities and timing on larger awards, which is reflected in our financial outlook. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to slide 10. Starting with CMS, pro forma revenue declined 8.6% year-over-year during the third quarter. CMS operating profits was $90 million and was up 17% year-over-year, but flat on a pro forma basis and well above our original expectation due to the COVID-19 dynamic. CMS operating profit margin was up 80 basis points year-over-year to 7.4%, overcoming the impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The upside versus our previous expectations were driven by a faster-than-expected transition to a virtual work environment and a return to COVID compliant onsite work environments. In line with our expectation, we also saw meaningful year-over-year decrease in lower margin procurement revenue, causing a top line headwind and an immaterial impact on OP dollar growth, given the lower margin associated with procurement related activities, resulting in a positive impact on OP margins. Also contributing to our OP growth was a milestone-based incentive fee that was achieved during the quarter. Please note, we are still experiencing material physical distancing limitation within our nuclear remediation efforts and for some secured work environments, as onsite access continues to be less than optimal, but we expect these operations to gradually improve utilization early into fiscal 2021. Also, in line with our CMS strategy of moving up the value stack, we expect margins to continue to improve over time as we pursue higher value opportunities. As we transition our CMS portfolio away from lower value services, such as procurement, we expect some short-term headwinds to revenue growth and a positive margin impact. Long-term, we continue to expect performance in line with our strategic long-term targets. Moving to people and places. Q3 net revenue was slightly down year-over-year. Let me provide more insight into the impacts associated with COVID-19. We and our clients swiftly moved to virtual work environments and our clients kept current projects continuing at historical burn rates. We saw continued strong underlying performance in the Americas even in the face of COVID. Net revenue increased double digits. Our advanced facilities customers initially slowed the pace of some projects as they digested the macro environment. However, they quickly shifted their CapEx plans to support potential COVID vaccines and therapies in addition to their current product mix. We continue to see headwinds in our UK business even after removing the physical distancing impact from COVID. That region's net revenue declined double-digits. While we are optimistic that the UK will begin to recover later in fiscal 2021, we remain cautious on the timing of that improvement. Operating profit was up 4%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 13% for the quarter, up over 50 basis points, both year-over-year and from Q2. Our P&PS margin was supported by adjusting our cost structure, by reducing discretionary spending, including travel and also benefited from lower employee related costs. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $41 million for quarter, up slightly from the Q2 figures and up from $27 million in the year ago period. A few discrete items contributed to the slightly higher costs, including some higher than normal legal and IT costs. We continue to target $35 million as the run rate outlook for unallocated corporate costs. Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a total reported net revenue to be up slightly year-over-year, which result in adjusted EBITDA up sequentially. This includes resuming some discretionary spend to position us for year-over-year growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Now, turning to Slide 11, I would like to update you on our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Regarding the sale of ECR, to-date, we have now incurred slightly over $250 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction separation and restructuring costs. We expect the remaining costs to be incurred over the remainder of the year. Turning to our acquisition of Woods Nuclear business, as a reminder, the transaction closed on March 6th. Integration continues to progress and we are on track to achieve our targeted $12 million run rate cost savings. Finally, we expect approximately $35 million of total charges in Q4 fiscal 2020 related to the ECR separation, wood cost to achieve synergies and other nonrecurring impacts, which is in line with the approximate $150 million in P&L costs that we have projected and expected over the course of this year. Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the quarter, we generated $332 million in free cash flow. Q3 cash flow was impacted by a net positive $25 million due to benefits from cash taxes, partly offset by headwinds from cash outflow associated with restructuring and other items. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect approximately $130 million of net nonrecurring outflows. Including these impacts, we continue to expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of fiscal 2020 with total reported free cash flow to now approach $400 million for the full year. As anticipated, DSOs were up from Q2 2020 and up year-over-year, as we expected some disruption from COVID-19. We still see ample opportunities to lower our DSO run rate, which will be a major driver for us attaining a one times free cash flow conversion target longer term. And now moving to the balance sheet. As the financial market stabilized over our fiscal third quarter, we repaid approximately $950 million on our revolving credit facility. We still ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.2 billion, resulting in $1.1 billion of net debt before attributing any benefits of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted EBIT 2020 EDA is just under 1 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regarding capital deployment, as we outlined last quarter, we paused our share purchases as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Our business proved out its expected resiliency and cash generation capabilities. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buyback activity going forward. For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of $132 million for the fourth quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2021, excluding additional share buybacks. Regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 in line with our longer term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased earlier this year and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus year ago. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on Slide 13. So yes, there is a few contracts that we've had, which are going to be running off over the course of the first part of 2021 specifically, doesn't mean that we're not going to be able to show some growth. And especially I would focus the commentary more on bottom line as opposed to top line relative to that dynamic, Joe. So I think that the margin profile that we've been talking about, we do believe we're going to start to see some fundamental benefits of that in a more material manner as we enter into 2021. And so while the revenue could face some flattish kind of pressure over the short term, I think ultimately we're going to be in a position where as these new kind of projects and programs come into play with the associated ramp up in revenue and margin associated with those, you'll start to see that really play out in a nice way as we progress through 2021. So let me add some comments to Steve's comments. Just reminding Jamie and I think you're already sensitized to as the $7 to $8 was a potential earnings potential, which assumed that we would fully utilize the strength of our balance sheet in some manner, shape or form. And I think that clearly, as I just communicated, the strength of the balance sheet is as robust as it ever has been and consequently, those opportunities to utilize capital longer term are to fundamentally increase our growth potential is certainly there. So I would just make that comment. And that it's going to be conditioned upon the utilization of the balance sheet. I think clearly COVID is, has required us to step back and reflect and make sure we're taking care of business and we'll continue to do that. But I think that clearly longer term no change, I would say versus our ability to get to those kind of figures over the period of time that we will be talking about as we think about over the next year or two, or thereabout. The other point I would say on the DSOs, look COVID is putting some challenges in place for us as it relates to the DSOs. So if you go and you think about where we progressed or not over the course of 2021, we have had some challenges in the 2020 periods. And I think that we're just going to have to continue to focus on that get back to it. Certainly, there could be some pockets of disruption in areas where it would be tough to get back at those until there is greater visibility in terms of some of the underlying sectors of which we're supporting but we do believe we have that ability. And so couple of three days adds up to some pretty significant figures in terms of our improvements in cash flow. And we would expect that as we get through COVID, I'm not going to say exactly when that will be and when our customers are back kind of without being impacted by some of the dynamics, certainly, we feel like we're going to be able to get those numbers down by those levels and then some longer term to help us get to the conversion numbers that we would like. I was just going to say we were planning to give an update on those efforts as we close out the fiscal 2020 year, and what the potential implications would be for 2021. I think our belief is that absent in any substantive stimulus that comes into play, and this is not the only the U.S. but there are other regions around the globe in the UK and Australia specifically where we would be watching those areas closely. Look, I think we have a portfolio that's stable and has the ability to continue to build capabilities and deliver solutions to our clients. I think that as we think about that dynamic, we could see some growth in 2021 absent. But I think ultimately our belief is that stimulation there will be something as it relates to that and that probably results in the back half of 2021 being that much more stronger than the beginning parts of it. But I think that clearly the resiliency of our portfolio was we would suggest that we have the ability to grow in 2021. There's basically two things that are out there. We've had very large procurement revenue in 2020, which has actually dampened our margin profile. We've talked about that over the course of this fiscal year that will be transitioning off the books over the course of the first part of, the first half of 2021. And then of course depending upon how Hanford plays out, the Hanford Plateau project, obviously, will be off the books over the course of 2021, that assumes that the current protest dynamic doesn't change any material direction there. So those are numbers that will be plus $500 million certainly over the course of the full year, and we'll see how that plays out. But I think what I would suggest to you is the strength of the pipeline in our minds overcomes that number and ultimately starts to drive incremental profitability, because the procurement in Hanford Plateau are obviously lower parts of our margin profile. So that goes away, pipeline comes in and replaces it and margin goes up all at the same time, resulting in good operating profit growth. No, I think Steve, I think the first quarter will look solid. And as far as that hovering at one or above is very much within reach, we've got a nice pipeline. Probably not going to give you specifics relative to it, but I do think certainly we're facing a more muted short-term dynamic versus longer term consistent with the comments that we've made. So probably not going to give you a lot of incremental color but certainly, we're going to be more muted in the short-term. Certainly, I would say as it relates to the Q4 numbers, certainly we're going to be thinking about that relative to the numbers. And so maybe I'll leave it there and then we'll play out and give you more perspectives as we enter into 2021 after we finish up Q4 and have another three months under our belt relative to the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the third quarter, our CMS business performed better than the COVID outlook we provided in the second quarter. Our solid third quarter results demonstrate CMS's resiliency and agility to work and perform at the highest levels for our clients. Though we will continue to be in COVID impacted environment through early fiscal 2021, our performance has been encouraging. The ability to recover from the shutdown despite physical distancing occurred faster than originally anticipated as our workforce and clients have addressed challenges and continue to execute on our contracts, regardless of work location. The underlying structural demand for our services remained strong. And as a result, total CMS backlog is now at $9.1 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. While a portion of our CMS portfolio can be performed remotely, we did see some impact in our long-term enterprise contracts that involve highly technical work on client sites. Some elements of these stable and resilient contracts did experience temporary impacts from physical distancing protocols. Let me share with you some details on the impact along with some notable wins by sector. Our U.S. federal civilian business makes up about 35% of CMS's revenue, with the majority of the revenue coming from our NASA and DOE clients. As we've shared with you in the past, Jacobs provides broad support to NASA in its accelerated work to meet the current administration's mandate to return to the moon in 2024. NASA must make progress towards these national goals, despite the challenges of working remotely and the reduced on-site workforce. At the end of our second quarter, we anticipated a low overall impact at NASA in the second half of fiscal year \u201820. Through the third quarter, that has been the actual case, as most of our workers have transitioned well to working remotely or operating within on-site physical distancing guidelines. Our NASA portfolio is expected to return to full capacity as we approach the end of our fiscal year. As NASA's largest provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of NASA's Artemis program -- excuse me, largest services provider of many aspects of NASA's Artemis program to extend the frontiers of human deep space exploration, sending humans to the moon by 2024, then to Mars and beyond. I would like to highlight a couple of achievements. A major milestone was reached in June when the solid rocket boosters arrived at the Kennedy Space Center to power NASA's Space Launch System. The Jacobs team handles final checkout and integration of all flight hardware for Artemis mission and is currently working on the integration of this hardware. Jacobs NASA team was also recently featured in wired magazine for utilizing artificial intelligence and generative design algorithms to build components for NASA's next generation spacesuit, the first major update in decades. Moving on to our nuclear portfolio. Last quarter, we'd anticipated this business would be moderately impacted by physical distancing constraints, resulting in a decrease in on-site workforce. Despite these headwinds, through the achievement of a few key performance milestones, several contract extension and overall business efficiencies, the nuclear portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter. Now, moving on to the U.S. Intelligence Community, which contributes just over 20% of CMS's revenue. Our Mission IT, C5ISR and Cyber businesses provide solutions to the sector. Last quarter, we had anticipated a moderate impact in Q3 from physical distancing headwinds at secured sites that would require split shifts. Based on actual results in Q3, we are now back at approximately 80% of normal operating levels and we expect all sites to be back to approximately 90% by the end of the fiscal year. In line with our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, it is important to note that we are transitioning off a lower margin classified procurement contract, which will impact short-term revenue growth during our fourth quarter, but has little impact to operating profit. As a result, our unit margins will benefit. Kevin will provide further details in his remarks. Our Mission IT business was awarded two notable contracts during the quarter for both -- both for the Department of Justice. The first is a three-year contract to modernize mission critical applications; and the second will provide software and network dev op support for the clients next generation laboratory information system. Additionally, in our space ISR business, we progressed to the next phase of a highly classified space solution, further solidifying Jacobs' position as a disruptor in this high-growth, high-margin sector. Shifting to the U.S. Department of Defense sector, which makes up approximately 20% of CMS's revenue, we provide a wide range of mission critical services performed at government sites or in highly secure facilities. At the end of Q2, we had anticipated much of our work at the military test ranges and classified skiffs to be moderately impacted by physical distancing requirements, actual performance matched our expectations. However, these impacts were partially mitigated by our work at the missile defense agency and positive performance in our cyber portfolio. Overall, these sites are now executing at approximately 80% of normal operating levels, and we expect our DOD work to ramp up to approximately 95% as we approach the end of the calendar year. Jacobs' continues to win new large enterprise contracts and raise its profile across the Department of Defense. For the Air Force, Jacobs was awarded a $434 million six-year contract with the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, providing system support and integration. Additionally, for the Navy Kings Bay facility, we were awarded a contract to deliver our intelligent asset management solution. Neither award is included in our Q3 backlog, but we recently received news that NORAD cleared the pro test [ph] period and will be included in our Q4 backlog. We remain encouraged that our Kings Bay will also successfully clear pro test. Shifting now to our commercial business. This business makes up just under 10% of our CMS's revenue. In telecom, we provide solutions for the buildout of 5G networks, a business that was impacted more severely than anticipated in Q3, from access limitations at some sites. We expect this business to strengthen over the next couple of quarters and return to its strong long-term demand rates thereafter. For the automotive sector, we primarily design and operate aerodynamic wind tunnels and provide general technical services, engineering and testing of automotive engines. Anticipated delayed awards Q3 did occur as our auto clients reevaluate their CapEx portfolios and future demand requirements. We expect a slower return to normal levels later in fiscal year \u201821. Finally, our CMS international sector makes up 15% of CMS' revenue and includes nuclear lifecycle solutions, support for UK's Ministry of Defense on its continuous At Sea Deterrent program and air and land weapons program in the UK and Australia. Our actual Q3 impact was less than anticipated. Strong shift work execution and physical distancing practices resulted in better performance. We expect our international business to return to approximately 95% of its normalized run rate as we exit the fiscal year. In summary, our overall sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline of $30 billion with $9 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile. We continue to see strong structural demand for our CMS services, even as impacts resulting from COVID-19 continue. Given we are aligned to high-priority mission-critical areas of federal governments, we do not anticipate material impact to our outlook in the event there's a change in administration. Moving to our People & Places Solutions business on slide 8. Our P&PS business generated a strong quarter and backlog performance, up 4.3% over the same period last year and up 3.2% quarter-over-quarter with an increased gross profit and backlog across all geographies and sectors. Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.2 times. While our pipeline remains robust across all geographies, we remain sensitive to the timing of economic recovery and government stimulus funding. Our business is well-positioned to benefit from current stimulus funding bills under review in multiple geographies around the world. Last quarter, I spoke about the anticipated COVID-19 impact to our People & Places Solutions business from a geographic and industry sector standpoint, as well as how we have optimized our delivery admits the pandemic. I'm pleased to say that overall, we are performing better than the moderate impact scenario we expected with most of our existing projects continuing and minimal to moderate delays in new awards. The diversity and resilience of our business and the ability to draw upon market, global and digital conductivity to deliver lasting and relevant solutions to our customers has been the key differentiator for us. Beginning with our buildings and infrastructure geographies, the Americas, including federal and environmental services business continues to be one of our best-performing and most resilient geographies with minimal impacts from COVID-19 to-date. Our federal infrastructure and water sectors continue to outperform, and we are retaining some of the best talent in the industry, resulting in strong revenue growth year-over-year. Demonstrating the depth and breadth of our solutions offering we were awarded several major projects in the portfolio, spanning multiple end market. For example, we've been selected for the design of $130 million drinking water pipeline for the Great Lakes Water Authority in Detroit. In Texas, we were selected for the Interstate Highway 35 Mobility program which will improve conductivity for all forms of transit across 80 miles of I-35. And we were awarded a major follow-on contract with FEMA for continued hurricane recovery efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We anticipate continued steady performance. However, delays and stimulus funding could affect the timing of new awards in FY21. In our Europe and Middle East business, recent UK government funding authorizations for environmental and water programs, including a recent award with Anglian Water Services show promise amidst continued Brexit-related slowdowns. The Anglian Water strategic pipelines alliance will deliver a new connected infrastructure, leveraging technology such as digital twins to drive greater efficiency and reliability. In our Middle East business, we're observing prioritized investments in water and transportation infrastructure. We remain cautiously optimistic on expectations for recovery in both of these geographies later in fiscal year 2021. Our Asia Pacific business performed better than anticipated. In Australia, New Zealand, we experienced material growth in the quarter and are up year-on-year on both revenue and operating profit. We converted our pipeline into several major wins in cloud computing and healthcare and are leveraging our global delivery capabilities. Southeast Asia remains steady with some project-related delays due to the pandemic and we anticipate some volatility into fiscal year '21. Building on our higher value solution capability, we have been selected as program manager for the new Noida International Airport in Delhi, India. We will provide strategic planning, risk management, digital solutions and program management for this new Greenfield development. We're applying our global integrated delivery model to provide leading solutions from around the world to this exciting project. Last quarter, we indicated that our advanced facilities business worldwide would likely experience positive effects from responding to the global pandemic. The demand for therapeutics and vaccine facilities is increasing. And we have drawn upon our global leadership to lock in several key wins in the quarter with several more in the pipeline. These projects tend to be shorter duration, high intensity projects, allowing us to leverage innovative and integrated delivery technique to meet demand. As an example, we're working with AstraZeneca to retrofit an existing fill finish manufacturing facility to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the market, as soon as late calendar year 2020, subject to clinical test results. We're also seeing an uptick in demand for data centers and semiconductor manufacturing due to increased cloud computing requirements. We have continued optimism for these businesses. I will now discuss our core sectors. Global mobility restrictions are easing in several regions and we are seeing a slow recovery in all modes of transportation. Early government relief funding has sustained many critical infrastructure projects and we're seeing continued investment in rail, including a recent award with transport from New South Wales to transform the rail network for communities across the Greater Sydney area. Additional global government stimulus is expected to include transportation related funding aimed at driving economic recovery. Although timing, trajectory and other key details remain uncertain. While our current business remains stable, continuing resolution and stimulus funding will drive growth opportunities. The water market continues to be resilient with long-term demand in both, upgrades to water infrastructure and utility operations and maintenance. Additionally, we continue to see ongoing growth in digital solutions including smart metering, AI, data analytics, automation and remote operations. While market indicators suggest CapEx pressure in 2021 and recovery into 2022, as the pandemic abates and stimulus funding becomes available, we still expect to maintain growth momentum driven by solid performance with our clients and superior expertise that effectively leverages tech-enabled solutions. The environmental sector is expected to see flat to moderate growth in 2021, with demand continuing steadily from federal and private clients, as well as stimulus related to investment in green and blue infrastructure. In addition to DoD client focus on PFAS, some states have established grant programs to address PFAS remediation. Further, we believe a focus on climate change initiatives will drive opportunities globally. We are well-positioned for continued growth and to capitalize on these new opportunities through trusted relationships with long-term clients, our diversity of markets in which we can apply innovative environmental solutions and strong retention of our global pool of expertise. In the built environment, which includes government facilities, healthcare, higher education and smart cities. We are seeing demand for repurposing business space as the need for a distributed work environment, and smart and sustainable buildings continues, allowing us to leverage our digital solutions. Our global healthcare crisis response team is combining multidisciplinary expertise from across the world to provide dynamic, forward-thinking, advisory and resilient solutions to a broad range of clients responding to the pandemic, as well as to those healthcare clients adapting to new healthcare service delivery models. Summing up the quarter. The negative effects of the global pandemic on growth in our People & Places Solutions business were partially offset by solid engagements with our core clients, and ongoing cost control. We continue to be proactive and agile to shifting market trends, which has resulted in a solid type of pipeline, and allows us to continue to drive our global, market and digital connectivity strategy. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Michael, we're actually cautiously optimistic that something will be done. But in any scenario, the strength of our backlog right now is sustainable and resilient. So really when we talk about growth is really is the discussion around the dependence on stimulus. As far as a steady she goes, our backlog is represented back to date. So that kind of brings a little bit of the separation as being totally and solely dependent on those that are being discussed right now, become more of a topic later in the fiscal year, next year. And Michael, you've been with us for a long time, you know how well positioned we are there too. So, we see the short term book and burn component of that being a real positive for us. And we're seeing, I would call, we're in the early innings of what that could mean for the business, specifically our positioning with these clients that we've had for several decades. Joe, the other part of that question is around and the strategy around gaining that market share really then comes from technology hubs that we have within the overall company and differentiating our position around what would traditionally been a people and seats kind of business around sustainment. So a technology enabled solution in order to take that market share. So I think that -- I'll answer the second part first, Josh, is that we do see that the value added in the differentiated solution is being accepted by our government client. As a differentiated solution, the natural if you look at what happened during the last dislocation or the global financial crisis, there was a trend more towards acceptable low bid. We haven't seen that yet. So I think that kind of plays to where we sit in the value trajectory. First part on some of the, when I say stimulus, some of the continuing efforts to keep our people going on critical efforts. I think that's a testament again to our portfolio. If you look at each sector that we're serving, it's not everybody that in the defense contracting community received the CARES 3610 type of compensation. We did, just because of how critical our services are with our government client. So we like our positioning of where we sit in the defense focused areas right now. So Josh, I'd say that with our clients, we don't go after a lot of newer clients. So if you look at the major public agencies that we do work for, whether it'd be in the U.S. on state DOTs or big water agencies, UK, Australia, these are clients that we'd have larger framework agreements with pre-established commercial arrangements. And so going back to Michael Dudas' first question what we've seen is is a use of that platform, that framework agreements that were already in place so any type of pricing pressures we haven't seen as far as the clients having to spend more dollars in order to get that work done. I think those vehicles are helping the client as well, because that cost of procurement that we talk about it from a supply chain standpoint having those agreements in place has helped the clients as well. Andy, if I could just add one more to your, the re-shoring comment, because it's an important one ad it goes to what Kevin and Steve are saying. I'd look at it from this dynamic. All of our larger, and those are we call them core, clients we've been with for decades. They're going through, clearly, there's a headline news on re-shoring. But think about it from a two step process. All of these clients are also looking at their product portfolio mix and then looking at the re-shoring aspect of that supply chain from the learnings of now countries being blocked during the pandemic. And so I would kind of characterize that as early innings. But with probably some optimism that that's going to be real as these two parallel efforts are going on at the same time. The short answer, Michael, is that we're going to be solid. As far as tangible anticipated growth pre-pandemic, clearly, we're kind of in the new norm now. But when I say solid and when I'm saying solid, I'm talking about Michael in the event that there isn't agreement and we're moving towards an election. And it goes back to my earlier comment around the strength of our backlog and programs that have already, not only been approved but also funded and are a part of current state budgets that we don't see any reallocation going on there. So that's in the event. Now, the Fast Act line item, though, you mentioned it's not in the Republican proposal, it is in the democratic, as well as it could be a negotiating tool as well. So I think it's too early to make an assessment on that. As far as areas that give us that confidence. If you look at what kind of our main centers of really strong presence, these are household names that do have surpluses as it pertains to certain, I'm speaking mostly on the transportation side even with revenues coming down from a user fees perspective, California, Texas, Southeast United States. And so those programs that were in our backlog and continue to be awarded, we're seeing very close to our clients and those are going to continue. How fast and how much they grow, we're still in the middle of that right now."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jon. And thanks everyone for joining us today to discuss our third quarter business performance and strategy update. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to occupy our time, as leaders, we must not lose sight on speaking up for what's right. Earlier today, we launched Jacobs' Global Action Plan for advancing justice and equality, which was developed in a direct response to recent social and racial injustices. For the last several years, I've been pleased with Jacobs' industry-leading progress on building a high-performance culture, led by our focus on inclusion and diversity, which we call TogetherBeyond. We believe this has been a critical success factor in driving improved performance and shareholder returns. Today's launch of Jacobs' Advancing Justice and Equality Action Plan is our next phase of this journey and holds on are TogetherBeyond strategy with the four primary pillars centered around culture building and engagement; leadership, commitment and accountability; developing talent; and growing the business. This action plan is about achieving true equality for all our employees, current and future, with a priority now on ensuring black employees have unquestionable equal opportunity and the tools needed to advance and achieve their ultimate goals at Jacobs. I'm proud of the employee engagement in the development of this action plan, starting with the team, who collaborated alongside Jacobs' Board of Directors and our executive leadership team to outline transparent, specific and measurable actions. First commitment is amplifying a culture of belonging by expanding our existing Conscious Inclusion program through Bystander Intervention training with the commitment to training our 55,000-person global workforce by the end of fiscal year 2021. Engaging 3,000 Jacobs' leaders and meaningful dialogues on antiracism to expand their focus on justice and equality. Driving personal accountability of senior leadership for inclusion by tying individual inclusion and diversity performance plan to compensation. And adding Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a U.S. holiday, encouraging employees to engage in volunteer opportunities around equality of justice. Our second commitment is to recruit, retain and advance black employees based on merit by increasing the representation of black employees at all levels over the next three years to proportionally reflect the overall external population. To accomplish this, we are increasing our leadership development programs to accelerate advancement for black employees to all levels of leadership, requiring all senior leaders to sponsor and mentor at least one black employee and ensure global reach to these efforts, and further strengthening the diversity Jacobs' Board of Directors including black representation. This has been a success area for our Board over the last four years, but one that can be continually improved as Board members retire and as we appoint highly talented diverse contributors. Our third commitment is about driving structural change in the broader society. To meet this commitment, we'll donate $10 million over the next five years in support of black educational and professional development opportunities that include two specific areas. Supporting primary and secondary education programs, focused on science, technology, engineering, arts and math, to prepare black students for esteemed professions. And providing financial support for scholarship, mentoring and internship opportunities at Jacobs for black high school and college students. In addition to that investment, we're also promoting programs with organizations committed to justice and equality through collectively, Jacobs' giving and volunteering platform including leveraging our expertise in areas like water for at-risk urban and rural communities. And materially increasing the percentage of Jacobs spend over the next five years with women and minority owned suppliers and vendors. To drive this action plan and our global IND strategy, we have appointed Jeff Dingle as Vice President of TogetherBeyond. Advancing justice and equality requires strong leadership and a relentless drive to deliver on the vision. And Jeff is the right person to lead this important work and grow a culture where employees want to join, stay and thrive. Ultimately, we must create a culture in which every person can access a future of opportunities, contributing to a structural change that Jacobs and in the broader society is about doing our part as a global leader. The time is now for us to get this right, once and for all. Turning to slide 5 to discuss our continued focus on keeping our people safe during the pandemic and how we're supporting clients to solve COVID-19 challenges. As we approach five months of battling the coronavirus, we remain focused on keeping our people safe first and foremost, and delivering on our commitments to our clients. As the duration of the pandemic has extended, Jacobs' strong culture of caring and particularly our emphasis on employee wellbeing has really come to the forefront. Our teams have responded with new programs for engaging our people in supportive ways, including deep dive series on mental health resiliency. Situation continues to be fluid, and as a global company, the variability from location to location is dramatic. Our crisis management teams continue to monitor and respond to the pandemic in our local areas. And with regard to our efforts around a return to the workplace, we are demonstrating flexibility to fit the needs of our people and our clients, while accelerating our future of work strategy. Our efforts in supporting our clients and communities in fighting COVID-19 include on the treatment side, our world leading pharmaceutical solutions team playing a major role in the retrofit of facilities to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our teams are also supporting clients of public health response strategies in U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand. And from a solution standpoint, we're deploying our proprietary ION technology for contact tracing with pharmaceutical clients at large scale facilities. We're developing scenario modeling software being used by transit clients around the globe, and digital monitoring of waste streams for COVID-19 at municipal water treatment plants. Turning to slide 6. Our business, which at its core, solves highly technical scientific-based challenges across a variety of sectors, proved its resiliency in one of the most abrupt global disruptive shocks that we have experienced. Part of our resiliency is driven by an alignment to high-value sectors of the global economy, such as national security, water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, healthcare and life sciences, intelligent asset management, space exploration and the convergence of information and operational technology. In addition to deep technical expertise, we benefit from economies of scale in both our businesses. This provides us the ability to quickly adjust to global changes in demand and manage our cost structure. More importantly, our culture fosters strong business acumen and innovative thinking to adapt rapidly to shifts in demand. While we were certainly impacted by the pandemic during our third quarter, from a financial standpoint, we showed solid performance during the quarter with pro forma backlog up 4%. Adjusted operating profit was up 3% year-over-year as we quickly transitioned to the new virtual work environment with strong productivity, while carefully managing discretionary spending. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $332 million and now expect reported fiscal 2020 free cash flow to approach $400 million. Overall, we witnessed better than expected performance in the third quarter, given the ability to proactively work with our clients to overcome physical distancing requirements. Considering this third quarter performance and our initial view of our fourth quarter, we're raising our fiscal 2020 outlook. COVID-19 will continue to impact us in the fourth quarter, and likely provide challenges into early fiscal 2021. For the full fiscal 2021, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth with potential infrastructure stimulus providing upside relative to these expectations. Finally, we continue to maintain healthy financial flexibility with ample liquidity that can be prudently deployed toward high-return opportunities. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. All right. Thanks, Kevin. Now, let me review our total company outlook. Given our better than expected transition to a virtual work environment and the ramp up of on site operations, we're updating our fiscal 2020 outlook. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $1 billion to $1.50 billion from the $950 million to $1.50 billion. We are also updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.05 to $5.30, up from the $4.80 to $5.30 previous guidance. Importantly, at the midpoint of our revised EPS range, 2020 total fiscal year adjusted EPS represents year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from discrete tax items in both years. Let me also provide some insight to the COVID specific impact on this outlook. At the time of our second quarter earnings call, we communicated that we expected the gross impact to second half 2020 earnings would be approximate -- the net impact the second half fiscal 2020 earnings would be approximately $0.50 per share. However, as a result of our enhanced ability to adapt to physical distancing, we now expect a lower net impact from COVID of $0.35 per share. Given our success in adjusting our operations to a virtual work environment, we are further evaluating opportunities to significantly improve our efficiency through new structural changes to our future of work and look forward to sharing our strategy over the coming quarters. And looking into fiscal 2021, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth with the second half stronger than the first half performance. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, we'll now open the call. Bob, let me start and you add on. Actually, when we look at the budget that's relatively flat overall on Department of Defence, the certain -- components of that budget, when you start to peel your onion, is actually there's several growth items that are aligned with most of our priority initiatives. You look at the DoD space budget its up 28%, $18 billion budget, which fits right into our whole space intelligence activities coming out of the whole KeyW acquisition. Cybersecurity is up 5%. The Hypersonics, which were a growing player with our missile defence work, a recent Air Force win, some work that we do for NASA around that area, a whole host of classified programs where the budgets are up. And then you even look at, you know, like PFAS where they added $180 million where we're in the mix there. So environmental, Department of Defense, across our CMS, we actually feel pretty positive from a budget standpoint, even when you look at the headline of a flat Department of Defense budget. I'll take the first one Kevin and then why don't you build on it. So Jamie, with regard to the 2019 strategy, I really think the best answer is the fundamentals of that strategy are solid. And if anything have been strengthened as we continue to diversify the company and bring innovative solutions. And it's just as you suggested, it's just moved to the right. And obviously, funding is going to play a key component on some elements of it but we're very confident, that's again just a matter of timing and that we're going to see the growth. But when you look at our critical mission solutions business and our people and places solutions, I just look at the 2019 strategy that led to that $7 to $8 outlook and feel very confident that that's still out there for us in the near-term. And as we progress and to given some guidance for '21 and I'm sure we'll also kind of give some update overall on the timing of that question. Kevin? As far as the pandemic and the impact on our business, it's pretty widespread and there's a lot of opportunities there. Bob talked a lot about the life sciences side. When you look at the whole future of work, and I'll come back to the sort of the Jacobs opportunity. But the demand opportunity now that's out there for, we would say, we're in the whole supply chain of the digitization, massive change in the economy around digitization is, our industry leading position around semiconductor work, our mission critical data centers better accelerating and the whole race for 5G, all three of those areas we're a critical player in. And we've clearly seen the fact with more virtual work, more streaming and online gaming, et cetera, that whole drive is going to increase the need for semiconductor capacity, data center capacity and 5G is another big example around a whole advanced facilities business. As it relates to Jacobs, we've commented that we had been working on a future of work strategy over the next several years prior to COVID-19. Our ability to rapidly shift to 85 plus percent of our employees and maintain strong productivity and be able to demonstrate that we not only can deliver projects but win business in that area is accelerating now, our work around, looking at what we can do, starting as early as 2021. And so we have a team looking at that. That's where we commented we'll be updating over the next several quarters of what that looks like, what the timing is, but we're very excited about next phase in our transformation journey around accelerating future work. Let me start Keven and then maybe you can give whatever guides you want on the quantification of revenue. But \u201821 is going to be a fairly light year to almost down to one or two recompete. So it's a very immaterial effect for us in 2021. And so from a revenue standpoint, we don't see risk around that. In fact, we're excited about some initiatives that others are looking at the recompetes that we're hopefully going to gain some share on. But Kevin, do you want to talk about the revenue question? Kevin maybe I'll start. Just building on Kevin's pipeline comment and what Bob talked about earlier on protests. So, we're getting off to a fast start, first and foremost, because some things we want in the third quarter are not on the books yet as it relates to our book-to-bill and our bookings and backlog. And so that, when you look at, first of all, when you look at those two initiatives but maybe Kings Bay and the NORAD wins, you put that into with everything else we won in the third quarter and the book-to-bill was strong in critical mission solutions. Our pipeline is at a record high, significant increase from where it was a year ago when we look at our current CMS pipeline of $30 billion. And when you look at the margin in that pipeline, it's exciting. And the things we've just recently announced are all margin enhancement, along of course with the Wood acquisition and KeyW acquisition as those continue to ramp up. So, as Kevin said that you put all that together, this is for us, a great transition that we're going through that's consistent with our strategy that we outlined of growing the business but enhancing the margins at the same time. And we feel confident that that's playing out now as we get into 2021 and beyond. And so, Kevin or Bob, anything to add to that? Well, let me just qualitatively say that some things that sort of help us make that comment about growth next year are most two recent acquisitions we made, KeyW and Wood, are clearly going to contribute to some of that growth next year. We've been doing very well on the KeyW acquisition around the cyber side and the mission IT side. As we've talked about this great opportunity we have on space intelligence has moved to the right a bit where it underperformed this year, but everything is still standing there with regard to the great opportunity. And we have two specific initiatives that we're moving through and we expect to drive growth next year around that whole space intelligence side of KeyW, along with the other two businesses. So we're very positive about that business. Wood Nuclear, combination with Jacobs, we're going to see the majority of the synergies next year around the cost synergies, as well as some revenue synergies. So those two businesses are going to contribute. We're going to have kind of some balancing things going on on the cost side as we resume some discretionary spending that we temporarily halted but at the same time, we have some initiatives underway where we're going to see some productivity and efficiency coming in with some of the things that we've initially talked about with future of work, et cetera. And then the rest of it is really driven by just a continuation of what we've talked about of being aligned to the secular trends that are moving in the right direction, national security, water infrastructure, water still is -- we're very bullish on, environmental resiliency, of course the whole healthcare and life sciences. We've been talking a lot about the intelligent asset management side on critical mission solutions that the three Navy wins over the last 12 to 18 months margin enhancement profit growth, and then, of course, this whole race to the Artemis 2024 space exploration side of things and add on top of that, the digital initiatives that we're working across both businesses but really the drivers of what we're talking about. All right. So thanks, everyone. Look, the past five months as the pandemic increased in intensity, we kept our focus on our people. The culture of caring that we've talked about is part of our D&A. Today's launch of our action plan for advancing justice and equality is our next phase, it's our call to action and direct response to the recent social and racial injustices and actions that go beyond words of rhetoric and actions we hope others will do the same. As we look at our business, these last two quarters have proven the resiliency of our company to stay the course, drive results in times of uncertainty, the diversity of our end markets, the strong foundation, the strong global teams, have all held firm. And looking forward, the highly recurring nature of our work provides us some good visibility into our business opportunities and we expect to grow EBITDA in 2021. Thank you and good luck."

Please note that due to the timing of the Wood Nuclear acquisition in March, the current and prior period impacts of the Wood Nuclear business have been excluded when discussing pro forma comparisons.We believe this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods.Now turning to the agenda on slide 3. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Jacobs Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou, President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Pragada and President and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by discussing our climate action commitments, then provide a update on our response to COVID-19 pandemic and then recap of our financial results and updated outlook, Bob will then review our performance by line of business and Kevin will provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by an update on our acquisitions and ECR divestiture, as well as review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide detail on updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we\u2019ll open the call for your questions.With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteven Demetriou: All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our fiscal year second quarter results.Before I get started, I wanted to share our recent announcement on our launch of Jacobs\u2019 Climate Action Plan. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain focused on delivering on our strategy and advancing our purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world.We often say, we are a people business at Jacobs, which is why we must take actions that help sustain the world within which we all live. Jacobs\u2019 first Climate Action Plan sets us apart capturing the shared passion, pride and drive of our people, as we work to preserve the planet for future generations.The launch of this plan is another major milestone in our cultural and company transformation. Our collective focus on developing and delivering on our strategy, including a deliberate portfolio of transformation brings us to this important juncture. Together we are committing to 100% renewable energy and Net Zero Carbon by the end of 2020, with a long-term commitment to be carbon negative by 2030.Moving forward, we want to leverage our depth of expertise and leading position in the industry to work with our clients and our supply chain to drive climate resiliency into our solutions, investing together in projects that drive profitable reduction in carbon emissions. This is an exciting milestone in the company\u2019s history, and a course that we can take pride in delivering on together as we reinvent our tomorrow.Now turning to slide 5. Our new brand, Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow, has served as a strong galvanizing driver as we navigate through the COVID-19 environment. Throughout the past 8 weeks we have challenged the way in which we work and the markets we face and in the process, we are reinventing our tomorrow real-time through growth opportunities for our people and innovative offerings for our clients.From the outset of the pandemic, our focus has been the safety and well-being of our people, maintaining business continuity and delivering on our commitments to our clients.We mobilized a global, cross functional COVID-19 Critical Response Team led by our Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada to address both internal and external COVID-19 related challenges, with Regional Response Teams charged with rapid action on the ground.As soon as we learned that global travel was shown to be at the root of the continued spread of the virus and physical distancing was critical to flattening that curve, we took early, immediate and decisive action to restrict travel and to maximize remote working. Except for mission-critical employees, all of our people have been successfully working remotely over the last two months.Proactive, engaging and transparent employee communications has been critical. From the outset, I immediately started a regular cadence of communication with our employees globally. This included a daily executive leadership team meeting, a weekly global email message from me at the beginning of each week to all employees. And a live mid-week virtual Town Hall so that my executive leadership team and I can connect real-time with our teams around the globe.We also expanded our intranet, and equipped our leaders with tools to send short, personal video messages to their people. Over communication was and remains an imperative.As we shifted from office to home, we took our strong BeyondZero safety culture with us to create and maintain a safe working environment for our teams. As part of that, positive mental health is paramount, and we increased our offerings of mental health tools and techniques and mobilized our more than 1800 Jacobs Positive Mental Health Champions around the world.A certain portion of our business is essential and mission critical to governments and private sector clients where our staff continue to work on site. In these cases, we worked closely with our clients and established project-specific plans to ensure the safety of our people and the integrity of the operation.I have been so impressed with the success we have had in accelerating our digital transformation, investing in optimizing our networks and leveraging technology to facilitate collaboration and more flexible working scenarios for our people, while at the same time delivering on our commitments to our clients.Coming out of this pandemic we will have validated different work approaches, with less reliance on extensive travel and physical real estate, and with the potential for significantly reduced cost and carbon footprint. We are currently in the process of planning a safe return to our workplaces, how, when, and in some cases if, while at the same time advancing our strategy of our future of work. We will share more about this in our next earnings call.Early on during this pandemic, we leveraged our capabilities to become part of the COVID-19 solution. As our customers transitioned to remote working, we helped plan and execute those shifts, including support in assessment of cyber security implications.Materials and 3-D printing equipment were redeployed to help the frontline care workers with PPE. Existing federal and local government framework contracts around the globe were leveraged for action planning and implementation of healthcare facilities, including contracts for the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the Governments of U.K., Australia and New Zealand;Our Life Sciences teams were tapped for designing facilities that will ultimately produce COVID-19 vaccines or other therapies. And on the innovation side of the issue, we have two teams addressing different critical challenges. To better understand the spread of the Coronavirus, our teams are launching a pilot program to monitor wastewater streams using digital tools to help provide actionable COVID-19 insights and data to our clients.Our technologists are busy considering what it means for building owners when shelter in place orders are lifted and buildings that sat vacant for weeks or months may cause problems of their own such as legionella, lead contamination and poor air quality.Our teams have developed guidance for schools, offices and other public and private spaces to help them safely re-open and prepare for reentry. We believe that the positive impact on our culture over the past four years and our transparent and measured behaviors during this crisis has solidified loyalty with our employees, resulting in increased structural talent retention which will unlock more investment dollars for innovation and growth.As we turn to s6 to further discuss our business resiliency. As it relates to our people, we have purposely maintained our workforce capacity to position us strongly for a recovery after physical distancing subsides.By strategically aligning our portfolio to a diverse set of high value sectors such as; national security, water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, healthcare and life sciences, intelligent asset management, space exploration and the convergence of information and operational technology, we have significantly increased the durability and growth opportunities of our business under multiple economic scenarios and the expected new norm in the aftermath of COVID-19.In parallel with our portfolio transformation, we invested in digital technology to further expand our global integrated delivery model. This provides the ability to rapidly flex our deep technical expertise to accommodate any scenario around changes to global versus localized demand.Equally as important, we have created a powerful inclusive culture, which we believe unleashes the ability to execute more effectively versus our competitors when adjusting to changing market dynamics.From a financial standpoint this strategy has demonstrated strong results over the last few years and that track record of performance continued in our fiscal second quarter with pro forma backlog up 5% and pro forma net revenue up 7.5% year-over-year.Second quarter adjusted EBITDA also grew year-over-year and after a correction in the third quarter we expect it to improve in our fiscal fourth quarter. Equally as important and in-line with our previous outlook, we delivered positive free cash flow in the quarter and expect strong free cash flow for the remainder of the year.That the physical distancing constraints from COVID-19 have resulted in some near-term headwinds impacting the current third quarter as we and our customers adjust to a new working environment. However, we view these headwinds as temporary. As a result, we would expect the business to ramp up to run-rate levels over the next six-months as the structural drivers of our business are strong and our sales pipeline remains robust.We have proactively positioned our capacity to capitalize on this new normal environment by retaining talent and maintaining key investments. We believe these actions position Jacobs for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth in fiscal 2021.Finally, we have strong financial flexibility with ample liquidity that can be prudently deployed toward high return opportunities.Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued to perform well with total backlog now $9.1 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis.Growth was driven by sizeable new business wins with the Navy to deliver intelligent asset management, and with the Air Force for research and development of rocket and propulsion technology, as well as two smaller but strategic wins for cyber assessment solutions for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and a develop and operations contract with the FBI\u2019s electronic laboratory. Overall, Q2 performance was in-line with our expectations for the business.As a part of the overall financial scenario planning for the company, we believe the crisis will have a short-term impact on our CMS business, with 90% of the temporary decline we are currently experiencing due to the impact of physical distancing associated with COVID-19.The underlying structural demand for our services remains strong and as a result we expect business to ramp up as we approach the end of our fiscal year and expect continued growth in fiscal \u201821 and beyond.Our CMS business is supported by long term, enterprise contracts. Unlike other parts of our CMS portfolio which can be executed virtually, these contracts involve highly technical work, such as Department of Energy remediation and Department of Defense test ranges, where access to the client\u2019s site is required. Some elements of these stable and resilient contracts are experiencing temporary impacts from physical distancing protocols.Let me now share with you further details on the impact by sector. Our US Federal Civilian business makes up approximately 40% of CMS revenue, with a majority coming from our NASA and DOE clients.Jacobs provides broad support to NASA in its accelerated work to meet the current Administration\u2019s mandate to return to the moon in 2024. Our client must make progress toward these national goals despite the challenges of teleworking and a reduced on-site workforce. At NASA we expect a low overall impact in the second half of the year as most of our work transitioned to teleworking or operating within physical distancing guidelines.However, we anticipate our DOE and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited nuclear contracts to be impacted to a greater degree in the second half of the year, as Jacobs teams are operating under physical distancing constraints that significantly decrease the on-site workforce.While DOE has provided us the ability to recoup the direct cost from the idle work force, our operating profit is generated on a performance incentive milestone basis. As a result, we expect to recognize revenue from these customers at a lower profitability until we ramp back to normal operating levels, which is expected later this fiscal year.I want to note that this part of our business continues to win awards in this tough environment. In April we were awarded a 39-month extension of DOE\u2019s West Valley Demonstration Project. West Valley is just one of the five extensions we have recently been awarded for our ten project sites.In the event of a continuing economic slowdown our nuclear remediation will be one of the most resilient components of our portfolio given the well-funded long-term recurring nature of the business.Now moving to the US Intelligence Community which contributes just over 20% of CMS revenue. Our Mission IT, C5ISR, and Cyber businesses provide solutions to this sector. Our clients in the Intelligence Community must continue to provide these critical services, remaining resilient in the face of increased cyber-attacks, and preserve continuity of operations, while responding to the sudden need to reduce on-site workforces.Overall, we see a moderate impact from physical distancing headwinds at sites that require split shifts in secured facilities. We expect the impact to dissipate as we approach the end of the fiscal year. This is partially offset by continued strong performance in our Cyber and Mission-IT business.Moving on, the US Department of Defense makes up approximately 20% of CMS revenue where we provide a wide range of mission critical services performed at government sites or in highly secure facilities. Our work at the Missile Defense Agency continues to operate at near normal run-rates, however much of our work at the army\u2019s test ranges have been impacted by physical distancing requirements.In line with our nuclear remediation business, these are highly resistant, well-funded, I am sorry, high resilient, well-funded long-term programs that perform well in economic uncertainty but require on-site execution by our employees. Similar to the intelligence community our cyber work within our DOD portfolio remains strong. We expect COVID-19 to have a moderate impact to our second half results within our Defense business but normalize as we approach the end of our fiscal year.CMS International makes up about 10% of the business, which covers primarily Tier-1 nuclear decommissioning, and operations and maintenance services in the U.K. and Europe. Our international business also supports the U.K. Ministry of Defence on its Continuous At-Sea Deterrence program, and various sustainment programs for air and land defense in the UK and Australia.We expect our International business to be moderately impacted from COVID-19 in the second half of the year with approximately 70% of the impact coming from field work interruptions and 30% from consulting delays, but returning to normalized run-rate as we exit the fiscal year.Shifting to our commercial business, this makes up approximately 10% of CMS revenues. In telecom, we provide solutions for wireless and wireline networks including the buildout of 5G. We expect this sector to remain strong over the next several years.For the automotive sector, we primarily design and operate aerodynamic wind tunnels and provide general technical services, engineering, and testing of automotive engines. This business is being temporarily impacted by physical distancing and we expect new awards to be delayed as our clients re-evaluate their CapEx portfolio and future demand requirements.In summary, we continue to believe the COVID-19 impact on our CMS business to be temporary and not indicative of how the business would perform in a typical recession scenario. We are aligned to high-priority, mission critical areas of federal government budgets and our overall 2021 sales pipeline remains robust at more than $37 billion. Of this figure, we currently have over $17 billion in source selection, with a blended profitability above our current run-rate.Moving to our People and Places Solutions Business on slide 8. Our P&PS business continued its strong track record of performance in the second quarter with backlog up 5.4%. Q2 net revenue, excluding pass-throughs, was up10% year-over-year. We had several wins in the quarter that further validate our strategy to align the business to a diverse set of high priority public and private sector initiatives in resilient geographies.A recent selection as the prime consultant for a major U.S. Navy Environmental contract, expected to be a $480 million in fee over 5 years, underscores Jacobs\u2019 proven program management, environmental and PFAS expertise. We also continue to drive technology-enabled solutions across all facets of the portfolio.As an example, we were awarded what will be the largest PFAS groundwater treatment pilot program in the U.S. with Orange County, CA, drawing on our multidisciplinary capabilities across all markets. And in our water business we won a 20-year O&M program for the City of Wilmington Delaware, which will leverage predictive analytics to optimize operations.In addition, we recently leveraged our deep domain expertise to win a software development contract for the U.K.\u2019s national flood risk assessment and also won a mandate to deploy our AquaDNA software analytics solution at one of the world\u2019s largest water utilities.As evidenced by these superior client solutions, our strategic initiatives around global, market and digital connectivity are the basis for our continued double-digit profit growth trajectory over the last 18-months.Now, I will discuss how we expect COVID-19 to impact our P&PS business from a geographic and industry sector standpoint. Before doing so, I\u2019d like to discuss how we have not only adapted but optimized our delivery amidst COVID-19.Our distributed workforce has maintained business continuity, while generating accelerated opportunities for innovation. We continue to deliver world-class consultancy and design with the majority of staff working from home, while also utilizing video streaming, augmented reality, and other innovative techniques to perform site assessments, inspections and assist in equipment maintenance and plant operation, linking our experts globally to provide solutions in real-time. Our digitized project delivery platform has created increased efficiency and has enhanced our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions.Now to our buildings and infrastructure geographies, starting with the Americas, including our Federal business. This business comprises more than 50% of our P&PS net revenue. Going into the fiscal third quarter, I am sorry, going into third fiscal quarter of FY20, the Americas is one of our best performing regions with strong double-digit top and bottom-line growth across multiple sub-geographies and sectors.We continue to see healthy sales bookings activity even considering COVID-19 pressures, with some delays in new awards, but minimal cancellations at this point. However, our revenue burn rate is expected to decrease modestly in the second half.We are strategically maintaining a slightly higher cost structure, in retaining our talent in anticipation of a return to a more normalized demand level and potential U.S. infrastructure stimulus. Overall, we expect the Americas to experience a minimal COVID-19-based impact year-over-year, but a more pronounced impact compared to our growth expectations. Forward looking indicators imply improved conditions as we approach our fiscal year end.Turning to Europe and the Middle East, this geography represents approximately 20% of P&PS net revenue, with the U.K. making up the majority of the business. Prior to COVID-19 the U.K. was experiencing Brexit related slowdowns as the newly elected government was in the process of formalizing their plan for increased infrastructure investment and restarting major programs which were awaiting funding.Through our diverse offering, track record of performance and scale, we are uniquely engaged in all major infrastructure programs in the U.K. In fact, we were just awarded a 10-year Highways England Smart Motorways Alliance contract. High-Speed 2 is also moving forward, along with a pipeline of smaller projects within existing framework agreements. However, we are cautious on our near-term expectations for a broader post-COVID-19 ramp up in this geography and expect a moderately negative impact to results in fiscal Q3, improving modestly during fiscal Q4.Longer-term, we view Europe and the Middle East as strategic geographies that will not only prioritize infrastructure spending but will also serve as an innovation hub for the latest digital infrastructure solutions.Moving to Asia, which represents just under 10% of P&PS net revenue with Australia and New Zealand comprising the majority of that business. While the pipeline of new opportunities remains robust, we are witnessing delays in some aviation related and other projects tied to government tax revenue associated with the downturn in commodities.We expect Asia to be materially impacted in fiscal Q3 2020 and improve as we reposition our resources targeting developing opportunities in healthcare facilities and transportation.And finally, our Advanced Facilities business, which makes up approximately 20% of P&PS net revenue, will likely see the most pronounced COVID-19-related impacts for the business in the short-term given physical distancing constraints at some of our sites.A key factor is our Life Sciences customers realigning their capital portfolio to COVID-19-related solutions and changes in supply chain strategies related to other therapies. We believe this business has the most potential for a sharp V-shaped recovery driven by multiple large scale COVID-19-related therapies and vaccine projects in the pipeline, where we are well positioned as the global leader.In fact, we are currently performing early conceptual designs for these life sciences and mission critical projects. In addition, cloud computing driven projects such as semiconductor fabs and data centers are likely to be awarded in the coming months.Our advanced facilities business is one of the areas we are the most optimistic about with the developing momentum we expect to play out over the course of 2021 and beyond.As we turn to our core sectors, while global restriction in mobility has resulted in reduced demand across all modes of transportation, much of the market\u2019s critical infrastructure projects have been sustained through recent government stimulus packages. We anticipate that future transportation-related stimulus will catalyze and drive economic recovery.Moving to the water and environmental sector, we are seeing strong long-term demand in both upgrades to water infrastructure and our utility operations and maintenance business. From an environmental standpoint our PFAS and FEMA-related businesses are expected to grow, partially offset from short-term impact from physical distancing in our field work and private sector environmental consulting.And in our built environment, which includes government facilities, healthcare, higher education, and smart cities, we anticipate near-term headwinds to be offset by solid demand in healthcare as clients rethink their evolving resiliency requirements.We also expect a growing demand from our higher-education and sports and entertainment clients reshaping their infrastructure preparedness for the threat of future pandemics.In summary, we have taken a proactive approach to assessing the shifting market trends into a living roadmap, we call the Now to Next initiative. This initiative, along with our proven track record of execution, reinforces our global, market and digital connectivity strategy.Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Kevin?\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. I am now going to discuss more detailed summary of our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on slide 9.Second quarter gross revenue increased 11% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue including KeyW, but excluding the stub period from three weeks of Wood Nuclear, up 7.5%, with 10% growth coming from P&PS and 4% growth from CMS.Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the success in delivering our cost synergy targets for the CH2M acquisition, as some of that benefit has accrued to our clients via lower overhead reimbursement rates in some contracts.The lower reimbursement rate, of course, is more than offset by the absolute lower level of G&A costs. The impact remains a net positive to the company. That is exhibited by the lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.8%.It was also positively impacted by lower travel and employee related costs associated with some early impacts from COVID-19 cost mitigation efforts. In short, the improved G&A level as a percent of Net Revenue continues to show improved growth leverage for the company.GAAP operating profit was up 63% to $168 million and included $44 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, and $24 million of other charges consisting of $22 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, and $2 million of costs associated with the Worley transition service agreementsAdjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $237 million, up 7% from the prior year. Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 8.5%, down 50 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a decrease in CMS, flat performance in PPS, and higher unallocated corporate expense. I\u2019ll discuss the underlying drivers for the lines of business and corporate costs on the next slide.GAAP Net Earnings and EPS from continuing operations were a negative $122 million or $0.92 per share and included, a charge for the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake and other ECR related matters of $1.94, $0.25 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges as noted above, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.12.Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.39, including a $0.07 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was up 11% year-over-year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $261 million, or 9.4% of net revenue, and met our expectations for the quarter.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio approached 1.1 for Q2, driven by a strong CMS book to bill of approximately 1.2 times and a solid 1x book to bill for P&PS. As Bob noted earlier, the sales pipeline remains robust across both lines of business and has increased on a like for like basis when compared to last year and last quarter.While we have seen some delays in expected award dates, we have seen very few cancellations. We continue to be optimistic that our pipeline will convert in a manner that will set the company up well for 2021.Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to slide 10. Starting with CMS, pro forma revenue including KeyW, but excluding the stub period from Wood Nuclear grew 4% year-over-year during the second quarter.During the quarter we saw continued strength in our Cyber, Space including NASA, Mission IT and 5G businesses. Operating profit was $84 million and grew 14% year-over-year and in the single digits on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was down 20 basis points year-over-year to 6.8%, as a result of higher benefit related costs in the quarter. Excluding this impact, underlying adjusted OP margin was up over 20 basis points year ago.In early April, it was exciting to see the initial impacts of the ramp up on the two major new business wins at Navy West Sound and the Air Force research laboratory. However, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, we are expecting a short-term headwind from physical distancing in CMS, mainly in our nuclear remediation business, DOD range operations business, and our commercial business, where a physical presence is necessary.In fact, some of the impact from physical distancing headwinds will result in us recognizing revenue with lower associated or any associated profit. This is due to the U.S. government reimbursing us for our idle employee related costs but not paying us for our fees earned, which represent our profit, as there is a delay in our ability to reach milestones which allow fee benefits to be realized.It is important to note that in a more typical economic slowdown the operating profit from these types of businesses would be highly resilient, as these on-premise and other key programs are well-funded under multi-year contracts.This dynamic will result in a more pronounced impact to operating profit than revenue in our third quarter. On a reported basis we expect CMS operating profit to be down double-digit year-over-year in the third quarter, but with an improved performance in the fourth quarter, which has the potential for year-over-year growth.Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue grew 10% year-over-year and operating profit was up 9%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.3% for the quarter, flat from a year ago and a strong performance given the overhead reimbursable rate issue noted earlier, the strong project mix in the year ago quarter, and headwinds from maintaining talent capacity in the U.K. in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Americas business continued to post strong double-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth. This strength was somewhat offset by softness in the U.K. and timing on major project starts in Advanced Facilities.While we have started strong in the first half of the year, we anticipate reported revenue and operating profit to be down year-over-year in the third quarter, and then begin to see a less negative impact in Q4, as the business recovers to a year-over-year growth outlook in fiscal 2021.Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $37 million for the quarter, up slightly from the Q1 figures and up from $25 million in the year ago period, driven by higher benefit costs.For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect non-allocated corporate costs to approximate $35 million per quarter, absent any allocation reductions to the line of business given our overall efforts to reduce our overhead cost structure in the second half of this year.Now turning to slide 11, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Regarding the sale of ECR, to date we have incurred slightly over $220 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect the remaining costs to be incurred over the remainder of the year.The KeyW integration is largely complete and delivering the expected cost reductions, and the team is now focused on leveraging the resources of both companies to drive further revenue synergies.Our acquisition of Wood\u2019s Nuclear business closed on March 6th. Our integration management office is well underway executing against our acquisition playbook. In-line with our playbook, the combined management structure was rolled out on day 1 and the team is executing to deliver the expected $12 million in annual cost synergies. Of course, the overall focus on the strategic logic for the combination and the strategic growth benefits also remains a high priority.Please note that our overall expectations regarding the P&L and cash flow impacts related to separation, restructuring and other transaction related expenses for the full year 2020 remain intact, with approximately $150 million in P&L costs and cash outflow expected over the course of this year. And, as we enter 2021, again its important to note that material differences in GAAP versus adjusted figures will be significantly reduced.Now onto cash flow generation and the balance sheet on slide 12. During the quarter, we generated $113 million in free cash flow. Q2 cash flow was impacted actually by approximately $36 million of restructuring and separation related cash outflows. $85 million has been incurred year-to-date.Including these costs, we continue to expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of fiscal 2020 with total reported free cash flow now expected to be more than $350 million for the full year, which includes a headwind of $150 million from the restructuring items noted above.Assumed in our free cash flow guidance is some expectation that the timing of some customer payments could be impacted over the course of the year given COVID-19.DSO\u2019s were flat from Q1 2020 but up year-over-year. Of note, approximately $50 million of collections were received in late March, but after our quarter end of March 27th. We still see ample opportunities to lower our DSO run-rate which we believe is the major driver for us attaining a one time free cash flow conversion target longer term.And now moving to the balance sheet. As part of our planned capital structure strategy, we executed a 5-year $1 billion unsecured term loan facility during the quarter at an attractive rate of approximately LIBOR, plus a 150 basis points. In addition, we entered into multiple interest rate swaps at different tenors with an aggregate notional value of $900 million to lock in long term effective rates approaching nearly 50% of our total debt.The interest cost approximates an aggregate 2% yield for the fixed portion, and we are pleased that we were able to lock in longer term rates that approximate our short-term rate levels.We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.7 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.4 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to adjusted 2020 EBITDA is just over one time.As you will note, we chose not to pay down our revolver with the proceeds of the term loan, out of an abundance of caution given the disruption seen in the financial markets in March and April due to the COVID-19 situation. We will continue to monitor and proactively paydown the revolver as markets continue to show increased levels of stability.Regarding capital deployment, we paused our share purchases in March as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Nonetheless, we still repurchased $286 million of shares during the March quarter, and ended the quarter with a remaining $1.1 billion left of authorization.We continue to expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time. However, I reiterate that our immediate use of existing excess cash will be focused on paying down our revolver as market conditions warranted.For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of 132 million for second half of fiscal year 2020, excluding additional share buybacks. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buy-back activity going forward and we\u2019ll provide an update on our quarterly earnings calls related to share count expectations.And regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the second half of fiscal 2020, in line with our longer-term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%.Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was previously increased and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year-ago.Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on slide 13\nSteven Demetriou: Thanks, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook to account for the expected impact from COVID-19 on our business over the remainder of fiscal 2020 year.We are updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $950 million to $1.05 billion from our previous range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We are also updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, to a range of $4.80 to $5.30 from $5.30 to $5.80.At the mid-point of our revised EPS range, 2020 fiscal year adjusted EPS represents year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from fiscal 2020 and 2019 discrete tax items.Our revised guidance is based on an analysis of several scenarios that estimated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results. Specifically, physical distancing initiatives, which create temporary limitations on our clients\u2019 and Jacobs\u2019 ability to perform work primarily in the current fiscal Q3 period is the single biggest impact on these projections.The gross impact to EPS is estimated at approximately $1.50 at the midpoint of our estimates. Included in that estimate is approximately $100 million investment to retain talent, equivalent to approximately $0.50 per share. Importantly, we have strategically decided that we will maintain this talented workforce given our belief that we expect a rebound later this year, thereby ensuring access to this talent as we return to growth.We have taken significant actions to reduce this gross impact by reducing our cost structure, effectively reducing costs in the back half of the year by $1 of EPS. These efforts include elimination of discretionary, corporate, LOB and other employee related costs.As a result, our net expected impact at the midpoint of our range is $0.50 per share based on our decision to maintain our existing work force and to ensure that we have access to our talent to drive the expected return to growth. We believe it is a strategic imperative to retain our talented people across the company.We expect the majority of the earnings revision to occur in our third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate the impact of the pandemic on Jacobs to subside and our business to return to run-rate levels over the course of the fourth quarter.Importantly, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to improve with potential for year-over-year growth. As previously stated, we expect strong fiscal second half reported free cash flow of at least $400 million. And we believe that 2021 is shaping up for a strong rebound in growth. We\u2019ll provide an update as we approach the end of this fiscal year as we further evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.With that, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the call.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hey. Good evening, guys. Steve, you've obviously spent a lot of time in the last two years kind of reshaping the portfolio, I'm wondering if you could just provide your thoughts on how impactful what we're going through now is on that going forward. I'm not asking you for kind of guidance on what markets you might invest into. I'm sure that's sensitive for competitive reasonsBut do you see opportunities emerging from this or are those opportunities kind of more on the margins, just trying to get a sense for how material you think you need to adapt the business to what's happening?\nSteven Demetriou: Sure. Look I think all the work that we did over the last several years strategically is fortuitous, now as we go through this pandemic. When we did that work, we did a lot of strategic analysis on how this will make us a much more resilient company. And even though we're going through a temporary downturn, it's a result of something that you know, none of us ever predicted and that would be that we would be unable to physically go to work, our clients wouldn\u2019t be able to physically go to work, all that is gone through a correction.What we hear and see from our client based on our pipeline that's surging projects and programs that are not getting canceled, they're just moving to the right, that this resilient portfolio will continue to play out and gives us optionality as we move into fiscal 2021. There will be certain sectors amongst our portfolio, a very diverse portfolio that should be clear winners and others that you know, are going to be under pressure.And we're already in that transition of redeploying our workforces, going quickly our workforce to be able to address an attack that - those sectors that you mentioned, that should be big winners as we go into 2021.So you know, we're actually pretty positive about \u201821 and look forward to getting through this his current quarter.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Kevin, just on the trimming of $100 million of EBITDA from this year, how much of that just goes away versus you know, being able to recoup that or is there kind of a lingering effect from some of the headwinds into next year?\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, I think - thanks for the question, Joe. We're not going to really talk about 2021. Today although we gave very clear views as it relates to our return to a more normalized level of performance. So I won't go further than that. But I do think that the dynamic of those $100 million, some of that is temporary in nature to ultimately help support our ability to deliver the results in the guidance that we've provided. And then some of that will start to get back at it and reinvesting in certain parts of the business.So I think the fundamental way to think about it is, as we've got this revenue decline in the short term, which then affects ultimately the profitability pretty immediately because we're keeping our talent in place, so that drop in revenue almost falls to the bottom line. We're being very, very diligent and aggressive and - in eliminating kind of almost all discretionary travel and other related costs.And the good news about this though is that we're learning a lot due to some of the things that are happening from working from home and some of the productivity we're seeing, which is good to see, that we're going to take that learning and be able to leverage on that to 2021 and beyond.So not all of it's going to go away, but certainly there is a big chunk that we're just doing it to make sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, our employees and our other stakeholders.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then in CMS I mean, book-to-bill are very, very good, ranks pretty well amongst your peers on that side of the business. When does that actually start to translate into maybe more material organic growth within CMS? Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: Well, probably within the next two to four quarters. It's kind of a 6 to 12 month book-and-burn type of cycle and those two - the two big drivers that that drove that book-to-bill ratio, Joe, were long term contracts, I'd give it two to four quarters.\nJoseph DeNardi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Good afternoon, gentlemen.\nSteven Demetriou: Hey, Mike.\nKevin Berryman: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Steve, very, very - pretty good presentation, very detailed and thoughtful. As you are in the midst of the crisis, do you anticipate as we move through this, will Jacobs as an organization drive more business because your clients are going to pull more opportunities from you or you have the technology and the skill sets to push more solutions on the business where as we look towards \u201920, \u201821 and \u201822 there overall could be maybe a tailwind in a sense because of the changes in the new normal?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes. Well, again as I started to address that Michael in the first question. I think we're well positioned and what we believe we're going to be all the sort of critical missions and critical activities that are going to go on as we emerge from this COVID-19.And the Life Sciences business is a great example of one, you know, we're an industry leader there. That business has been a very global business and I think is - we believe now is going through a temporary transition to kind of reconfigure the whole supply chain and how to not only you know address the near-term opportunity of therapies and vaccines associated with COVID-19, but really to become more resilient in the event that this type of pandemic or something else happens which has created supply chain issues. And so these are initiatives that you know, we're in the mix on and we're well positioned to capitalize on that, no matter what the outcome is because of our global integrated delivery, our capabilities and our industry-leading position.And so, whether it's life sciences, healthcare, cybersecurity and of course, the critical missions that we do across our CMS business, which have been sort of on temporary hold are going to have to get at it, and we're positioned. You know, you think of the whole CARES Act, that whole CARES act that has supported our businesses to make our talent mission-ready for the essential critical work that's going to have to get done as soon as everyone gets back to work over the next several months. And so you know, there's a tremendous opportunity unfolding for us and we feel like we're well positioned.\nMichael Dudas: Duly noted. My follow up would be maybe for Bob, you highlighted the social distancing and the mitigation that you and your clients are going through in the field and your opportunities. Is there - do you have a sense of protocol that you're basing this towards in the - later this year. Do you anticipate in 2021 and beyond what we're seeing now and how you're working is how it's going to be? Or is there - these are difficult for a sense of more normalcy that comes back as our society evolves, given that what we've been going through?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Mike, I don't think we know the timeline. And so what we're doing in preparation of - instead of preparing for a world post-COVID, we're kind of preparing for a world with Covid and using technology is our friend. And so those physical distancing requirements, let's just take a field application and this applies to both CMNS, as well as PPS, we're developing - actually we have in-house technology around this with our ION platform where we're wearing bracelets that determine how far we are from each other, as well as contact tracing throughout the entirety of different sites or bases.So clearly it's a world that we're not anticipating and we look at our future projections. We're not putting a timeline on. Well, things are going to go back to the way they were on February 1st on X date. We're anticipating that it's going to be going longer.\nMichael Dudas: Understood. Appreciate your thoughts, gentlemen. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. You guys talked about a number of programs where you expect to ramp back up to targeted profitability levels really by the fourth quarter. It sound like what are all the most important things that have to happen to achieve that. And how much of that do you think is within your control?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes. Well, I think we said it in our stated remarks that we're attributing 90% of the shortfall to this whole physical distancing limitation. So clearly, a key assumption you know and everything and we're talking about is that, that that's going to start to subside. Governments lift restrictions not only here in the U.S. of different city states, but across the globe.And that all takes place through the course of the remainder of this year. We're not assuming any accelerated basis but, that it gradually happens as - you know, as we're all starting to see. But it's going to happen throughout the third and fourth quarter. So that's you know, that's the major assumption. That's clearly not in our control.And so I think that's kind of a simple answer to your question as far as what's the key driver. Because once that happens I think that's the message we're trying to make sure that you all understand. This is a situation where the demand is sitting there and we just - we and our clients have to physically get back at it.So this is not a situation where projects have been cancelled and we're trying to rebuild the pipeline. We have a record high pipeline. Our backlog has grown. We just got to physically get back to work enough, not the way it used to be, but to a certain level recognizing that we probably as a company will continue to have remote working forever.Now that we've learned that in certain areas it's a more efficient, effective basis. But where we do need the face to face physical interactions and engagement with our clients. That's the key assumption around what we're talking about today.\nSteven Fisher: Got it. And then your global design center concept has been a very unique element of your margin enhancement opportunities. I am just curious how that usage is ramping up Q2? And then really how you think this new working model will impact the use of the design centers. Is that really an opportunity as everyone learns how to work more remotely is that an even better opportunity to leverage the design centers.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Steve, it's Bob. We actually see it as what's happening now, as a catalyst to even drive that strategy at a faster rate. What we've seen specifically in areas like Poland and India and Southeast Asia is - it is an incredible - an incredible level of efficiency as people go to remote and still operating in a design center capacity. And so I think that what's happening now is definitely going to serve as an accelerator for driving connected delivery and integrated delivery to another level.And then as we look forward to kind of the future of the workplace, we are going to have centers that require project collaboration with people in those centers. And so we're looking at layouts and workplace strategies that are unique by the different function of that operation or that office.And so a design center might have a different layout and say its a hub or a client site which might have more - I'm making this up, conference-based rather than workspace cubicles that are socially distance apart from each other.So we're right in the midst of all of that, it's part of that now to next kind of initiative, as we look forward in new markets and new ways of doing things from this dislocation.\nSteven Fisher: What was the ramp up this quarter on that. Is there a percentage increase in usage or anything you can give?\nSteven Demetriou: I don't have a exact percentage but I'd say it's been greater than it was in previous quarters.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good evening and hope everyone is - glad to hear everyone's well and healthy. I guess my first question just on the guide, Kevin when you talked about the COVID impact and you talked about you know, the EBITDA and EPS impact, but is there any way you can help us understand the impact across the two different segments CMS and P&PS if possible.And then also just try to understand you know just the cash flow dynamics, I understand why you lowered. However, I'm just trying to understand the impact on cap [ph] what you assume for DSOs by the end of the year where they can go. And then is the CMS cash flow holding better, we're hearing from other contractors that you know government is - d the governor is actually paying their employees quicker. Thanks.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. So thanks for the question. Jamie I just. I'll give you some general commentary to give some perspective on the two businesses. The actual kind of dynamics in CMS in Q3 specifically have a greater impact associated with some of the comment that both Steve and Bob just made as it relates to the physical distancing.You think about certainly the nuclear work and some of the other things that we talked about commercial. We actually have to be onsite and certainly the - some of the test range work as well. So that ends up being a bigger impact to CMS. So if you look at versus the size of the business, the majority or the larger piece, I should say in terms of costs or terms as a percentage basis or more CMS based and in 2020 third quarter. But there we\u2019re expecting a challenge in both of the business versus a year ago. So I would say a greater percentage reduction in Q3 for CMS.And then I think ultimately as we transition to Q4, certainly an improving dynamic in CMS and probably a more - a little bit more elongated recovery for PPS just because of the shifting of the portfolios as Bob was characterizing in terms of re-jiggering of pipeline and some of the customers thinking relative to the shaping change of the opportunities.Having said all of that, I will say you know, we're now a few weeks into Q3 and I would say we're encouraged by the views and in the things that we're seeing relative to customers and how they're affecting and our business relative to how we're driving that. So we're being prudent with our view of what the impact is and we're going to see how we play out and ultimately get back at it in 2021.As it relates to cash flow, the second part of that question, I think look, where we took the cash flow guide a little bit down, obviously EBITDA impacted and so certainly part of its there and then the other part is associated with what we're suggesting is a potential as it relates to some disruption on the collection side.We're actually seeing pretty good performance as you suggested on the CMS side. So we're just thinking that it might be more about P&PS. But we'll play that out. And so far we're actually seeing pretty good, pretty good performance through the first parts of Q3.\nJamie Cook: And I'm sorry do you want to commit to sort of where we think it can be by year end?\nKevin Berryman: No I think we're going to - we're going to hold tight and see how it plays out. But look I think it's embedded into that that new cash flow number, so to be honest they can't fall out of bed, if we're sitting there with the 300 - 350 for the year, free cash flow.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nKevin Berryman: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. I'm wondering if you could give us some color on the - of bookings as we move through the rest of the calendar year. You still expect kind of a calendar Q3 budget flush at CMS and maybe you could just characterize sort of the front log. What \u2013 how the RFP pipeline coming through and how much and where things might be stretching if at all?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So, Gautam, this is Bob. So it is a bit of a different story between CMS and P&PS. And so let me kind of take them both separately. CMS, we see the - talked about it in the script. The pipeline is strong and the pace and velocity of our proposal activity probably hasn't been stronger. And so that has been a pretty strong cadence that it's only been a bit not stifled but slowed when we have those confidential or those secure proposals that we have. We can only do the proposal in a skiff and though we have skiffs within our real estate portfolio at times we have to use our clients as well. So say that strong and we see the award cycles not fundamentally shifting, so that pipeline remains very resilient.On P&PS, again as Steven and Kevin have mentioned before, this isn't a matter of cancellations, it's probably more a matter of some shifting of the pipeline. So we see that bookings target. We're still confident that we can be right on where we had projected, but we're tracking that week for week for potential slippages and most of that is coming from the fact that at our state and local business these are our clients that are probably getting more accustomed to - are becoming a little slower and getting accustomed to working from home then maybe we are.And so we're assisting our clients in the evaluation of these proposals. It's not that they're going away, it's just kind of the piece by which they could be reviewed and awarded.In our private sector business, it's actually been surprisingly resilient. And in fact, we've received some - just recent, can't disclose them, just recent awards from some of our larger private sector clients in the - from beginning to end through evaluation to award, all of those were done remotely. And so it's overall kind of a balanced approach there. We feel confident on this the - on the forecast.\nSteven Demetriou: Yes, one thing I want to add here on top of what Bob talked about in addition to the size of the pipeline and everything that Bob talked about, as far as the pace is the margin in the pipeline is also improving. And we've got - you know, we've really upgraded our capability to measure and monitor this over the last 12 to 18 months.And as we look at that pipeline that Bob talked about compared to a year ago, the margin is a significant improvement, so which bodes well for our strategic goal of not only profitably growing, but increasing the margin of Jacob's.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks guys for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color. To be clear, I know EBITDA is expected to grow in 2021. Is there some expectations that we could see the weakness in the second half of this year lead into the first half - in the first half of next year in that PPS segment? Because it seems there's a lot of confidence that CMS kind of inflects in the fourth quarter. But could PSS with the delays and maybe pressure on public budgets and the small local and state municipalities, is there an issue that can bleed, can some of these delays bleed into the first half of next year?\nSteven Demetriou: Well, let me start and then Bob maybe build on it. You started getting into an area that we're all watching closely is how, what's going to happen now on a state and local level because you know the government in the US has done a great job to really support the defense and civil you know, the federal side. And now what know we're looking anxiously, looking forward to seeing what they do with the next round of cares, hopefully in the next few weeks around state and local.And you know, there's a lot of positive news coming out that you know, I think everyone expects that they're going to provide relief to that sector. And so that should start to provide some good foundation as we enter 2021.And then the other piece is that, you know, there's a lot of discussion about, finally because this has been going on for years even pre-COVID is, the need for a big federal infrastructure stimulator to really get people going, putting the work, back to work around addressing the crisis across the nation on highways, bridges, a whole host of areas, you know, the need to continue to accelerate water and wastewater - and the whole broadband and everything else.So we're hoping and monitoring that and lobbying and very active on the hill to hopefully see later this year Congress could finally get at that that big infrastructure stimulus, whether that happens later this year or leaks into early next year, that's a real positive for Jacobs.And so you know, I think that's going to play a piece of what kind of momentum. If nothing happens and you know, there's a big vacuum on supporting the state local side. Yes, that could provide some headwinds over the next six plus months. But Bob\u2026\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So it would maybe I'll also a bit talk about where we're positioned and we saw this you know in previous cycles as well. And I think it's actually even strengthened during this dislocation is the depth of intimacy we have with our clients. There was a previous question about what we can control and what we can't control.What we can't control is our ability to solve our client's deepest challenges and right now our clients are experiencing challenges that they've never even seen before. And with our, whether it be a framework agreement that we've had for decades and that\u2019s CMS and P&PS alike or you know newer clients that we're now getting into different types of solutions over providing.We're getting to a point where whenever it comes back and it might be a step change in one part of our business and more of a trend in the other part of our business. I would say that we are better positioned now to capitalize on that than we ever have been ever. And we have been in a good position in the past as well. So we're positive about that.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you. That was helpful. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Australia and how you saw aviation and lower tax revenue due to the lower commodities and you think it's going to hit Q3 and then should recover in Q4. Can you just flesh out why that, that is the case. I understand the limitation, fiscal limitations and the shortfall from COVID being able to get to certain sites and the impact that's having there. But why for example, that example you provided with Australia, why does that just be isolated into Q3 and then we had that recovery in the Q4?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, because I think that there were tailwinds going into COVID, that COVID magnified. And so you know the commodity crisis though was exacerbated and effectively magnified as a result of everything that we've read about in the news, whether it be oil or gas or even in the metals commodities, COVID accelerated it to where now the need for government intervention was further accentuated.And so, I think the speed by which we're seeing government intervention in, whether it be in Singapore and Australia or New Zealand, it's faster and it's already happening.\nMichael Feniger: Perfect. And just lastly, I mean, on the free cash flow is there anything we should be aware of when we turn to page 20, 21\u2026\nRobert Pragada: Hello? Next question.\nOperator: Thank you.\nSteven Demetriou: Jump back in the queue.\nRobert Pragada: You need to get in there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color today. My question is just you know, as we look at the margin being up in the bid pipeline, I'm just curious if there's sensitivity to that assessment around the macro environment? To what extent is the bid pipeline price sensitive? And you know is there kind of a risk that you know, the assessment of that margin profile on the work you're looking at could degrade?\nSteven Demetriou: Well, you know, I think the margin improvement is less about pricing and more about mix and the type of programs and projects we\u2019re strategically going after. So look, I think everything always has you know, a potential to be under pressure, under certain situations when you talk about margin.But I think we're confident in the margin profile improvement because it's been a strategic emphasis on driving a different approach on the type of things that we're going after and prioritizing you know, rather than as we started this transformation journey several years ago it was like let's just sort of go after everything that we can and it's much more of a strategic approach now, as we've you advanced the company, culture around strategy. So we would say that it's a pretty solid profile, less around macroeconomics and more about delivering on winning those new types of businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Good evening. Just on the intelligent - on the intelligent asset management vertical. You had the recent win at the Kitsap base in Washington. Can you give us any color, any early read on that contract? And I'm curious if, you know, your other intelligent asset contracts at Mayport or Langley, are you seeing interest to expand their scope to address the virus?\nSteven Demetriou: So the short answer Josh, is yes, we are seeing interest to expand our scope, talk specifically on the first part of your question with regards to the West sound contract in Washington with NASA. That's a really unique case. One, the team did a fantastic job on winning that with a differentiated solution and then keep in mind, we were awarded and had to mobilize in the midst of COVID. And we interviewed selected and mobilized folks all virtually and it was a true testament to our team and in CMS, led by Steve Arnett.. He did bit a - the team did a fantastic job at that.I think others are catching part especially when you talk about Mayport and specifically other NASA-type facilities. And so I think that differentiator of, yes, we can provide more value from the actual asset Intelligent Asset Management offering, but we don't need this prolonged, very in-depth and laborious mobilization plan in the means and methods and how we do it is going to lead to even greater growth.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow up you know, as far as the bid pipeline, any would say or quantify what percentage is in intelligence assets?\nSteven Demetriou: I might have to get back to you on that one. It's - you know, it's kind of weaved into a lot of our offering, but as far as giving you an exact number as a percent of the pipeline, I probably needed to follow up on that.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Andrew Wittman with Baird.\nAndrew Wittman: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to just do a couple of cleanup questions because I think all the big picture and other questions have been taking care of here. But I wanted to understand here if in the quarter there were any award fees, project closeouts or the like that were reported in the results that we should know about impacting the quarter. Obviously these come up from time to time and didn't have a comment, so I thought I'd ask.\nSteven Demetriou: We always we always have that Andrew, but ultimately not mature at all in the quarter.\nAndrew Wittman: Okay. And then just as it relates to some of the more newly acquired companies here obviously Wood groups closed in the quarter, I was wondering what the contribution from that was to the backlog, as well as the maybe the total amount of revenues from that and KeyW that were recognized in the quarter?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes. The new backlog from Wood was just over $400, about $4.25 million. And then what was the second part of the question.\nAndrew Wittman: The acquired revenues from KeyW and Wood in the quarter.\nSteven Demetriou: From KeyW I don't have that handy, but the stop period for Wood was very, very small, probably about $20 million or so.\nAndrew Wittman: Thanks.\nOperator: There is no additional callers in the queue, sir. Are there any closing comments or remarks.\nJonathan Doros: Yes, we're going to be closing comments.\nSteven Demetriou: All right. So thanks everyone. Our transformation over the last 4 years as we just discussed during Q&A is been focused on building a strong culture and a portfolio which would prove resilient under multiple economic scenarios. Clearly COVID-19 is presenting a challenge that no one could not have predicted. But our transformation is proving to be the foundation that\u2019s going to help us see - us through this all \u2013 through this successfully. We are keeping our people safe, delivering on our commitments to our clients. We are also moving with swiftness and agility, shifting our work model to ensure business continuity and we\u2019re in the process of accelerating our digital transformation plan. And most importantly, we are retaining our most important asset, our talent to people. And so as we define how we\u2019re going to work in the future, we expect to benefit from significant cost savings, as well as further positive cultural benefits and the flexibility for our people and advancements in how we serve our clients. And that future starts now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that now concludes the call. You may disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. I am now going to discuss more detailed summary of our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on slide 9.Second quarter gross revenue increased 11% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue including KeyW, but excluding the stub period from three weeks of Wood Nuclear, up 7.5%, with 10% growth coming from P&PS and 4% growth from CMS.Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the success in delivering our cost synergy targets for the CH2M acquisition, as some of that benefit has accrued to our clients via lower overhead reimbursement rates in some contracts.The lower reimbursement rate, of course, is more than offset by the absolute lower level of G&A costs. The impact remains a net positive to the company. That is exhibited by the lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.8%.It was also positively impacted by lower travel and employee related costs associated with some early impacts from COVID-19 cost mitigation efforts. In short, the improved G&A level as a percent of Net Revenue continues to show improved growth leverage for the company.GAAP operating profit was up 63% to $168 million and included $44 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, and $24 million of other charges consisting of $22 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, and $2 million of costs associated with the Worley transition service agreementsAdjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $237 million, up 7% from the prior year. Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 8.5%, down 50 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a decrease in CMS, flat performance in PPS, and higher unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers for the lines of business and corporate costs on the next slide.GAAP Net Earnings and EPS from continuing operations were a negative $122 million or $0.92 per share and included, a charge for the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake and other ECR related matters of $1.94, $0.25 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges as noted above, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.12.Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.39, including a $0.07 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was up 11% year-over-year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $261 million, or 9.4% of net revenue, and met our expectations for the quarter.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio approached 1.1 for Q2, driven by a strong CMS book to bill of approximately 1.2 times and a solid 1x book to bill for P&PS. As Bob noted earlier, the sales pipeline remains robust across both lines of business and has increased on a like for like basis when compared to last year and last quarter.While we have seen some delays in expected award dates, we have seen very few cancellations. We continue to be optimistic that our pipeline will convert in a manner that will set the company up well for 2021.Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to slide 10. Starting with CMS, pro forma revenue including KeyW, but excluding the stub period from Wood Nuclear grew 4% year-over-year during the second quarter.During the quarter we saw continued strength in our Cyber, Space including NASA, Mission IT and 5G businesses. Operating profit was $84 million and grew 14% year-over-year and in the single digits on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was down 20 basis points year-over-year to 6.8%, as a result of higher benefit related costs in the quarter. Excluding this impact, underlying adjusted OP margin was up over 20 basis points year ago.In early April, it was exciting to see the initial impacts of the ramp up on the two major new business wins at Navy West Sound and the Air Force research laboratory. However, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, we are expecting a short-term headwind from physical distancing in CMS, mainly in our nuclear remediation business, DOD range operations business, and our commercial business, where a physical presence is necessary.In fact, some of the impact from physical distancing headwinds will result in us recognizing revenue with lower associated or any associated profit. This is due to the U.S. government reimbursing us for our idle employee related costs but not paying us for our fees earned, which represent our profit, as there is a delay in our ability to reach milestones which allow fee benefits to be realized.It is important to note that in a more typical economic slowdown the operating profit from these types of businesses would be highly resilient, as these on-premise and other key programs are well-funded under multi-year contracts.This dynamic will result in a more pronounced impact to operating profit than revenue in our third quarter. On a reported basis we expect CMS operating profit to be down double-digit year-over-year in the third quarter, but with an improved performance in the fourth quarter, which has the potential for year-over-year growth.Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue grew 10% year-over-year and operating profit was up 9%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.3% for the quarter, flat from a year ago and a strong performance given the overhead reimbursable rate issue noted earlier, the strong project mix in the year ago quarter, and headwinds from maintaining talent capacity in the U.K. in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Americas business continued to post strong double-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth. This strength was somewhat offset by softness in the U.K. and timing on major project starts in Advanced Facilities.While we have started strong in the first half of the year, we anticipate reported revenue and operating profit to be down year-over-year in the third quarter, and then begin to see a less negative impact in Q4, as the business recovers to a year-over-year growth outlook in fiscal 2021.Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $37 million for the quarter, up slightly from the Q1 figures and up from $25 million in the year ago period, driven by higher benefit costs.For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect non-allocated corporate costs to approximate $35 million per quarter, absent any allocation reductions to the line of business given our overall efforts to reduce our overhead cost structure in the second half of this year.Now turning to slide 11, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Regarding the sale of ECR, to date we have incurred slightly over $220 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect the remaining costs to be incurred over the remainder of the year.The KeyW integration is largely complete and delivering the expected cost reductions, and the team is now focused on leveraging the resources of both companies to drive further revenue synergies.Our acquisition of Wood's Nuclear business closed on March 6th. Our integration management office is well underway executing against our acquisition playbook. In-line with our playbook, the combined management structure was rolled out on day 1 and the team is executing to deliver the expected $12 million in annual cost synergies. Of course, the overall focus on the strategic logic for the combination and the strategic growth benefits also remains a high priority.Please note that our overall expectations regarding the P&L and cash flow impacts related to separation, restructuring and other transaction related expenses for the full year 2020 remain intact, with approximately $150 million in P&L costs and cash outflow expected over the course of this year. And, as we enter 2021, again its important to note that material differences in GAAP versus adjusted figures will be significantly reduced.Now onto cash flow generation and the balance sheet on slide 12. During the quarter, we generated $113 million in free cash flow. Q2 cash flow was impacted actually by approximately $36 million of restructuring and separation related cash outflows. $85 million has been incurred year-to-date.Including these costs, we continue to expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of fiscal 2020 with total reported free cash flow now expected to be more than $350 million for the full year, which includes a headwind of $150 million from the restructuring items noted above.Assumed in our free cash flow guidance is some expectation that the timing of some customer payments could be impacted over the course of the year given COVID-19.DSO's were flat from Q1 2020 but up year-over-year. Of note, approximately $50 million of collections were received in late March, but after our quarter end of March 27th. We still see ample opportunities to lower our DSO run-rate which we believe is the major driver for us attaining a one time free cash flow conversion target longer term.And now moving to the balance sheet. As part of our planned capital structure strategy, we executed a 5-year $1 billion unsecured term loan facility during the quarter at an attractive rate of approximately LIBOR, plus a 150 basis points. In addition, we entered into multiple interest rate swaps at different tenors with an aggregate notional value of $900 million to lock in long term effective rates approaching nearly 50% of our total debt.The interest cost approximates an aggregate 2% yield for the fixed portion, and we are pleased that we were able to lock in longer term rates that approximate our short-term rate levels.We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.7 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.4 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to adjusted 2020 EBITDA is just over one time.As you will note, we chose not to pay down our revolver with the proceeds of the term loan, out of an abundance of caution given the disruption seen in the financial markets in March and April due to the COVID-19 situation. We will continue to monitor and proactively paydown the revolver as markets continue to show increased levels of stability.Regarding capital deployment, we paused our share purchases in March as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Nonetheless, we still repurchased $286 million of shares during the March quarter, and ended the quarter with a remaining $1.1 billion left of authorization.We continue to expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time. However, I reiterate that our immediate use of existing excess cash will be focused on paying down our revolver as market conditions warranted.For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of 132 million for second half of fiscal year 2020, excluding additional share buybacks. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buy-back activity going forward and we'll provide an update on our quarterly earnings calls related to share count expectations.And regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the second half of fiscal 2020, in line with our longer-term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%.Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was previously increased and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year-ago.Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on slide 13 Yes. Look, I think - thanks for the question, Joe. We're not going to really talk about 2021. Today although we gave very clear views as it relates to our return to a more normalized level of performance. So I won't go further than that. But I do think that the dynamic of those $100 million, some of that is temporary in nature to ultimately help support our ability to deliver the results in the guidance that we've provided. And then some of that will start to get back at it and reinvesting in certain parts of the business.So I think the fundamental way to think about it is, as we've got this revenue decline in the short term, which then affects ultimately the profitability pretty immediately because we're keeping our talent in place, so that drop in revenue almost falls to the bottom line. We're being very, very diligent and aggressive and - in eliminating kind of almost all discretionary travel and other related costs.And the good news about this though is that we're learning a lot due to some of the things that are happening from working from home and some of the productivity we're seeing, which is good to see, that we're going to take that learning and be able to leverage on that to 2021 and beyond.So not all of it's going to go away, but certainly there is a big chunk that we're just doing it to make sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, our employees and our other stakeholders. Well, probably within the next two to four quarters. It's kind of a 6 to 12 month book-and-burn type of cycle and those two - the two big drivers that that drove that book-to-bill ratio, Joe, were long term contracts, I'd give it two to four quarters. Hi, Michael. Yes. So thanks for the question. Jamie I just. I'll give you some general commentary to give some perspective on the two businesses. The actual kind of dynamics in CMS in Q3 specifically have a greater impact associated with some of the comment that both Steve and Bob just made as it relates to the physical distancing.You think about certainly the nuclear work and some of the other things that we talked about commercial. We actually have to be onsite and certainly the - some of the test range work as well. So that ends up being a bigger impact to CMS. So if you look at versus the size of the business, the majority or the larger piece, I should say in terms of costs or terms as a percentage basis or more CMS based and in 2020 third quarter. But there we're expecting a challenge in both of the business versus a year ago. So I would say a greater percentage reduction in Q3 for CMS.And then I think ultimately as we transition to Q4, certainly an improving dynamic in CMS and probably a more - a little bit more elongated recovery for PPS just because of the shifting of the portfolios as Bob was characterizing in terms of re-jiggering of pipeline and some of the customers thinking relative to the shaping change of the opportunities.Having said all of that, I will say you know, we're now a few weeks into Q3 and I would say we're encouraged by the views and in the things that we're seeing relative to customers and how they're affecting and our business relative to how we're driving that. So we're being prudent with our view of what the impact is and we're going to see how we play out and ultimately get back at it in 2021.As it relates to cash flow, the second part of that question, I think look, where we took the cash flow guide a little bit down, obviously EBITDA impacted and so certainly part of its there and then the other part is associated with what we're suggesting is a potential as it relates to some disruption on the collection side.We're actually seeing pretty good performance as you suggested on the CMS side. So we're just thinking that it might be more about P&PS. But we'll play that out. And so far we're actually seeing pretty good, pretty good performance through the first parts of Q3. No I think we're going to - we're going to hold tight and see how it plays out. But look I think it's embedded into that that new cash flow number, so to be honest they can't fall out of bed, if we're sitting there with the 300 - 350 for the year, free cash flow. No problem."

            "name": "Steven Demetriou",
            "content": "All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our fiscal year second quarter results.Before I get started, I wanted to share our recent announcement on our launch of Jacobs' Climate Action Plan. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain focused on delivering on our strategy and advancing our purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world.We often say, we are a people business at Jacobs, which is why we must take actions that help sustain the world within which we all live. Jacobs' first Climate Action Plan sets us apart capturing the shared passion, pride and drive of our people, as we work to preserve the planet for future generations.The launch of this plan is another major milestone in our cultural and company transformation. Our collective focus on developing and delivering on our strategy, including a deliberate portfolio of transformation brings us to this important juncture. Together we are committing to 100% renewable energy and Net Zero Carbon by the end of 2020, with a long-term commitment to be carbon negative by 2030.Moving forward, we want to leverage our depth of expertise and leading position in the industry to work with our clients and our supply chain to drive climate resiliency into our solutions, investing together in projects that drive profitable reduction in carbon emissions. This is an exciting milestone in the company's history, and a course that we can take pride in delivering on together as we reinvent our tomorrow.Now turning to slide 5. Our new brand, Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow, has served as a strong galvanizing driver as we navigate through the COVID-19 environment. Throughout the past 8 weeks we have challenged the way in which we work and the markets we face and in the process, we are reinventing our tomorrow real-time through growth opportunities for our people and innovative offerings for our clients.From the outset of the pandemic, our focus has been the safety and well-being of our people, maintaining business continuity and delivering on our commitments to our clients.We mobilized a global, cross functional COVID-19 Critical Response Team led by our Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada to address both internal and external COVID-19 related challenges, with Regional Response Teams charged with rapid action on the ground.As soon as we learned that global travel was shown to be at the root of the continued spread of the virus and physical distancing was critical to flattening that curve, we took early, immediate and decisive action to restrict travel and to maximize remote working. Except for mission-critical employees, all of our people have been successfully working remotely over the last two months.Proactive, engaging and transparent employee communications has been critical. From the outset, I immediately started a regular cadence of communication with our employees globally. This included a daily executive leadership team meeting, a weekly global email message from me at the beginning of each week to all employees. And a live mid-week virtual Town Hall so that my executive leadership team and I can connect real-time with our teams around the globe.We also expanded our intranet, and equipped our leaders with tools to send short, personal video messages to their people. Over communication was and remains an imperative.As we shifted from office to home, we took our strong BeyondZero safety culture with us to create and maintain a safe working environment for our teams. As part of that, positive mental health is paramount, and we increased our offerings of mental health tools and techniques and mobilized our more than 1800 Jacobs Positive Mental Health Champions around the world.A certain portion of our business is essential and mission critical to governments and private sector clients where our staff continue to work on site. In these cases, we worked closely with our clients and established project-specific plans to ensure the safety of our people and the integrity of the operation.I have been so impressed with the success we have had in accelerating our digital transformation, investing in optimizing our networks and leveraging technology to facilitate collaboration and more flexible working scenarios for our people, while at the same time delivering on our commitments to our clients.Coming out of this pandemic we will have validated different work approaches, with less reliance on extensive travel and physical real estate, and with the potential for significantly reduced cost and carbon footprint. We are currently in the process of planning a safe return to our workplaces, how, when, and in some cases if, while at the same time advancing our strategy of our future of work. We will share more about this in our next earnings call.Early on during this pandemic, we leveraged our capabilities to become part of the COVID-19 solution. As our customers transitioned to remote working, we helped plan and execute those shifts, including support in assessment of cyber security implications.Materials and 3-D printing equipment were redeployed to help the frontline care workers with PPE. Existing federal and local government framework contracts around the globe were leveraged for action planning and implementation of healthcare facilities, including contracts for the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the Governments of U.K., Australia and New Zealand;Our Life Sciences teams were tapped for designing facilities that will ultimately produce COVID-19 vaccines or other therapies. And on the innovation side of the issue, we have two teams addressing different critical challenges. To better understand the spread of the Coronavirus, our teams are launching a pilot program to monitor wastewater streams using digital tools to help provide actionable COVID-19 insights and data to our clients.Our technologists are busy considering what it means for building owners when shelter in place orders are lifted and buildings that sat vacant for weeks or months may cause problems of their own such as legionella, lead contamination and poor air quality.Our teams have developed guidance for schools, offices and other public and private spaces to help them safely re-open and prepare for reentry. We believe that the positive impact on our culture over the past four years and our transparent and measured behaviors during this crisis has solidified loyalty with our employees, resulting in increased structural talent retention which will unlock more investment dollars for innovation and growth.As we turn to s6 to further discuss our business resiliency. As it relates to our people, we have purposely maintained our workforce capacity to position us strongly for a recovery after physical distancing subsides.By strategically aligning our portfolio to a diverse set of high value sectors such as; national security, water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, healthcare and life sciences, intelligent asset management, space exploration and the convergence of information and operational technology, we have significantly increased the durability and growth opportunities of our business under multiple economic scenarios and the expected new norm in the aftermath of COVID-19.In parallel with our portfolio transformation, we invested in digital technology to further expand our global integrated delivery model. This provides the ability to rapidly flex our deep technical expertise to accommodate any scenario around changes to global versus localized demand.Equally as important, we have created a powerful inclusive culture, which we believe unleashes the ability to execute more effectively versus our competitors when adjusting to changing market dynamics.From a financial standpoint this strategy has demonstrated strong results over the last few years and that track record of performance continued in our fiscal second quarter with pro forma backlog up 5% and pro forma net revenue up 7.5% year-over-year.Second quarter adjusted EBITDA also grew year-over-year and after a correction in the third quarter we expect it to improve in our fiscal fourth quarter. Equally as important and in-line with our previous outlook, we delivered positive free cash flow in the quarter and expect strong free cash flow for the remainder of the year.That the physical distancing constraints from COVID-19 have resulted in some near-term headwinds impacting the current third quarter as we and our customers adjust to a new working environment. However, we view these headwinds as temporary. As a result, we would expect the business to ramp up to run-rate levels over the next six-months as the structural drivers of our business are strong and our sales pipeline remains robust.We have proactively positioned our capacity to capitalize on this new normal environment by retaining talent and maintaining key investments. We believe these actions position Jacobs for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth in fiscal 2021.Finally, we have strong financial flexibility with ample liquidity that can be prudently deployed toward high return opportunities.Now I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Thanks, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook to account for the expected impact from COVID-19 on our business over the remainder of fiscal 2020 year.We are updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $950 million to $1.05 billion from our previous range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We are also updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, to a range of $4.80 to $5.30 from $5.30 to $5.80.At the mid-point of our revised EPS range, 2020 fiscal year adjusted EPS represents year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from fiscal 2020 and 2019 discrete tax items.Our revised guidance is based on an analysis of several scenarios that estimated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results. Specifically, physical distancing initiatives, which create temporary limitations on our clients' and Jacobs' ability to perform work primarily in the current fiscal Q3 period is the single biggest impact on these projections.The gross impact to EPS is estimated at approximately $1.50 at the midpoint of our estimates. Included in that estimate is approximately $100 million investment to retain talent, equivalent to approximately $0.50 per share. Importantly, we have strategically decided that we will maintain this talented workforce given our belief that we expect a rebound later this year, thereby ensuring access to this talent as we return to growth.We have taken significant actions to reduce this gross impact by reducing our cost structure, effectively reducing costs in the back half of the year by $1 of EPS. These efforts include elimination of discretionary, corporate, LOB and other employee related costs.As a result, our net expected impact at the midpoint of our range is $0.50 per share based on our decision to maintain our existing work force and to ensure that we have access to our talent to drive the expected return to growth. We believe it is a strategic imperative to retain our talented people across the company.We expect the majority of the earnings revision to occur in our third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate the impact of the pandemic on Jacobs to subside and our business to return to run-rate levels over the course of the fourth quarter.Importantly, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to improve with potential for year-over-year growth. As previously stated, we expect strong fiscal second half reported free cash flow of at least $400 million. And we believe that 2021 is shaping up for a strong rebound in growth. We'll provide an update as we approach the end of this fiscal year as we further evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator, we'll now open the call. Sure. Look I think all the work that we did over the last several years strategically is fortuitous, now as we go through this pandemic. When we did that work, we did a lot of strategic analysis on how this will make us a much more resilient company. And even though we're going through a temporary downturn, it's a result of something that you know, none of us ever predicted and that would be that we would be unable to physically go to work, our clients wouldn't be able to physically go to work, all that is gone through a correction.What we hear and see from our client based on our pipeline that's surging projects and programs that are not getting canceled, they're just moving to the right, that this resilient portfolio will continue to play out and gives us optionality as we move into fiscal 2021. There will be certain sectors amongst our portfolio, a very diverse portfolio that should be clear winners and others that you know, are going to be under pressure.And we're already in that transition of redeploying our workforces, going quickly our workforce to be able to address an attack that - those sectors that you mentioned, that should be big winners as we go into 2021.So you know, we're actually pretty positive about \u201821 and look forward to getting through this his current quarter. Hey, Mike. Yes. Well, again as I started to address that Michael in the first question. I think we're well positioned and what we believe we're going to be all the sort of critical missions and critical activities that are going to go on as we emerge from this COVID-19.And the Life Sciences business is a great example of one, you know, we're an industry leader there. That business has been a very global business and I think is - we believe now is going through a temporary transition to kind of reconfigure the whole supply chain and how to not only you know address the near-term opportunity of therapies and vaccines associated with COVID-19, but really to become more resilient in the event that this type of pandemic or something else happens which has created supply chain issues. And so these are initiatives that you know, we're in the mix on and we're well positioned to capitalize on that, no matter what the outcome is because of our global integrated delivery, our capabilities and our industry-leading position.And so, whether it's life sciences, healthcare, cybersecurity and of course, the critical missions that we do across our CMS business, which have been sort of on temporary hold are going to have to get at it, and we're positioned. You know, you think of the whole CARES Act, that whole CARES act that has supported our businesses to make our talent mission-ready for the essential critical work that's going to have to get done as soon as everyone gets back to work over the next several months. And so you know, there's a tremendous opportunity unfolding for us and we feel like we're well positioned. Yes. Well, I think we said it in our stated remarks that we're attributing 90% of the shortfall to this whole physical distancing limitation. So clearly, a key assumption you know and everything and we're talking about is that, that that's going to start to subside. Governments lift restrictions not only here in the U.S. of different city states, but across the globe.And that all takes place through the course of the remainder of this year. We're not assuming any accelerated basis but, that it gradually happens as - you know, as we're all starting to see. But it's going to happen throughout the third and fourth quarter. So that's you know, that's the major assumption. That's clearly not in our control.And so I think that's kind of a simple answer to your question as far as what's the key driver. Because once that happens I think that's the message we're trying to make sure that you all understand. This is a situation where the demand is sitting there and we just - we and our clients have to physically get back at it.So this is not a situation where projects have been cancelled and we're trying to rebuild the pipeline. We have a record high pipeline. Our backlog has grown. We just got to physically get back to work enough, not the way it used to be, but to a certain level recognizing that we probably as a company will continue to have remote working forever.Now that we've learned that in certain areas it's a more efficient, effective basis. But where we do need the face to face physical interactions and engagement with our clients. That's the key assumption around what we're talking about today. I don't have a exact percentage but I'd say it's been greater than it was in previous quarters. Yes, one thing I want to add here on top of what Bob talked about in addition to the size of the pipeline and everything that Bob talked about, as far as the pace is the margin in the pipeline is also improving. And we've got - you know, we've really upgraded our capability to measure and monitor this over the last 12 to 18 months.And as we look at that pipeline that Bob talked about compared to a year ago, the margin is a significant improvement, so which bodes well for our strategic goal of not only profitably growing, but increasing the margin of Jacob's. Well, let me start and then Bob maybe build on it. You started getting into an area that we're all watching closely is how, what's going to happen now on a state and local level because you know the government in the US has done a great job to really support the defense and civil you know, the federal side. And now what know we're looking anxiously, looking forward to seeing what they do with the next round of cares, hopefully in the next few weeks around state and local.And you know, there's a lot of positive news coming out that you know, I think everyone expects that they're going to provide relief to that sector. And so that should start to provide some good foundation as we enter 2021.And then the other piece is that, you know, there's a lot of discussion about, finally because this has been going on for years even pre-COVID is, the need for a big federal infrastructure stimulator to really get people going, putting the work, back to work around addressing the crisis across the nation on highways, bridges, a whole host of areas, you know, the need to continue to accelerate water and wastewater - and the whole broadband and everything else.So we're hoping and monitoring that and lobbying and very active on the hill to hopefully see later this year Congress could finally get at that that big infrastructure stimulus, whether that happens later this year or leaks into early next year, that's a real positive for Jacobs.And so you know, I think that's going to play a piece of what kind of momentum. If nothing happens and you know, there's a big vacuum on supporting the state local side. Yes, that could provide some headwinds over the next six plus months. But Bob... Jump back in the queue. Well, you know, I think the margin improvement is less about pricing and more about mix and the type of programs and projects we're strategically going after. So look, I think everything always has you know, a potential to be under pressure, under certain situations when you talk about margin.But I think we're confident in the margin profile improvement because it's been a strategic emphasis on driving a different approach on the type of things that we're going after and prioritizing you know, rather than as we started this transformation journey several years ago it was like let's just sort of go after everything that we can and it's much more of a strategic approach now, as we've you advanced the company, culture around strategy. So we would say that it's a pretty solid profile, less around macroeconomics and more about delivering on winning those new types of businesses. So the short answer Josh, is yes, we are seeing interest to expand our scope, talk specifically on the first part of your question with regards to the West sound contract in Washington with NASA. That's a really unique case. One, the team did a fantastic job on winning that with a differentiated solution and then keep in mind, we were awarded and had to mobilize in the midst of COVID. And we interviewed selected and mobilized folks all virtually and it was a true testament to our team and in CMS, led by Steve Arnett.. He did bit a - the team did a fantastic job at that.I think others are catching part especially when you talk about Mayport and specifically other NASA-type facilities. And so I think that differentiator of, yes, we can provide more value from the actual asset Intelligent Asset Management offering, but we don't need this prolonged, very in-depth and laborious mobilization plan in the means and methods and how we do it is going to lead to even greater growth. I might have to get back to you on that one. It's - you know, it's kind of weaved into a lot of our offering, but as far as giving you an exact number as a percent of the pipeline, I probably needed to follow up on that. We always we always have that Andrew, but ultimately not mature at all in the quarter. Yes. The new backlog from Wood was just over $400, about $4.25 million. And then what was the second part of the question. From KeyW I don't have that handy, but the stop period for Wood was very, very small, probably about $20 million or so. All right. So thanks everyone. Our transformation over the last 4 years as we just discussed during Q&A is been focused on building a strong culture and a portfolio which would prove resilient under multiple economic scenarios. Clearly COVID-19 is presenting a challenge that no one could not have predicted. But our transformation is proving to be the foundation that's going to help us see - us through this all \u2013 through this successfully. We are keeping our people safe, delivering on our commitments to our clients. We are also moving with swiftness and agility, shifting our work model to ensure business continuity and we're in the process of accelerating our digital transformation plan. And most importantly, we are retaining our most important asset, our talent to people. And so as we define how we're going to work in the future, we expect to benefit from significant cost savings, as well as further positive cultural benefits and the flexibility for our people and advancements in how we serve our clients. And that future starts now. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued to perform well with total backlog now $9.1 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis.Growth was driven by sizeable new business wins with the Navy to deliver intelligent asset management, and with the Air Force for research and development of rocket and propulsion technology, as well as two smaller but strategic wins for cyber assessment solutions for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and a develop and operations contract with the FBI's electronic laboratory. Overall, Q2 performance was in-line with our expectations for the business.As a part of the overall financial scenario planning for the company, we believe the crisis will have a short-term impact on our CMS business, with 90% of the temporary decline we are currently experiencing due to the impact of physical distancing associated with COVID-19.The underlying structural demand for our services remains strong and as a result we expect business to ramp up as we approach the end of our fiscal year and expect continued growth in fiscal \u201821 and beyond.Our CMS business is supported by long term, enterprise contracts. Unlike other parts of our CMS portfolio which can be executed virtually, these contracts involve highly technical work, such as Department of Energy remediation and Department of Defense test ranges, where access to the client's site is required. Some elements of these stable and resilient contracts are experiencing temporary impacts from physical distancing protocols.Let me now share with you further details on the impact by sector. Our US Federal Civilian business makes up approximately 40% of CMS revenue, with a majority coming from our NASA and DOE clients.Jacobs provides broad support to NASA in its accelerated work to meet the current Administration's mandate to return to the moon in 2024. Our client must make progress toward these national goals despite the challenges of teleworking and a reduced on-site workforce. At NASA we expect a low overall impact in the second half of the year as most of our work transitioned to teleworking or operating within physical distancing guidelines.However, we anticipate our DOE and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited nuclear contracts to be impacted to a greater degree in the second half of the year, as Jacobs teams are operating under physical distancing constraints that significantly decrease the on-site workforce.While DOE has provided us the ability to recoup the direct cost from the idle work force, our operating profit is generated on a performance incentive milestone basis. As a result, we expect to recognize revenue from these customers at a lower profitability until we ramp back to normal operating levels, which is expected later this fiscal year.I want to note that this part of our business continues to win awards in this tough environment. In April we were awarded a 39-month extension of DOE's West Valley Demonstration Project. West Valley is just one of the five extensions we have recently been awarded for our ten project sites.In the event of a continuing economic slowdown our nuclear remediation will be one of the most resilient components of our portfolio given the well-funded long-term recurring nature of the business.Now moving to the US Intelligence Community which contributes just over 20% of CMS revenue. Our Mission IT, C5ISR, and Cyber businesses provide solutions to this sector. Our clients in the Intelligence Community must continue to provide these critical services, remaining resilient in the face of increased cyber-attacks, and preserve continuity of operations, while responding to the sudden need to reduce on-site workforces.Overall, we see a moderate impact from physical distancing headwinds at sites that require split shifts in secured facilities. We expect the impact to dissipate as we approach the end of the fiscal year. This is partially offset by continued strong performance in our Cyber and Mission-IT business.Moving on, the US Department of Defense makes up approximately 20% of CMS revenue where we provide a wide range of mission critical services performed at government sites or in highly secure facilities. Our work at the Missile Defense Agency continues to operate at near normal run-rates, however much of our work at the army's test ranges have been impacted by physical distancing requirements.In line with our nuclear remediation business, these are highly resistant, well-funded, I am sorry, high resilient, well-funded long-term programs that perform well in economic uncertainty but require on-site execution by our employees. Similar to the intelligence community our cyber work within our DOD portfolio remains strong. We expect COVID-19 to have a moderate impact to our second half results within our Defense business but normalize as we approach the end of our fiscal year.CMS International makes up about 10% of the business, which covers primarily Tier-1 nuclear decommissioning, and operations and maintenance services in the U.K. and Europe. Our international business also supports the U.K. Ministry of Defence on its Continuous At-Sea Deterrence program, and various sustainment programs for air and land defense in the UK and Australia.We expect our International business to be moderately impacted from COVID-19 in the second half of the year with approximately 70% of the impact coming from field work interruptions and 30% from consulting delays, but returning to normalized run-rate as we exit the fiscal year.Shifting to our commercial business, this makes up approximately 10% of CMS revenues. In telecom, we provide solutions for wireless and wireline networks including the buildout of 5G. We expect this sector to remain strong over the next several years.For the automotive sector, we primarily design and operate aerodynamic wind tunnels and provide general technical services, engineering, and testing of automotive engines. This business is being temporarily impacted by physical distancing and we expect new awards to be delayed as our clients re-evaluate their CapEx portfolio and future demand requirements.In summary, we continue to believe the COVID-19 impact on our CMS business to be temporary and not indicative of how the business would perform in a typical recession scenario. We are aligned to high-priority, mission critical areas of federal government budgets and our overall 2021 sales pipeline remains robust at more than $37 billion. Of this figure, we currently have over $17 billion in source selection, with a blended profitability above our current run-rate.Moving to our People and Places Solutions Business on slide 8. Our P&PS business continued its strong track record of performance in the second quarter with backlog up 5.4%. Q2 net revenue, excluding pass-throughs, was up10% year-over-year. We had several wins in the quarter that further validate our strategy to align the business to a diverse set of high priority public and private sector initiatives in resilient geographies.A recent selection as the prime consultant for a major U.S. Navy Environmental contract, expected to be a $480 million in fee over 5 years, underscores Jacobs' proven program management, environmental and PFAS expertise. We also continue to drive technology-enabled solutions across all facets of the portfolio.As an example, we were awarded what will be the largest PFAS groundwater treatment pilot program in the U.S. with Orange County, CA, drawing on our multidisciplinary capabilities across all markets. And in our water business we won a 20-year O&M program for the City of Wilmington Delaware, which will leverage predictive analytics to optimize operations.In addition, we recently leveraged our deep domain expertise to win a software development contract for the U.K.'s national flood risk assessment and also won a mandate to deploy our AquaDNA software analytics solution at one of the world's largest water utilities.As evidenced by these superior client solutions, our strategic initiatives around global, market and digital connectivity are the basis for our continued double-digit profit growth trajectory over the last 18-months.Now, I will discuss how we expect COVID-19 to impact our P&PS business from a geographic and industry sector standpoint. Before doing so, I'd like to discuss how we have not only adapted but optimized our delivery amidst COVID-19.Our distributed workforce has maintained business continuity, while generating accelerated opportunities for innovation. We continue to deliver world-class consultancy and design with the majority of staff working from home, while also utilizing video streaming, augmented reality, and other innovative techniques to perform site assessments, inspections and assist in equipment maintenance and plant operation, linking our experts globally to provide solutions in real-time. Our digitized project delivery platform has created increased efficiency and has enhanced our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions.Now to our buildings and infrastructure geographies, starting with the Americas, including our Federal business. This business comprises more than 50% of our P&PS net revenue. Going into the fiscal third quarter, I am sorry, going into third fiscal quarter of FY20, the Americas is one of our best performing regions with strong double-digit top and bottom-line growth across multiple sub-geographies and sectors.We continue to see healthy sales bookings activity even considering COVID-19 pressures, with some delays in new awards, but minimal cancellations at this point. However, our revenue burn rate is expected to decrease modestly in the second half.We are strategically maintaining a slightly higher cost structure, in retaining our talent in anticipation of a return to a more normalized demand level and potential U.S. infrastructure stimulus. Overall, we expect the Americas to experience a minimal COVID-19-based impact year-over-year, but a more pronounced impact compared to our growth expectations. Forward looking indicators imply improved conditions as we approach our fiscal year end.Turning to Europe and the Middle East, this geography represents approximately 20% of P&PS net revenue, with the U.K. making up the majority of the business. Prior to COVID-19 the U.K. was experiencing Brexit related slowdowns as the newly elected government was in the process of formalizing their plan for increased infrastructure investment and restarting major programs which were awaiting funding.Through our diverse offering, track record of performance and scale, we are uniquely engaged in all major infrastructure programs in the U.K. In fact, we were just awarded a 10-year Highways England Smart Motorways Alliance contract. High-Speed 2 is also moving forward, along with a pipeline of smaller projects within existing framework agreements. However, we are cautious on our near-term expectations for a broader post-COVID-19 ramp up in this geography and expect a moderately negative impact to results in fiscal Q3, improving modestly during fiscal Q4.Longer-term, we view Europe and the Middle East as strategic geographies that will not only prioritize infrastructure spending but will also serve as an innovation hub for the latest digital infrastructure solutions.Moving to Asia, which represents just under 10% of P&PS net revenue with Australia and New Zealand comprising the majority of that business. While the pipeline of new opportunities remains robust, we are witnessing delays in some aviation related and other projects tied to government tax revenue associated with the downturn in commodities.We expect Asia to be materially impacted in fiscal Q3 2020 and improve as we reposition our resources targeting developing opportunities in healthcare facilities and transportation.And finally, our Advanced Facilities business, which makes up approximately 20% of P&PS net revenue, will likely see the most pronounced COVID-19-related impacts for the business in the short-term given physical distancing constraints at some of our sites.A key factor is our Life Sciences customers realigning their capital portfolio to COVID-19-related solutions and changes in supply chain strategies related to other therapies. We believe this business has the most potential for a sharp V-shaped recovery driven by multiple large scale COVID-19-related therapies and vaccine projects in the pipeline, where we are well positioned as the global leader.In fact, we are currently performing early conceptual designs for these life sciences and mission critical projects. In addition, cloud computing driven projects such as semiconductor fabs and data centers are likely to be awarded in the coming months.Our advanced facilities business is one of the areas we are the most optimistic about with the developing momentum we expect to play out over the course of 2021 and beyond.As we turn to our core sectors, while global restriction in mobility has resulted in reduced demand across all modes of transportation, much of the market's critical infrastructure projects have been sustained through recent government stimulus packages. We anticipate that future transportation-related stimulus will catalyze and drive economic recovery.Moving to the water and environmental sector, we are seeing strong long-term demand in both upgrades to water infrastructure and our utility operations and maintenance business. From an environmental standpoint our PFAS and FEMA-related businesses are expected to grow, partially offset from short-term impact from physical distancing in our field work and private sector environmental consulting.And in our built environment, which includes government facilities, healthcare, higher education, and smart cities, we anticipate near-term headwinds to be offset by solid demand in healthcare as clients rethink their evolving resiliency requirements.We also expect a growing demand from our higher-education and sports and entertainment clients reshaping their infrastructure preparedness for the threat of future pandemics.In summary, we have taken a proactive approach to assessing the shifting market trends into a living roadmap, we call the Now to Next initiative. This initiative, along with our proven track record of execution, reinforces our global, market and digital connectivity strategy.Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Kevin? Yes, Mike, I don't think we know the timeline. And so what we're doing in preparation of - instead of preparing for a world post-COVID, we're kind of preparing for a world with Covid and using technology is our friend. And so those physical distancing requirements, let's just take a field application and this applies to both CMNS, as well as PPS, we're developing - actually we have in-house technology around this with our ION platform where we're wearing bracelets that determine how far we are from each other, as well as contact tracing throughout the entirety of different sites or bases.So clearly it's a world that we're not anticipating and we look at our future projections. We're not putting a timeline on. Well, things are going to go back to the way they were on February 1st on X date. We're anticipating that it's going to be going longer. Yes. Steve, it's Bob. We actually see it as what's happening now, as a catalyst to even drive that strategy at a faster rate. What we've seen specifically in areas like Poland and India and Southeast Asia is - it is an incredible - an incredible level of efficiency as people go to remote and still operating in a design center capacity. And so I think that what's happening now is definitely going to serve as an accelerator for driving connected delivery and integrated delivery to another level.And then as we look forward to kind of the future of the workplace, we are going to have centers that require project collaboration with people in those centers. And so we're looking at layouts and workplace strategies that are unique by the different function of that operation or that office.And so a design center might have a different layout and say its a hub or a client site which might have more - I'm making this up, conference-based rather than workspace cubicles that are socially distance apart from each other.So we're right in the midst of all of that, it's part of that now to next kind of initiative, as we look forward in new markets and new ways of doing things from this dislocation. Yes. So, Gautam, this is Bob. So it is a bit of a different story between CMS and P&PS. And so let me kind of take them both separately. CMS, we see the - talked about it in the script. The pipeline is strong and the pace and velocity of our proposal activity probably hasn't been stronger. And so that has been a pretty strong cadence that it's only been a bit not stifled but slowed when we have those confidential or those secure proposals that we have. We can only do the proposal in a skiff and though we have skiffs within our real estate portfolio at times we have to use our clients as well. So say that strong and we see the award cycles not fundamentally shifting, so that pipeline remains very resilient.On P&PS, again as Steven and Kevin have mentioned before, this isn't a matter of cancellations, it's probably more a matter of some shifting of the pipeline. So we see that bookings target. We're still confident that we can be right on where we had projected, but we're tracking that week for week for potential slippages and most of that is coming from the fact that at our state and local business these are our clients that are probably getting more accustomed to - are becoming a little slower and getting accustomed to working from home then maybe we are.And so we're assisting our clients in the evaluation of these proposals. It's not that they're going away, it's just kind of the piece by which they could be reviewed and awarded.In our private sector business, it's actually been surprisingly resilient. And in fact, we've received some - just recent, can't disclose them, just recent awards from some of our larger private sector clients in the - from beginning to end through evaluation to award, all of those were done remotely. And so it's overall kind of a balanced approach there. We feel confident on this the - on the forecast. Yes. So it would maybe I'll also a bit talk about where we're positioned and we saw this you know in previous cycles as well. And I think it's actually even strengthened during this dislocation is the depth of intimacy we have with our clients. There was a previous question about what we can control and what we can't control.What we can't control is our ability to solve our client's deepest challenges and right now our clients are experiencing challenges that they've never even seen before. And with our, whether it be a framework agreement that we've had for decades and that's CMS and P&PS alike or you know newer clients that we're now getting into different types of solutions over providing.We're getting to a point where whenever it comes back and it might be a step change in one part of our business and more of a trend in the other part of our business. I would say that we are better positioned now to capitalize on that than we ever have been ever. And we have been in a good position in the past as well. So we're positive about that. Yes, because I think that there were tailwinds going into COVID, that COVID magnified. And so you know the commodity crisis though was exacerbated and effectively magnified as a result of everything that we've read about in the news, whether it be oil or gas or even in the metals commodities, COVID accelerated it to where now the need for government intervention was further accentuated.And so, I think the speed by which we're seeing government intervention in, whether it be in Singapore and Australia or New Zealand, it's faster and it's already happening. Hello? Next question. You need to get in there."

Finally, Steve will provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks, and then we'll open the call up to your questions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteven Demetriou: Thanks, Jon. Turning to Slide 4. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results and the progress we're making executing against our strategy. I continue to reinforce to our key stakeholders that we're on a journey to create a company like no other. Since 2015, we have been transforming our business to a technology-focused solutions company that leverages our global scale, deep technical expertise and now an enhanced brand. At the same time, we've revolutionized our company culture to align our people around one purpose, which is to challenge the accepted and reinvent our thinking to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. The growth opportunities within our core markets are more attractive today than any time in the company's history. We're benefiting from multiple multi-decade growth trends in the areas of water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, urbanization, space exploration, national security and 5G. These are all sectors where we have a distinct competitive advantage. Furthermore, I believe the changes we have made to our culture in the areas of diversity of thought and creating an inclusive environment are in the early phases of being a competitive advantage for Jacobs.From a financial standpoint, we posted a strong start to fiscal 2020. Our backlog grew 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. First quarter adjusted EBITDA pro forma for the KeyW acquisition was up 25%, and adjusted EPS, when excluding the impact of a $0.06 per share discrete tax charge, grew 35%. First quarter free cash flow is in line with our expectations. And we expect strong free cash flow generation for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and beyond as we approach the end of our restructuring efforts related to the strategic actions to transform our business. Discipline around optimizing working capital is a significant focus of our team.From a flexibility standpoint, we maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides the optionality on how we further deploy capital towards high-return investments. We're announcing today an increase to our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion, which is incremental to the remaining $400 million under our prior buyback authorization.Moving to Slide 5. As we continue to transform our business, sustainability is a key ingredient in our vision to become a company like no other. And it aligns squarely with our value of, we do things right, planning beyond our Jacob sustainability strategy that is aligned to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, which was launched a year ago and provides us a great platform to explore the possibilities of reinventing tomorrow, whether it's through how we operate and how we serve our clients, or at home with our families or in the communities where we live and serve.Over the last 12 months, we demonstrated significant progress on that strategy. I want to highlight a couple of actions here. We signed the UN's Global Compact, which commits us to a principle-based approach to doing business in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption, all things that are already part of Jacobs' DNA and value system. We also published our first integrated annual report, reflecting the integral nature of our financials and our sustainability focus and our commitment to robustness and transparency of nonfinancial data. We're developing a Jacobs' climate action plan, which includes a commitment to achieving a net 0 carbon, with a focus on reducing the emissions associated with our business travel and from the facilities we own or operate.As part of our walking the talk is increasing our engagement and thought leadership, ranging from hosting of global sustainability calls with other leaders from government and industry, to participating in this year's World Economic Forum's annual meeting at Davos, where I became co-chair of the Infrastructure and Urban Development Committee, focusing on how the adoption of technology and digital investment in the infrastructure sector can improve productivity and help achieve net 0 carbon emissions to tackle the global climate emergency. And our teams are providing sustainable solutions for our clients around the globe. With projects like SuedLink wind and solar power transmission system in Germany, various high-speed rail projects that help decarbonize transport systems. And on the waterfront, in places like Miami Beach, we are leading the Rising Above climate change resiliency program to combat the impact of catastrophic flooding on infrastructure and business. We're also leveraging our proprietary technology like our flood cloud service for on-demand scenario modeling across all infrastructure types.Climate change is one of the most significant challenges our world is experiencing. And we at Jacobs are making a commitment to work towards solutions through our everyday actions as individuals as well as with our clients and communities.Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada, to discuss the performance of our 2 lines of business.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 6 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. Our Critical Mission Solutions pro forma backlog was up 4% from last year to $8.5 billion, and when accounting for the burn-off of the Hanford Central Plateau Remediation Contract, our CMS backlog increased by high single digits over prior year. The Department of Energy has not yet announced the winner of the Hanford Tank Closure Contract, which is a 10-year $13 billion opportunity.We had a strong first quarter of wins with our international portfolio where we were awarded several notable contracts in support of our nuclear, defense and commercial clients. We expect the momentum we are seeing in the U.K. will carry over to our Wood Group nuclear acquisition that is expected to close before the end of Q2.Moving to our U.S. government sectors, we are aligned to high-priority areas such as mission IT and modernization, space exploration and intelligence, cybersecurity and nuclear remediation, and the spending outlook within our targeted U.S. Federal DoD and related budget is growing in these areas. And on the domestic front, in addition to a solid first quarter, we've had a strong start to the second quarter with 2 large wins in the Department of Defense. One of these was an 8-year $225 million research and development contract for the Air Force; and the other is an 8-year $420 million win, which we'll formally announced in the next coming weeks.From a strategic standpoint, we believe our unique delivery model, which combines strong technical expertise, localized delivery and an efficient cost structure, affords us the ability to take share within targeted sectors while improving profitability to reach the targets we shared at last year's Investor Day. As an example of our highly technical capabilities, we're awarded a Mission Critical win at the Navy's conventional prompt strike test facility to design and develop next-generation testing equipment for air launch and underwater testing of hypersonic weapons systems. This type of strong technical expertise, combined with our track record of executing large enterprise contracts, such as those for the Missile Defense Agency and NASA, presents us with the opportunity to capture incremental, large multiyear awards that are slated for decision over the next 18 months.Moving on to KeyW space intelligence opportunity. We were recently awarded a new multimillion dollar satellite payload, risk reduction and technical maturation program. Due to the highly classified nature of the work, we cannot provide details on specific awards and timing of full rate production. We remain extremely positive on the pipeline of opportunities from multiple customers and expect it to translate into meaningful revenue over the next 12 months. In summary, we're pleased with Critical Mission Solutions performance. And as we look forward, our total pipeline is robust and now stands at a record high, representing a significant year-on-year increase.Now moving on to Slide 7. Our People & Places Solutions business continued to execute on our strategic plan and posted strong first quarter results, with backlog growing 8% year-over-year to $14.2 billion. Our People & Places Solutions business benefits from its alignment to a diversified set of industry sectors that are all seeing structural growth, such as water infrastructure, resiliency and autonomous and AI-driven mobility solutions. We are also seeing strong demand in advanced facilities that are creating the next-generation of semiconductors, biotechnology and cloud computing software. We continue to execute against our market, digital and global connectivity strategy, which allows us to capture higher-value opportunities by leveraging our deep domain expertise with our global integrated delivery centers, serving as a focal point for excellence and innovation at a global scale. As the digital economy matures, clients across our targeted sectors are seeking companies that can help them transform their business, automate operations and enhance operational capacity.Digital capabilities are becoming ingrained in our delivery model, allowing us to leverage those capabilities with domain expertise to sustain our position as an industry leader. For example, Jacobs has partnered with the key clients in the Middle East to develop their smart port expansion master plan, envisioned to expand the port and enhance conventional operations by migrating to automated operations through artificial intelligence and autonomous mobility.Another key part of our digital connectivity strategy is planning for where the market will be a decade from now, whereby advances in neuro network technology or machine intelligence will likely unlock exponential opportunities for us to productize our domain knowledge through software applications. Longer term, we envision a higher percentage of our revenue from technology-enabled solutions, which command higher recurring profitability.Today, we are incubating the first generation of these AI infrastructure solutions. Last quarter, we discussed a cloud-based AI algorithm to auto-score water infrastructure. Within our innovation incubator, we launched Pay V which is a software-as-a-service based asset management solution that optimize air field maintenance, unlocking significant CapEx savings and embedded carbon fit. I'm also excited to talk about a project that combines our expertise in PFAS and digital solutions. We have recently been awarded with projects by an agency in the U.K. to develop a digital risk screening tool to prioritize PFAS investigation of sources across England. These types of solutions can be applied across multiple infrastructure assets and are enhanced by our domain knowledge accumulated from decades of [indiscernible].In summary, we are excited about the near-term and long-term opportunities within our People & Places business, which has a robust sales line -- sales pipeline up more than 30% year-over-year.Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to switch to Slide 8, where I'll discuss a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. First quarter gross revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue, including KeyW, up 5%, with 7% growth coming from People & Places and 3% growth from Critical Missions. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 24%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower benefit-related costs. Lower benefit-related costs also reduced unallocated corporate expenses, which I will discuss later.Our adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue fell by 70 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points on a pro forma basis, including KeyW to 15.3%. Again, indicating continued strong cost control and the realization of cost synergies from CH2M and KeyW.GAAP operating profit was up 34% to $151 million and included $51 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges. And $35 million of other charges, consisting of $22 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $13 million of costs associated with the Worley transition services agreements, of which $12 million of those costs were reimbursed and reported in other income. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $237 million, up 28% from the prior year.Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 8.9%, up 120 basis points year-over-year reported with margin expansion from both lines of business. I'll discuss the underlying drivers by line of business later in my remarks. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $260 million, reaching nearly 10% of net revenue, up 150 basis points year-over-year. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were up substantially to $179 million and $1.33 per share, and included $0.30 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges, as noted above; and a net positive $0.43 per share of other adjustments, consisting mainly of favorable mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake and other ECR-related matters of $0.56, partially offset by intangible amortization of $0.12. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.20, including a $0.06 expense from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year-ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was up 35% year-over-year.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. We are pleased that our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was above 1x for Q1 despite the Hanford plateau contract coming to end of life. We expect that strong bookings trajectory for the remainder of the year.Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 9, and starting with Critical Missions. Pro forma revenue, including KeyW, grew 3% year-over-year during the first quarter. The quarter was impacted by lower procurement revenue, which also supported incremental margin improvement. Operating profit was $90 million and grew 25% year-over-year and in the mid-teens on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, supported by some project closeout pickups on a nuclear remediation project, and improved margin associated with the lower headwinds from procurement-related revenue noted earlier. In the second half of fiscal 2020, we expect operating profit margin to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our shift to higher-margin, fixed-price services contracts and a higher contribution from the recently acquired KeyW.Perhaps I can make a few comments regarding KeyW. The strategic logic for the acquisition and associated revenue synergies are continuing to indicate an accelerating growth profile later in 2020 and longer term. As we previously announced in October, we won the $40 million a year DC3 cyber contract. In addition, the KeyW mission IT business won a strategic $55 million contract renewal -- a year contract renewal. And as Bob mentioned earlier, the rapid solutions team won a multimillion dollar satellite payload contract. As such, we expect a ramp in revenue and EBITDA growth for the remainder of fiscal 2020.Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q1 net revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and operating profit was up 12%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.1% for the quarter, up 50 basis points from a year ago. The business is benefiting from its alignment to multiple secular growth trends, global scale and a track record of strong project execution and lower risk verticals. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $32 million for the quarter, down 30% year-over-year, supported by lower benefits-related costs, which I previously mentioned were a factor in our gross margin expansion. We remain focused on cost discipline. But as we have previously stated, we will proactively evaluate incremental investments that will support our digital and innovation journey. And as a result, for the remainder of the year, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be near the high end of the previous $25 million to $35 million per quarter guidepost.Finally, we started the year strong in adjusted EBITDA performance, reaching a level of $260 million for the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reaching nearly 10% of revenue for the quarter, up 150 basis points versus a year ago.So now turning to Slide 10, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Before discussing our most recent efforts, we are pleased that integration of the highly successful CH2M acquisition is largely complete, although some miscellaneous ongoing charges remain for the balance of the year. Cost synergies exceeded our expectations, and revenue synergies continued to deliver higher growth and are serving as a catalyst for our business transformation.Regarding the sale of ECR, to date, we have incurred $206 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect the majority of the remaining costs to be incurred by the end of the first half of our fiscal 2020.Regarding KeyW, as of the end of Q1, we effectively achieved the run rate of $15 million in cost synergies, which resulted in our spending $22 million of our estimated $25 million of costs to achieve. To date, we have incurred $13 million of transaction fees and other one-time acquisition-related costs.Finally, our acquisition of Wood's nuclear business remains on track to close in our fiscal Q2. We continue to expect $12 million in annual cost synergies and expect approximately $30 million of transaction costs and cost to achieve synergies.Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 11. During the quarter, free cash flow remained impacted by restructuring-related activities. Reported cash flow was negative $159 million, but improved $86 million versus the year-ago quarter. One should note that our cash flow is normally lighter in Q1 due to seasonality, and it continued to be impacted by approximately $50 million of restructuring and separation-related cash outflows, offset partially by insurance proceeds related to the newly filed settlement and an ECR working capital adjustment. DSOs did increase from Q4 2019 are up slightly year-over-year. We expect to significantly improve collections over the course of 2020 and still see ample opportunities below our DSO run rate over the next 2 years. As a result, for the full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be $450 million-plus, including the impact from cash outflows related to restructuring and separation costs, which we believe will approximate $150 million. Our cash flow will strengthen considerably over the balance of the year.We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $600 million and a gross debt level of $1.6 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA was well less than 1x.Regarding capital deployment, we announced today that we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion to a total of $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 10% of our market capitalization. We continue to believe that our shares are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, and we expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time. For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of approximately $134 million for fiscal year 2020, excluding additional share buybacks. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buyback activity going forward, and we'll provide an update on our quarterly earnings call relative to share count expectations in the future.Including the discrete charge in Q1, we now expect an effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2020, although we continue to believe our normalized tax rate is approximately 24%. given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was previously declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year ago.Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts on Slide 12.\nSteven Demetriou: Thank you, Kevin. I'm excited about the continued traction of our business transformation. We're seeing a strong inclusive culture developing across Jacobs. Our pipeline is increasing year-over-year with larger, higher-margin opportunities. And we're strategically leveraging our balance sheet, investing in ourselves through timely share backs, as well as disciplined and targeted M&A activities and strong growth sectors.We're maintaining our fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $1.05 -- sorry, $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which includes the net impact from other income and noncontrolling interest. We are also maintaining our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 17% year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from fiscal 2019 discrete tax items. In addition, our guidance also factors in approximately a 6-month benefit from the Wood acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of March.As Kevin outlined, the majority of our restructuring charges are coming to an end, and we are highly focused and confident on delivering strong free cash flow for the remaining 3 quarters of this fiscal year. In summary, we're continuing our discipline, intensity and focus around delivering on our profitable growth strategy and look forward to 2020 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Bob, you talked about the KeyW contract success you've had late. I'm wondering if you could just step back. I think prior to the acquisition, they had talked about around 14 opportunities, greater than $100 million in value, that they had expected to be awarded sometime in 2019. Can you just level set us on how many of those have been awarded? How many have maybe slipped? How many have you won? How many have you lost?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. So really, net-net, we're actually -- we've seen an increase in number of opportunities. So that 14 number that was disclosed last year, has actually grown to north of 20. And then the ins and outs, I'll just put it this way, we're winning more than we're not. But we're also kind of in a -- in an area where we have to consider time as well. The duration of these procurements are -- can be pretty long.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked about the sensor opportunity. I appreciate you can't talk about certain aspects of it. But just high level, can you talk about whether, at this point, the risk is more technical or budget in nature. You feel pretty good that this capability is going to work and perform the mission, it just needs to be funded. Or is there still a fair degree of technical risk ahead of you?\nSteven Demetriou: Now all these -- this is Steve, Joe. The rapid solutions side of the business is played out as we expected. There are multiple opportunities. Bob reported today that we had a major win in one of them around space intelligence. And these things go through different base gates for the government. And they're just proceeding on making sure they qualify their -- the winners. And obviously, we got a major qualification hurdle behind us, and we're on track for what the model was with regard to entering this space intelligence ISR businesses with the KeyW acquisition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company.\nJoshua Sullivan: Can you just give us some color on the backlog here? If you think about margins, you've had some higher value content start to come through. But if you think about margin growth going forward, is it going to be more driven by the type of work that's been won and is in backlog? Or do you see margin growth more from some of these restructuring activities, some operational improvements internally?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes, I think it's a combination of both. Clearly, you're seeing us become a more and more efficient company. Our G&A as a percent of revenue is clearly contributing to an improved operating profit margin, and we're seeing it across both businesses. But it's also just the transformation of our portfolio, and within the 2 lines of businesses, the work that we're winning. The pipeline is richer in margin. If you look at the Critical Mission Solutions business, it's not only the intelligent asset management and the continued journey of those government projects, but more IDIQ should -- the whole strategy to increase the mix of IDIQ contracts is going to be a margin enhancement. KeyW acquisition is a margin enhancement. When we look at the Wood acquisition compared to our base nuclear business, it's a margin enhancement. So there's a collection in Critical Mission Solutions. And then you have the same story on the People & Places business with regard to the type of projects and programs that we're pursuing and winning in our backlog, but more importantly, in the record pipeline that Bob talked about.\nJoshua Sullivan: Great. And then just the expectation for DSOs to improve pretty substantially throughout the year. Can you talk about what's driving that? What actions you guys are taking?\nKevin Berryman: Could you repeat the question, Josh?\nJoshua Sullivan: Sorry, just the expectation for DSOs to improve pretty substantially throughout the year. Can you talk about what's driving that? Or how that dynamic's going to work out throughout the rest of the remainder of the year?\nKevin Berryman: Yes, a couple of comments. First one is, Q1 tends to be a more challenged quarter on the metric regardless. But notwithstanding that, we're still not satisfied that we're at the levels that we need to be. And similar to last year when we initiated a pretty strong level of actions that were being taken relative to improve our collections over the course of the last three quarters of the year, we're doing exactly the same thing. And so we're focused with our project teams relative to executing against that. We feel comfortable that those teams have clarity and sight going forward as it relates to how to deliver some incremental improvements. And it will be important for us to deliver the cash flow dynamics that we've outlined for the full year. So we're confident that the team is on top of it. We have the task force team in place relative to focusing on those specific areas that we know that we can make some real positive and strong progress on. And so our expectation is we'll start to see that over the course of the next few quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Kevin, I guess, just one follow-up on the cash flow question. I think before, like the Analyst Day last year, you said a big DSO opportunity, I think, was on the CH2M health side. So I'm just wondering, is it acquisition or the legacy Jacobs? And then how do we think about the cadence of free cash flow for the year? Should we assume it's more back-end loaded versus should we start to see the improvement in the March quarter? And are there any sort of onetime items embedded in that north of $450 million to get us to the free cash flow number?And then second question, obviously, you guys announced this morning that you increased your authorization on your share repurchase, which I think the market liked. Is that a message sort of signaling with KeyW and with Wood, that maybe M&A is on the back burner right now, we focus more on sort of integrating those acquisitions and buying back stock.\nKevin Berryman: So several questions in that, Jamie. Let me make sure I try and cover them all. First one, on the pace of our cash flow, we do believe that we'll start to see some benefits in Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. So I think that the expectation is consistent with many other years that we have -- the expectation is we should start to see some improvement. So I wouldn't necessarily call it back-half-oriented. I think, clearly, on the $450 million we've identified that there is specific restructuring-related items approaching $150 million. That's included in that $450 million number. So if you were to exclude that, we'd be more along the lines of a $600 million number. So I think that addresses your question on the one-offs.Other than that, clearly, we're going to have to fund the Wood acquisition coming up here in the next couple of months. So that's a one-off. Not in free cash flow, obviously. But certainly, it's one of the uses of cash that we're going to have this year.And the last one, about the authorization and the current number of $1.4 billion what are the implications on potential acquisitions. Look, I think our pipeline of acquisitions continues to be relatively robust. I wouldn't say that we're out of that market by any stretch of the imagination. But by the incremental authorization of $1.4 billion, it's clear that we view that we're -- we have an opportunity to add value by executing against the incremental authorization. So I wouldn't preclude other potential transactions. But I think we're being thoughtful and disciplined in terms of our execution against the share buyback, and we will be opportunistic in that -- on that basis to ensure that we're adding shareholder value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: You had a nice uptick in CMS margin in the quarter. You said it might have been mostly lower procurement. But is KeyW beginning to have more of an impact on margin? Are these margins in CMS now sustainable? And then is KeyW still supposed to be about $75 million in EBITDA for the year?\nKevin Berryman: So first thing on the margin profile. Look, I think the numbers that we have and our expectation is that we will be able to say -- to see year-over-year margin improvement on the CMS business. And so that is ultimately the expectations that we've set for ourselves in the balance of the year for CMS. The team is working hard. Steve alluded to a lot of the things that are already happening relative to going after different contract types, which afford us an ability to have some incremental margin. So we do believe that there is an ability to continue to show some improvements in that margin versus the year-ago figures. So yes, on that.I would say on the KeyW, I think the $75 million, we never really talked about a $75 million number per se. We did talk about the ability of us to ramp up over the course of 2020. And I won't make a specific comment on what the number is, but I can tell you that with the developing pipeline and the new wins that are coming to the forefront, specifically on some of the opportunities that we're really excited about for KeyW, I think we're going to see some momentum in the back half of the year as those things come into the portfolio and we start to burn some of the revenue against that. So perhaps a little bit back-end -- more back-ended, but we're really excited nonetheless.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And Kevin, can I follow-up on the $600 million in cash flow in '20 in the sense that -- I think you've said this before, sort of mid-80% conversion on adjusted EPS. If I go out into '21, I know it's a long time away, but would you assume that really of the noise, or should I say the onetime items, are behind you for the most part, and you get conversion closer to the 100% average that Jacobs has done over the last many years?\nKevin Berryman: I think that as we've characterized to all of you, we believe that there is an opportunity for Jacobs to deliver a higher level of conversion on cash flow than certainly we did in 2019. But we all know that there was a lot going on in that particular year.The $150 million that we've talked about in terms of restructuring and onetime efforts, which are kind of tail-end of the substantive transformation that we've been executing against, certainly, are going to be reduced to a significant level by the end of, not only this year, but kind of more along the lines of our first half of the year. So look, we're not necessarily done per se, if, in fact, we are going to be talking about acquisitions, and we do think there's a strategic opportunity, there will obviously be some onetime costs. But I think we're talking in a more measured level versus what we've seen, historically speaking, because the transformation of the integration of CH and the exit of the ECR business were fundamentally large, transformative issues that we had to work through over the last couple of years all at the same time. So our idea -- our view and idea is that as we go forward, it's going to be a little more clear, a little bit more focused. And consequently, the one-off restructuring or opportunities associated with our growth initiatives will be more focused and less robust than what they have been in the past in terms of restructuring-related costs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.\nJeffrey Molinari: This is Jeff Molinari on for Gautam. So I got a couple of questions on CMS. How big is the current bid pipeline? And what is the dollar value for bids submitted that are waiting decision?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So our dollar pipeline is in excess of $35 billion right now, and about 1/4 of those have been submitted. Probably the better news is that, that is up almost fourfold from this time last year.\nJeffrey Molinari: Okay. And then what do you anticipate for the book-to-bill to be in the March Q? Do you think you can continue your streak above 1x?\nKevin Berryman: Look, it really -- it's tough to really forecast an exact book-to-bill. Obviously, given the pipeline that's been talked about, our expectation is our book-to-bill improves over the balance of the year with some of these very large opportunities. We feel very good about coming to fruition. So we don't -- won't quote a specific number, but we certainly expect that it'll be improving versus our Q1 numbers.\nJeffrey Molinari: Okay. And what percent of 2020 sales are up for recompete? Are there any chunky contracts worth calling out?\nRobert Pragada: Besides the one we've talked about quite a bit on the Hanford Tank Closure Contract, I think that's probably the one that we're obviously very focused in on.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. We have a new bid for the Hanford tank and we historically had the Central Plateau remediation contract, which is a rebid that's in the process of being protested.\nJeffrey Molinari: Okay. And then the last question is, I think you mentioned the guidance includes 6 months of Woods. Was that the case previously? Or I might have missed that.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Just a question on People & Places Solutions. You folks have had really steady, sustained growth, even though the end markets have been a bit choppy over the past couple of years. Can you just talk about where your win rates are today compared to historical levels? Is it -- are you having more success on the bids that you're submitting with a wider service offering? Or what would you attribute the sustained outperformance hereto when you think about it in terms of win rates and project selection?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, it's kind of all of you above, Jerry. So our win rate has dramatically gone up over the course, I'd call it, 24 months, and is north of 50% right now. Two ways of looking at it. One is that maybe we're not bidding enough work. That's not the case. But we're bidding in an area from a technical consulting and technical solutions area where our solution is differentiated. And so we attribute that to the win rate. On your other question with regards to the opportunities, we're actually seeing -- it's a pretty opportunity-rich environment right now across the globe. And so there's no shortage of activity from a bid as well as a win rate, and I think you're seeing it in the lagging indicators with regards to the financials.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And then a question on the balance sheet, Kevin. So unbilled receivables plus contract assets were up $70 million sequentially in the first quarter. They were up $200 million last year. Is that just working through contracts from businesses that were acquired? Or can you give us some more context? Because clearly, based on the guidance, you're going to convert that into cash over the balance of the year. I'm wondering if you just build our comfort level on how concentrated that is and what's that related to.\nKevin Berryman: Yes, there's a couple larger contracts where it can be a little bit lumpy as it relates to how those things come to fruition. We're confident that given that lumpiness, some of that lumpiness will reverse over the course of the next couple of quarters, specifically. So we're feeling pretty good about it. And that's one of the reasons that we're pretty excited about the balance of the year cash flow. And so at the end of the day, we're on it. We're focused. And the team is -- I'm confident is going to execute against it.\nJerry Revich: And Kevin, what are the milestones? And are the projects on time so far? Any additional color that you can share?\nRobert Pragada: Sorry, Jerry, milestones with regards to those potentially what we got, is that what you're referring to?\nJerry Revich: Yes. So in other words, when can we change unbilled receivables or contract assets into billed receivables and eventually collect cash. So what are the milestone dates that we have to complete on those contracts to be able to issue the invoice, if you will?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. And so it's right in line with what Kevin said, it's within the next couple of quarters. So that improvement that we're seeing over Q2, Q3 and the balance of the year, those milestones fit right within that time frame.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Steve, in your -- in your prepared remarks, you talked quite a bit about climate change. And I think most people have been noticing, at least I had, over the last several months, even weeks, a lot more visibility, a lot more concern, a lot more companies talking about it. Can you -- is it more from a government standpoint? Are you having your private client customers engaging on these solutions? And in PPS, when do you think we'll start to see noticeable like wins or announcements that will start to drive -- I'm sure this is better margin, but better work through that segment?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes. So just use the World Economic Forum at Davos just in the last couple of weeks as a barometer. It was clear that it was across all sectors. Government sectors, the politicians that are there, the commercial CEOs, on a global basis. It felt like coming out of this at Davos, that there was a huge shift, and this is something that we got to carefully look at over the next several years to a crisis that everybody's on top of and committed to. So I think it's transitioned now to be a major issue and opportunity for us at Jacobs. We're developing our own plan to be at net 0 carbon neutral at some point in the future. And more importantly, we're already winning business, and we're already in the mix of being a solutions player on a global basis. We announced over the last year, 1.5 years, projects like the Miami Beach sea level rise, what we're doing in London around the Thames River. And you name it, any major city, whether it's San Francisco or all the way to Singapore, the type of things we're doing to address climate changes is we're viewed as a solutions provided by our clients.Clearly, higher-margin opportunities, and it's across the board. We're not only going in with traditional solutions, but we're going in with innovative solutions, using artificial intelligence and digital capabilities to address these issues in a much more efficient, innovative way. And as a result, we're -- we got a high win rate as we pursue these opportunities across the globe.\nMichael Dudas: And I assume that's for a lot of the internal investment, at least, that you talked about relative to 2020 beyond adding the talent and scope and solutions on that front?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, absolutely, Mike. We -- clearly, the human capital element is a big piece of that. If you look at our demographics right now, the age demographic probably stands out as -- I'd just say, in the last 10 years, that number has dropped by 10 years. And then from a technology standpoint, we're putting some real investment in simulation tools, whether they be simulation tools around flood plains and flood control, all the way to water resiliency and even coastal protection. We just were awarded, and I know this has been announced, the -- it's called Project Orange. It's the coastal restoration for the Gulf Coast starting in Galveston and going all the way through the Gulf of Mexico. And the technology that we're utilizing in order to build those solutions is really impressive. So more to follow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: If I could just circle back on your comments before, that you will still be in the M&A market. I mean, can you flesh that out a little more? You mentioned how your stock and the intrinsic value there. How are you seeing multiples moving in the pipeline, when we look at the defense and the people segment over the last few quarters?\nSteven Demetriou: Well, from an M&A standpoint, I think Kevin said it exactly right. Our first priority is our own stock. That's why we just announced the $1 billion stock buyback. We still see Jacobs as being one of the best, if not the best, use of our capital over the near term, based on what we see our organic runway and the path forward for the company.We're staying core to our strategic plan that we announced a year ago with regard to things like strengthening our capability and digital consulting, or selective geographic expansion, gaining more bolt-on capabilities around innovation and technology. And so the things like KeyW and Wood, most recently, were more in the form of bolt-on strategic enhancements to our ability to have upsized organic growth. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to be focused on over the near term. We have the luxury of being highly selective because of our ability to redeploy our capital against -- to Jacobs. And so any acquisition that we make over the next few years, it's going to be benchmarked against the alternative of buying our stock back, so it has to be superior value.\nMichael Feniger: Fair enough. And when we think of defense, in the private market, we've seen a lot of activity there to really drive scale. If we look at the design and consulting side for environment, water, transportation, how important is scale there in the industry? Obviously, CH2M has been a success. I'm just hoping you could talk about scale and how that benefits in that fragmented industry right there.\nRobert Pragada: The scale definitely helps and scale matters. But I would probably characterize it as a -- it's one of a few key criteria. It's not scale by itself, it's scale, coupled with technical expertise, coupled with technology-enabled solutions. And so we see all of that really as the driver, not scale-for-scale purposes.\nSteven Demetriou: I want to build on that because I think that's been a key ingredient to our success at Jacobs with our acquisition strategy. A lot of companies make acquisitions that double the size of an industry, but it's -- there's a lot of overlap. And as a result, there's all kinds of cultural disconnects that get created, and we've seen those around the industry for the last decade. CH2M was a perfect example of a complementary acquisition. Yes, it did give us scale, but more importantly, it kind of filled in the hole that we didn't have. So it was water, strengthening our environmental, our Tier 1 nuclear and a whole host of other things. And as a result, it was more of a diverse offering that gave our clients more of a one-stop shop at Jacobs that I would just put more in the area of value and diversity rather than scale group.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Just to continue on the last discussion topic there around scale. Of course, a lot of chatter recently around consolidation in the design and engineering space. I'd just be curious to get your sense on, from a competitive perspective, what the emergence of another kind of mega-player through a combination would mean competitively for Jacobs? Would there be potential threat there? Or on the flip side, potential opportunities emerging?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes, it really depends, again, on what that combination leads to. If it's a combination that two companies or two entities get together, and there's just a lot of overlap, that will be a positive for us. There'll be talent opportunities. There'll be disruption. There'll be culture challenges that impact those kind of acquisitions. Consolidation is also a positive from a standpoint that as industries get fewer competition, although stronger, there's positives out of that. So clearly, we're not saying that there's no threat of those type of combinations if they occur. But at the end of the day, our view is that it isn't about scale, it's about value, it's about differentiation, it's about matching that up with a culture of execution and innovation and accountability, all the things that we've been demonstrating over the last 4 years. And so we'll stay close to what happens out there in the industry, but it really depends on what that looks like.\nSean Eastman: Okay, that's helpful. And next one for me is just on this transition at the DOE Hanford site. It's come up a few times on the call today. I'm just curious, it seems like the tank's contractor selection process has been a little more protracted than expected. And I'm just wondering, given this is the one kind of big recompete this year, how we should be thinking about this plateau versus tanks dynamic and timing relative to what's built into the 2020 guidance?\nSteven Demetriou: Yes, I think there's not a lot of risk for us over the short-term in our guidance for Hanford. And for us, playing out so far, we'll see what the outcome is as we expected. As we said, in our previous calls that we did pursue both plateau and tanks, but we decided to be a sum or -- we didn't move into the prime position in plateau and really put all our efforts around teaming up with a great partner in pursuing tanks where we believe we could offer something unique and innovative to the client. And so as far as how it plays out, there is uncertainty of whether it's a month away or 6 months away. And I think that they're trying to finalize the plateau initiative. There's a protest going on in that initiative that probably has stalled tanks. Whether it's a 1-month stall or something that will be several months, we don't know, but we're not -- it's going to be immaterial to our 2020 results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank.\nChad Dillard: So you guys talked about going after different contract types and CMS, which would ultimately drive your margins upward. I just want to get a little bit more color on that. Can you talk about just what different capabilities you need? Are you potentially seeing new competitors in that new landscape? And just talk about the progress thus far on achieving that?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. Just before answering directly, just a little bit of a backdrop, and it kind of applies to M&A as well, but specifically on the contract type. If you remember, back in our Investor Day, this was a defined element of our strategy. And so the capabilities, in order to go up the value chain, coupled with the systems and project delivery know-how on how to deliver fixed price work, we have, and we've had for years. We're probably not as aggressive on converting what historically was cost-reimbursable-type work into fixed price task orders. And now, that initiative is in full force.From a competitive perspective, we're not alone. So the competition is also going down the same path. We're pretty confident that we have an edge in that because of the entirety of our business even beyond CMS into PPS, it's kind of embedded in our roots on how to deliver great projects. So but we're confident that this is something that's going to take hold. And like we said back -- last February, it's going to be about a 12 to 24 month period for us to get that as a material part of our portfolio, but we're on the right path.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And just a question on the quarter. Just in terms of the core free cash flow of the business. And I'm sorry if I missed it, you mentioned it earlier. Can you just talk about like what that was? And then hopefully, you can bridge that to what the actual headline number was. And then secondly, on CMS margins, I think there may have been a closeout. Any possibility of quantifying that would be great.\nKevin Berryman: We won't go into the details, but certainly, the -- taking your second question first. The margin pickup was a chunk of the incremental benefits we had. The idea, though, as it relates to what Bob was talking about in terms of the other margin improvement initiatives, we feel, are taking hold and gaining traction as it relates to the balance of the year. So that's perhaps that one.As it relates to the cash flow, cash flow is kind of in the neighborhood in Q1 of negative $150 million. And there was a couple of pluses and minuses in that number. So if you look at the headline number, our underlying was probably pretty close to the same number. Clearly, we had restructuring that was part of that, but we also had some benefits as it relates to ECR-related adjustments on working capital, which was a positive. And then we also had some insurance proceeds that was associated with the newly found matter. So at the end of the day, pretty close to being the same number. And I think that, that translates into us being able to leverage off of what that underlying number is, focused on ability to deliver incremental improvements and collections. And we're feeling pretty good about the balance of the year.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Andrew Wittman with Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: I'm going yield the floor. All of my questions have been asked and answered.\nOperator: Okay. And there are no further questions queued up at this time.\nSteven Demetriou: All right. Thank you. The most exciting part of where we are as a company is the momentum that we've generated by our people's belief and commitment in what we're doing and where we're headed. At the end of the day, we're a people business. To be the employer of choice in a highly competitive marketplace, genuine engagement and buy-in from our people is critical. Our focus on global challenges that are important to us as human beings as well as important to each and every one of our client is a key part of that engagement and commitment. The return is visible every day through the innovative solutions we're delivering for our clients. Our people really are reinvesting for tomorrow. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to switch to Slide 8, where I'll discuss a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. First quarter gross revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue, including KeyW, up 5%, with 7% growth coming from People & Places and 3% growth from Critical Missions. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 24%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower benefit-related costs. Lower benefit-related costs also reduced unallocated corporate expenses, which I will discuss later.Our adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue fell by 70 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points on a pro forma basis, including KeyW to 15.3%. Again, indicating continued strong cost control and the realization of cost synergies from CH2M and KeyW.GAAP operating profit was up 34% to $151 million and included $51 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges. And $35 million of other charges, consisting of $22 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $13 million of costs associated with the Worley transition services agreements, of which $12 million of those costs were reimbursed and reported in other income. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $237 million, up 28% from the prior year.Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 8.9%, up 120 basis points year-over-year reported with margin expansion from both lines of business. I'll discuss the underlying drivers by line of business later in my remarks. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $260 million, reaching nearly 10% of net revenue, up 150 basis points year-over-year. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were up substantially to $179 million and $1.33 per share, and included $0.30 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges, as noted above; and a net positive $0.43 per share of other adjustments, consisting mainly of favorable mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake and other ECR-related matters of $0.56, partially offset by intangible amortization of $0.12. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.20, including a $0.06 expense from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year-ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was up 35% year-over-year.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. We are pleased that our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was above 1x for Q1 despite the Hanford plateau contract coming to end of life. We expect that strong bookings trajectory for the remainder of the year.Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 9, and starting with Critical Missions. Pro forma revenue, including KeyW, grew 3% year-over-year during the first quarter. The quarter was impacted by lower procurement revenue, which also supported incremental margin improvement. Operating profit was $90 million and grew 25% year-over-year and in the mid-teens on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, supported by some project closeout pickups on a nuclear remediation project, and improved margin associated with the lower headwinds from procurement-related revenue noted earlier. In the second half of fiscal 2020, we expect operating profit margin to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our shift to higher-margin, fixed-price services contracts and a higher contribution from the recently acquired KeyW.Perhaps I can make a few comments regarding KeyW. The strategic logic for the acquisition and associated revenue synergies are continuing to indicate an accelerating growth profile later in 2020 and longer term. As we previously announced in October, we won the $40 million a year DC3 cyber contract. In addition, the KeyW mission IT business won a strategic $55 million contract renewal -- a year contract renewal. And as Bob mentioned earlier, the rapid solutions team won a multimillion dollar satellite payload contract. As such, we expect a ramp in revenue and EBITDA growth for the remainder of fiscal 2020.Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q1 net revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and operating profit was up 12%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.1% for the quarter, up 50 basis points from a year ago. The business is benefiting from its alignment to multiple secular growth trends, global scale and a track record of strong project execution and lower risk verticals. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $32 million for the quarter, down 30% year-over-year, supported by lower benefits-related costs, which I previously mentioned were a factor in our gross margin expansion. We remain focused on cost discipline. But as we have previously stated, we will proactively evaluate incremental investments that will support our digital and innovation journey. And as a result, for the remainder of the year, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be near the high end of the previous $25 million to $35 million per quarter guidepost.Finally, we started the year strong in adjusted EBITDA performance, reaching a level of $260 million for the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reaching nearly 10% of revenue for the quarter, up 150 basis points versus a year ago.So now turning to Slide 10, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Before discussing our most recent efforts, we are pleased that integration of the highly successful CH2M acquisition is largely complete, although some miscellaneous ongoing charges remain for the balance of the year. Cost synergies exceeded our expectations, and revenue synergies continued to deliver higher growth and are serving as a catalyst for our business transformation.Regarding the sale of ECR, to date, we have incurred $206 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect the majority of the remaining costs to be incurred by the end of the first half of our fiscal 2020.Regarding KeyW, as of the end of Q1, we effectively achieved the run rate of $15 million in cost synergies, which resulted in our spending $22 million of our estimated $25 million of costs to achieve. To date, we have incurred $13 million of transaction fees and other one-time acquisition-related costs.Finally, our acquisition of Wood's nuclear business remains on track to close in our fiscal Q2. We continue to expect $12 million in annual cost synergies and expect approximately $30 million of transaction costs and cost to achieve synergies.Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 11. During the quarter, free cash flow remained impacted by restructuring-related activities. Reported cash flow was negative $159 million, but improved $86 million versus the year-ago quarter. One should note that our cash flow is normally lighter in Q1 due to seasonality, and it continued to be impacted by approximately $50 million of restructuring and separation-related cash outflows, offset partially by insurance proceeds related to the newly filed settlement and an ECR working capital adjustment. DSOs did increase from Q4 2019 are up slightly year-over-year. We expect to significantly improve collections over the course of 2020 and still see ample opportunities below our DSO run rate over the next 2 years. As a result, for the full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be $450 million-plus, including the impact from cash outflows related to restructuring and separation costs, which we believe will approximate $150 million. Our cash flow will strengthen considerably over the balance of the year.We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $600 million and a gross debt level of $1.6 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA was well less than 1x.Regarding capital deployment, we announced today that we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion to a total of $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 10% of our market capitalization. We continue to believe that our shares are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, and we expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time. For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of approximately $134 million for fiscal year 2020, excluding additional share buybacks. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buyback activity going forward, and we'll provide an update on our quarterly earnings call relative to share count expectations in the future.Including the discrete charge in Q1, we now expect an effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2020, although we continue to believe our normalized tax rate is approximately 24%. given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was previously declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year ago.Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts on Slide 12. Could you repeat the question, Josh? Yes, a couple of comments. First one is, Q1 tends to be a more challenged quarter on the metric regardless. But notwithstanding that, we're still not satisfied that we're at the levels that we need to be. And similar to last year when we initiated a pretty strong level of actions that were being taken relative to improve our collections over the course of the last three quarters of the year, we're doing exactly the same thing. And so we're focused with our project teams relative to executing against that. We feel comfortable that those teams have clarity and sight going forward as it relates to how to deliver some incremental improvements. And it will be important for us to deliver the cash flow dynamics that we've outlined for the full year. So we're confident that the team is on top of it. We have the task force team in place relative to focusing on those specific areas that we know that we can make some real positive and strong progress on. And so our expectation is we'll start to see that over the course of the next few quarters. So several questions in that, Jamie. Let me make sure I try and cover them all. First one, on the pace of our cash flow, we do believe that we'll start to see some benefits in Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. So I think that the expectation is consistent with many other years that we have -- the expectation is we should start to see some improvement. So I wouldn't necessarily call it back-half-oriented. I think, clearly, on the $450 million we've identified that there is specific restructuring-related items approaching $150 million. That's included in that $450 million number. So if you were to exclude that, we'd be more along the lines of a $600 million number. So I think that addresses your question on the one-offs.Other than that, clearly, we're going to have to fund the Wood acquisition coming up here in the next couple of months. So that's a one-off. Not in free cash flow, obviously. But certainly, it's one of the uses of cash that we're going to have this year.And the last one, about the authorization and the current number of $1.4 billion what are the implications on potential acquisitions. Look, I think our pipeline of acquisitions continues to be relatively robust. I wouldn't say that we're out of that market by any stretch of the imagination. But by the incremental authorization of $1.4 billion, it's clear that we view that we're -- we have an opportunity to add value by executing against the incremental authorization. So I wouldn't preclude other potential transactions. But I think we're being thoughtful and disciplined in terms of our execution against the share buyback, and we will be opportunistic in that -- on that basis to ensure that we're adding shareholder value. So first thing on the margin profile. Look, I think the numbers that we have and our expectation is that we will be able to say -- to see year-over-year margin improvement on the CMS business. And so that is ultimately the expectations that we've set for ourselves in the balance of the year for CMS. The team is working hard. Steve alluded to a lot of the things that are already happening relative to going after different contract types, which afford us an ability to have some incremental margin. So we do believe that there is an ability to continue to show some improvements in that margin versus the year-ago figures. So yes, on that.I would say on the KeyW, I think the $75 million, we never really talked about a $75 million number per se. We did talk about the ability of us to ramp up over the course of 2020. And I won't make a specific comment on what the number is, but I can tell you that with the developing pipeline and the new wins that are coming to the forefront, specifically on some of the opportunities that we're really excited about for KeyW, I think we're going to see some momentum in the back half of the year as those things come into the portfolio and we start to burn some of the revenue against that. So perhaps a little bit back-end -- more back-ended, but we're really excited nonetheless. I think that as we've characterized to all of you, we believe that there is an opportunity for Jacobs to deliver a higher level of conversion on cash flow than certainly we did in 2019. But we all know that there was a lot going on in that particular year.The $150 million that we've talked about in terms of restructuring and onetime efforts, which are kind of tail-end of the substantive transformation that we've been executing against, certainly, are going to be reduced to a significant level by the end of, not only this year, but kind of more along the lines of our first half of the year. So look, we're not necessarily done per se, if, in fact, we are going to be talking about acquisitions, and we do think there's a strategic opportunity, there will obviously be some onetime costs. But I think we're talking in a more measured level versus what we've seen, historically speaking, because the transformation of the integration of CH and the exit of the ECR business were fundamentally large, transformative issues that we had to work through over the last couple of years all at the same time. So our idea -- our view and idea is that as we go forward, it's going to be a little more clear, a little bit more focused. And consequently, the one-off restructuring or opportunities associated with our growth initiatives will be more focused and less robust than what they have been in the past in terms of restructuring-related costs. Look, it really -- it's tough to really forecast an exact book-to-bill. Obviously, given the pipeline that's been talked about, our expectation is our book-to-bill improves over the balance of the year with some of these very large opportunities. We feel very good about coming to fruition. So we don't -- won't quote a specific number, but we certainly expect that it'll be improving versus our Q1 numbers. Yes. We have a new bid for the Hanford tank and we historically had the Central Plateau remediation contract, which is a rebid that's in the process of being protested. Yes. Yes. Yes, there's a couple larger contracts where it can be a little bit lumpy as it relates to how those things come to fruition. We're confident that given that lumpiness, some of that lumpiness will reverse over the course of the next couple of quarters, specifically. So we're feeling pretty good about it. And that's one of the reasons that we're pretty excited about the balance of the year cash flow. And so at the end of the day, we're on it. We're focused. And the team is -- I'm confident is going to execute against it. We won't go into the details, but certainly, the -- taking your second question first. The margin pickup was a chunk of the incremental benefits we had. The idea, though, as it relates to what Bob was talking about in terms of the other margin improvement initiatives, we feel, are taking hold and gaining traction as it relates to the balance of the year. So that's perhaps that one.As it relates to the cash flow, cash flow is kind of in the neighborhood in Q1 of negative $150 million. And there was a couple of pluses and minuses in that number. So if you look at the headline number, our underlying was probably pretty close to the same number. Clearly, we had restructuring that was part of that, but we also had some benefits as it relates to ECR-related adjustments on working capital, which was a positive. And then we also had some insurance proceeds that was associated with the newly found matter. So at the end of the day, pretty close to being the same number. And I think that, that translates into us being able to leverage off of what that underlying number is, focused on ability to deliver incremental improvements and collections. And we're feeling pretty good about the balance of the year."

            "name": "Steven Demetriou",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Turning to Slide 4. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results and the progress we're making executing against our strategy. I continue to reinforce to our key stakeholders that we're on a journey to create a company like no other. Since 2015, we have been transforming our business to a technology-focused solutions company that leverages our global scale, deep technical expertise and now an enhanced brand. At the same time, we've revolutionized our company culture to align our people around one purpose, which is to challenge the accepted and reinvent our thinking to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. The growth opportunities within our core markets are more attractive today than any time in the company's history. We're benefiting from multiple multi-decade growth trends in the areas of water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, urbanization, space exploration, national security and 5G. These are all sectors where we have a distinct competitive advantage. Furthermore, I believe the changes we have made to our culture in the areas of diversity of thought and creating an inclusive environment are in the early phases of being a competitive advantage for Jacobs.From a financial standpoint, we posted a strong start to fiscal 2020. Our backlog grew 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. First quarter adjusted EBITDA pro forma for the KeyW acquisition was up 25%, and adjusted EPS, when excluding the impact of a $0.06 per share discrete tax charge, grew 35%. First quarter free cash flow is in line with our expectations. And we expect strong free cash flow generation for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and beyond as we approach the end of our restructuring efforts related to the strategic actions to transform our business. Discipline around optimizing working capital is a significant focus of our team.From a flexibility standpoint, we maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides the optionality on how we further deploy capital towards high-return investments. We're announcing today an increase to our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion, which is incremental to the remaining $400 million under our prior buyback authorization.Moving to Slide 5. As we continue to transform our business, sustainability is a key ingredient in our vision to become a company like no other. And it aligns squarely with our value of, we do things right, planning beyond our Jacob sustainability strategy that is aligned to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, which was launched a year ago and provides us a great platform to explore the possibilities of reinventing tomorrow, whether it's through how we operate and how we serve our clients, or at home with our families or in the communities where we live and serve.Over the last 12 months, we demonstrated significant progress on that strategy. I want to highlight a couple of actions here. We signed the UN's Global Compact, which commits us to a principle-based approach to doing business in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption, all things that are already part of Jacobs' DNA and value system. We also published our first integrated annual report, reflecting the integral nature of our financials and our sustainability focus and our commitment to robustness and transparency of nonfinancial data. We're developing a Jacobs' climate action plan, which includes a commitment to achieving a net 0 carbon, with a focus on reducing the emissions associated with our business travel and from the facilities we own or operate.As part of our walking the talk is increasing our engagement and thought leadership, ranging from hosting of global sustainability calls with other leaders from government and industry, to participating in this year's World Economic Forum's annual meeting at Davos, where I became co-chair of the Infrastructure and Urban Development Committee, focusing on how the adoption of technology and digital investment in the infrastructure sector can improve productivity and help achieve net 0 carbon emissions to tackle the global climate emergency. And our teams are providing sustainable solutions for our clients around the globe. With projects like SuedLink wind and solar power transmission system in Germany, various high-speed rail projects that help decarbonize transport systems. And on the waterfront, in places like Miami Beach, we are leading the Rising Above climate change resiliency program to combat the impact of catastrophic flooding on infrastructure and business. We're also leveraging our proprietary technology like our flood cloud service for on-demand scenario modeling across all infrastructure types.Climate change is one of the most significant challenges our world is experiencing. And we at Jacobs are making a commitment to work towards solutions through our everyday actions as individuals as well as with our clients and communities.Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada, to discuss the performance of our 2 lines of business. Thank you, Kevin. I'm excited about the continued traction of our business transformation. We're seeing a strong inclusive culture developing across Jacobs. Our pipeline is increasing year-over-year with larger, higher-margin opportunities. And we're strategically leveraging our balance sheet, investing in ourselves through timely share backs, as well as disciplined and targeted M&A activities and strong growth sectors.We're maintaining our fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $1.05 -- sorry, $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which includes the net impact from other income and noncontrolling interest. We are also maintaining our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 17% year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from fiscal 2019 discrete tax items. In addition, our guidance also factors in approximately a 6-month benefit from the Wood acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of March.As Kevin outlined, the majority of our restructuring charges are coming to an end, and we are highly focused and confident on delivering strong free cash flow for the remaining 3 quarters of this fiscal year. In summary, we're continuing our discipline, intensity and focus around delivering on our profitable growth strategy and look forward to 2020 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Now all these -- this is Steve, Joe. The rapid solutions side of the business is played out as we expected. There are multiple opportunities. Bob reported today that we had a major win in one of them around space intelligence. And these things go through different base gates for the government. And they're just proceeding on making sure they qualify their -- the winners. And obviously, we got a major qualification hurdle behind us, and we're on track for what the model was with regard to entering this space intelligence ISR businesses with the KeyW acquisition. Yes, I think it's a combination of both. Clearly, you're seeing us become a more and more efficient company. Our G&A as a percent of revenue is clearly contributing to an improved operating profit margin, and we're seeing it across both businesses. But it's also just the transformation of our portfolio, and within the 2 lines of businesses, the work that we're winning. The pipeline is richer in margin. If you look at the Critical Mission Solutions business, it's not only the intelligent asset management and the continued journey of those government projects, but more IDIQ should -- the whole strategy to increase the mix of IDIQ contracts is going to be a margin enhancement. KeyW acquisition is a margin enhancement. When we look at the Wood acquisition compared to our base nuclear business, it's a margin enhancement. So there's a collection in Critical Mission Solutions. And then you have the same story on the People & Places business with regard to the type of projects and programs that we're pursuing and winning in our backlog, but more importantly, in the record pipeline that Bob talked about. Yes. So just use the World Economic Forum at Davos just in the last couple of weeks as a barometer. It was clear that it was across all sectors. Government sectors, the politicians that are there, the commercial CEOs, on a global basis. It felt like coming out of this at Davos, that there was a huge shift, and this is something that we got to carefully look at over the next several years to a crisis that everybody's on top of and committed to. So I think it's transitioned now to be a major issue and opportunity for us at Jacobs. We're developing our own plan to be at net 0 carbon neutral at some point in the future. And more importantly, we're already winning business, and we're already in the mix of being a solutions player on a global basis. We announced over the last year, 1.5 years, projects like the Miami Beach sea level rise, what we're doing in London around the Thames River. And you name it, any major city, whether it's San Francisco or all the way to Singapore, the type of things we're doing to address climate changes is we're viewed as a solutions provided by our clients.Clearly, higher-margin opportunities, and it's across the board. We're not only going in with traditional solutions, but we're going in with innovative solutions, using artificial intelligence and digital capabilities to address these issues in a much more efficient, innovative way. And as a result, we're -- we got a high win rate as we pursue these opportunities across the globe. Well, from an M&A standpoint, I think Kevin said it exactly right. Our first priority is our own stock. That's why we just announced the $1 billion stock buyback. We still see Jacobs as being one of the best, if not the best, use of our capital over the near term, based on what we see our organic runway and the path forward for the company.We're staying core to our strategic plan that we announced a year ago with regard to things like strengthening our capability and digital consulting, or selective geographic expansion, gaining more bolt-on capabilities around innovation and technology. And so the things like KeyW and Wood, most recently, were more in the form of bolt-on strategic enhancements to our ability to have upsized organic growth. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to be focused on over the near term. We have the luxury of being highly selective because of our ability to redeploy our capital against -- to Jacobs. And so any acquisition that we make over the next few years, it's going to be benchmarked against the alternative of buying our stock back, so it has to be superior value. I want to build on that because I think that's been a key ingredient to our success at Jacobs with our acquisition strategy. A lot of companies make acquisitions that double the size of an industry, but it's -- there's a lot of overlap. And as a result, there's all kinds of cultural disconnects that get created, and we've seen those around the industry for the last decade. CH2M was a perfect example of a complementary acquisition. Yes, it did give us scale, but more importantly, it kind of filled in the hole that we didn't have. So it was water, strengthening our environmental, our Tier 1 nuclear and a whole host of other things. And as a result, it was more of a diverse offering that gave our clients more of a one-stop shop at Jacobs that I would just put more in the area of value and diversity rather than scale group. Yes, it really depends, again, on what that combination leads to. If it's a combination that two companies or two entities get together, and there's just a lot of overlap, that will be a positive for us. There'll be talent opportunities. There'll be disruption. There'll be culture challenges that impact those kind of acquisitions. Consolidation is also a positive from a standpoint that as industries get fewer competition, although stronger, there's positives out of that. So clearly, we're not saying that there's no threat of those type of combinations if they occur. But at the end of the day, our view is that it isn't about scale, it's about value, it's about differentiation, it's about matching that up with a culture of execution and innovation and accountability, all the things that we've been demonstrating over the last 4 years. And so we'll stay close to what happens out there in the industry, but it really depends on what that looks like. Yes, I think there's not a lot of risk for us over the short-term in our guidance for Hanford. And for us, playing out so far, we'll see what the outcome is as we expected. As we said, in our previous calls that we did pursue both plateau and tanks, but we decided to be a sum or -- we didn't move into the prime position in plateau and really put all our efforts around teaming up with a great partner in pursuing tanks where we believe we could offer something unique and innovative to the client. And so as far as how it plays out, there is uncertainty of whether it's a month away or 6 months away. And I think that they're trying to finalize the plateau initiative. There's a protest going on in that initiative that probably has stalled tanks. Whether it's a 1-month stall or something that will be several months, we don't know, but we're not -- it's going to be immaterial to our 2020 results. All right. Thank you. The most exciting part of where we are as a company is the momentum that we've generated by our people's belief and commitment in what we're doing and where we're headed. At the end of the day, we're a people business. To be the employer of choice in a highly competitive marketplace, genuine engagement and buy-in from our people is critical. Our focus on global challenges that are important to us as human beings as well as important to each and every one of our client is a key part of that engagement and commitment. The return is visible every day through the innovative solutions we're delivering for our clients. Our people really are reinvesting for tomorrow. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 6 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. Our Critical Mission Solutions pro forma backlog was up 4% from last year to $8.5 billion, and when accounting for the burn-off of the Hanford Central Plateau Remediation Contract, our CMS backlog increased by high single digits over prior year. The Department of Energy has not yet announced the winner of the Hanford Tank Closure Contract, which is a 10-year $13 billion opportunity.We had a strong first quarter of wins with our international portfolio where we were awarded several notable contracts in support of our nuclear, defense and commercial clients. We expect the momentum we are seeing in the U.K. will carry over to our Wood Group nuclear acquisition that is expected to close before the end of Q2.Moving to our U.S. government sectors, we are aligned to high-priority areas such as mission IT and modernization, space exploration and intelligence, cybersecurity and nuclear remediation, and the spending outlook within our targeted U.S. Federal DoD and related budget is growing in these areas. And on the domestic front, in addition to a solid first quarter, we've had a strong start to the second quarter with 2 large wins in the Department of Defense. One of these was an 8-year $225 million research and development contract for the Air Force; and the other is an 8-year $420 million win, which we'll formally announced in the next coming weeks.From a strategic standpoint, we believe our unique delivery model, which combines strong technical expertise, localized delivery and an efficient cost structure, affords us the ability to take share within targeted sectors while improving profitability to reach the targets we shared at last year's Investor Day. As an example of our highly technical capabilities, we're awarded a Mission Critical win at the Navy's conventional prompt strike test facility to design and develop next-generation testing equipment for air launch and underwater testing of hypersonic weapons systems. This type of strong technical expertise, combined with our track record of executing large enterprise contracts, such as those for the Missile Defense Agency and NASA, presents us with the opportunity to capture incremental, large multiyear awards that are slated for decision over the next 18 months.Moving on to KeyW space intelligence opportunity. We were recently awarded a new multimillion dollar satellite payload, risk reduction and technical maturation program. Due to the highly classified nature of the work, we cannot provide details on specific awards and timing of full rate production. We remain extremely positive on the pipeline of opportunities from multiple customers and expect it to translate into meaningful revenue over the next 12 months. In summary, we're pleased with Critical Mission Solutions performance. And as we look forward, our total pipeline is robust and now stands at a record high, representing a significant year-on-year increase.Now moving on to Slide 7. Our People & Places Solutions business continued to execute on our strategic plan and posted strong first quarter results, with backlog growing 8% year-over-year to $14.2 billion. Our People & Places Solutions business benefits from its alignment to a diversified set of industry sectors that are all seeing structural growth, such as water infrastructure, resiliency and autonomous and AI-driven mobility solutions. We are also seeing strong demand in advanced facilities that are creating the next-generation of semiconductors, biotechnology and cloud computing software. We continue to execute against our market, digital and global connectivity strategy, which allows us to capture higher-value opportunities by leveraging our deep domain expertise with our global integrated delivery centers, serving as a focal point for excellence and innovation at a global scale. As the digital economy matures, clients across our targeted sectors are seeking companies that can help them transform their business, automate operations and enhance operational capacity.Digital capabilities are becoming ingrained in our delivery model, allowing us to leverage those capabilities with domain expertise to sustain our position as an industry leader. For example, Jacobs has partnered with the key clients in the Middle East to develop their smart port expansion master plan, envisioned to expand the port and enhance conventional operations by migrating to automated operations through artificial intelligence and autonomous mobility.Another key part of our digital connectivity strategy is planning for where the market will be a decade from now, whereby advances in neuro network technology or machine intelligence will likely unlock exponential opportunities for us to productize our domain knowledge through software applications. Longer term, we envision a higher percentage of our revenue from technology-enabled solutions, which command higher recurring profitability.Today, we are incubating the first generation of these AI infrastructure solutions. Last quarter, we discussed a cloud-based AI algorithm to auto-score water infrastructure. Within our innovation incubator, we launched Pay V which is a software-as-a-service based asset management solution that optimize air field maintenance, unlocking significant CapEx savings and embedded carbon fit. I'm also excited to talk about a project that combines our expertise in PFAS and digital solutions. We have recently been awarded with projects by an agency in the U.K. to develop a digital risk screening tool to prioritize PFAS investigation of sources across England. These types of solutions can be applied across multiple infrastructure assets and are enhanced by our domain knowledge accumulated from decades of [indiscernible].In summary, we are excited about the near-term and long-term opportunities within our People & Places business, which has a robust sales line -- sales pipeline up more than 30% year-over-year.Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail. Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. So really, net-net, we're actually -- we've seen an increase in number of opportunities. So that 14 number that was disclosed last year, has actually grown to north of 20. And then the ins and outs, I'll just put it this way, we're winning more than we're not. But we're also kind of in a -- in an area where we have to consider time as well. The duration of these procurements are -- can be pretty long. Yes. So our dollar pipeline is in excess of $35 billion right now, and about 1/4 of those have been submitted. Probably the better news is that, that is up almost fourfold from this time last year. Besides the one we've talked about quite a bit on the Hanford Tank Closure Contract, I think that's probably the one that we're obviously very focused in on. Yes, it's kind of all of you above, Jerry. So our win rate has dramatically gone up over the course, I'd call it, 24 months, and is north of 50% right now. Two ways of looking at it. One is that maybe we're not bidding enough work. That's not the case. But we're bidding in an area from a technical consulting and technical solutions area where our solution is differentiated. And so we attribute that to the win rate. On your other question with regards to the opportunities, we're actually seeing -- it's a pretty opportunity-rich environment right now across the globe. And so there's no shortage of activity from a bid as well as a win rate, and I think you're seeing it in the lagging indicators with regards to the financials. Sorry, Jerry, milestones with regards to those potentially what we got, is that what you're referring to? Yes. And so it's right in line with what Kevin said, it's within the next couple of quarters. So that improvement that we're seeing over Q2, Q3 and the balance of the year, those milestones fit right within that time frame. Yes, absolutely, Mike. We -- clearly, the human capital element is a big piece of that. If you look at our demographics right now, the age demographic probably stands out as -- I'd just say, in the last 10 years, that number has dropped by 10 years. And then from a technology standpoint, we're putting some real investment in simulation tools, whether they be simulation tools around flood plains and flood control, all the way to water resiliency and even coastal protection. We just were awarded, and I know this has been announced, the -- it's called Project Orange. It's the coastal restoration for the Gulf Coast starting in Galveston and going all the way through the Gulf of Mexico. And the technology that we're utilizing in order to build those solutions is really impressive. So more to follow. The scale definitely helps and scale matters. But I would probably characterize it as a -- it's one of a few key criteria. It's not scale by itself, it's scale, coupled with technical expertise, coupled with technology-enabled solutions. And so we see all of that really as the driver, not scale-for-scale purposes. Sure. Just before answering directly, just a little bit of a backdrop, and it kind of applies to M&A as well, but specifically on the contract type. If you remember, back in our Investor Day, this was a defined element of our strategy. And so the capabilities, in order to go up the value chain, coupled with the systems and project delivery know-how on how to deliver fixed price work, we have, and we've had for years. We're probably not as aggressive on converting what historically was cost-reimbursable-type work into fixed price task orders. And now, that initiative is in full force.From a competitive perspective, we're not alone. So the competition is also going down the same path. We're pretty confident that we have an edge in that because of the entirety of our business even beyond CMS into PPS, it's kind of embedded in our roots on how to deliver great projects. So but we're confident that this is something that's going to take hold. And like we said back -- last February, it's going to be about a 12 to 24 month period for us to get that as a material part of our portfolio, but we're on the right path."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Jacobs\u2019 Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jonathan Doros of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-K were filed this morning. And we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. During the presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, including the anticipated timing of the impact of the recently signed U.S. Infrastructure Bill, benefits of our strategic investments in PA Consulting and our financial outlook, among others. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included on slide two regarding these and other forward-looking statements. During this presentation, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to slide two of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results to prior periods on a pro forma basis. See slide two for more information on the calculation of these pro forma measures. For pro forma comparisons current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisition and the PA Consulting investment. We are also providing pro forma net revenue comparisons, which also exclude the impact of the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2020. Turning to the agenda on slide three. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Jacobs\u2019 Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and the future of ESG at Jacobs. Bob will then review our performance by line of business. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial results, followed by an update on our Focus 2023 and M&A initiatives, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide the detail on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we will open the call up for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we provided additional ESG-related information including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to slide four, before I review our results, I\u2019d like to share that we are in the final stages of completing our new strategy. We will be hosting an investor event the week of March 7th for a deep dive of the next phase of our Jacobs\u2019 transformation. Three key initiatives have emerged. First, we are putting in place a purpose-driven roadmap rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth. Secondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities, global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry. And third, we are taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem, while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and durable cash flow generation. We look forward to illuminating the strategy at our upcoming investor event. Now turning to our financial results, I am pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance, with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter and 18% for the full year. Backlog ended the fourth quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 41% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth, while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins up 24%. For the full year, PA revenue surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model. As we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week. And more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of their digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats. On top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth, driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life sciences priorities. Given these strong growth dynamics, we are introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Looking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025. Turning to slide five, as we reflect on climate change, it is globally accepted that humanity is at a critical juncture in our efforts to limit global warming. Jacobs and PA participated at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinvent tomorrow with immediate and sustained action in the transition to a net zero economy. We stood alongside other business, financial and government leaders, as well as activists and students to make sure our voice was heard. We engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory, while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change. As we move to slide six, given the nature of our business, it\u2019s clear that Jacobs\u2019 greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from a sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver in partnership with our clients. To spearhead this effort, we have established a new Office of Global Climate Response on ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies. We are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital, as well as ESG business transformation and alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Annually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years, driven by strong capability in energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship. Our culture is a competitive differentiator. Our people have the knowledge, curiosity and the trust of our clients to achieve our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. Moving on to slide seven, to review Critical Mission Solutions. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance. Total CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion, driven by our strategic new wins in cyber and intel, and nuclear and remediation. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security. Beginning with cyber and intelligence, we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security. First, cyber attacks on mission-critical infrastructure, which are even more stealth and as destructive as a traditional attack. Second, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, which requires real-time coordination between space and other domains as the severity of nation state sponsored attacks continues to increase. And third, the adoption of a data intensive AI-based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity. The funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY 2022, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year. Additionally, we expect the spending within classified budgets to be up higher. During the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million seven-year contract with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA\u2019s ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain imagery, including top secret data classification. And within the classified budget, we are awarded $170 million five-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning. We recently closed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Our strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community, as well as our Digital Enablement Center, will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue. We also recently announced a strategic investment and distribution agreement with HawkEye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF spectrum and analytics, and collection automation offering. Moving on to space, with a significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality, as well as other emerging opportunities such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris. Today, we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects. As commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for this emerging opportunity. During the quarter, we are notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in Marshall Space Flight Center that also supports Artemis and SLS. The U.S. Space Force selected Jacobs for a five-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur System, which coordinates the scheduling, training and status of U.S. Space Force aircraft. Finally, our telecom business has had a strong quarter and we see the roll out of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DirecTV, T-Mobile and Dish Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond. In addition, the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities. In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile. Now on to slide eight, I will discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We finished the year with strong financial performance with a year-over-year backlog growth of 7% and annual net revenue growth. I will discuss our results across the major themes of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digitization. Starting with climate response, as the top ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the effort to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advance transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters. This quarter, Jacobs was awarded a multiyear contract by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across Defense Department facilities. Jacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York\u2019s Rikers Island, taking the state through a full community revitalization with an equitable, resilient, multi-use approach incorporating our innovative social value analysis. As the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs\u2019 plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art 1 billion gallons per day water resource recovery facility that includes a renewable energy hub. In the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonized operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages. Our transit team continues to win contracts that support clients with assets, operational and technology shifts towards green fleets. For example, we recently won and commenced a hydrogen rail feasibility study with Caltrans, and our long-term work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting edge green transit solutions. With exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to firm to support leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally. We have doubled our EV book of business in the past year and are forecasting continued growth. We also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial suite electrification and infrastructure solutions, including a proprietary SaaS platform. The green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables, and our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients, from our participation in the Bacton Energy Hub consortium in the U.K., to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola\u2019s Renewables Avonlie Solar Farm and the Swanbank Waste Energy Facility in Australia. Moving on to the theme of pandemic response, with ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multi-year backlog across sectors with new wins in biopharma, such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility. Jacobs has successfully won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia, as they rethink pandemic response operations. The most significant aspect of the global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages. As the world\u2019s leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years. In fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers. Projects like Intel\u2019s new Arizona Fab, which is -- which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024. The new fab will manufacture Intel\u2019s most advanced process technologies and represent the largest private investment in Arizona\u2019s history. Interconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets. Globally we are continuing to win pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes. In highways, we were recently selected for transport to New South Wales along with consortium partners to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney Harbor. In ports and maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management for King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. And in air transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport and multimodal including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers. The program is of national significance. It will become the benchmark for zero carbon delivery and be a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe\u2019s future travel demand. Our longstanding relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. State Departments of Transportation and Transport for London, emphasizing our market-leading position for solving our client\u2019s most complex transportation challenges. In summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors. We are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year indicating that we are well-positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus. Turning to PA Consulting on slide nine. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations. Supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, PA\u2019s efforts have extended into a longer term vaccine deployment, testing trace and future pandemic-preparedness plan. Additionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy, and next-generation patient care model. We continue to progress our synergy growth and long-term collaboration. The Jacobs PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end life cycle solution, incorporating critical digitized clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout. Additionally, we continue to receive Joint Strategic Consultancy Awards in the transportation sector globally. I look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings to our customers. At COP26, PA displayed its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, ChargePoint. Further, PA gained and -- PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and Situational Intelligence tool with Unilever. The business exceeded current expectations -- current expansion targets for the year and is well-positioned for continued out year growth. I will now turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob, and good day to all listening on this call today. Turning to slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results followed by our fiscal year review. As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%. Fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places, CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%. We will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher value solutions for our clients. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burned both GAAP and our adjusted results. This charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement. GAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley Stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter. During the quarter, PA\u2019s continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion net of incremental interest. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3 times for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 2022. Now turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on slide 11. Gross revenue increased 4% and net revenue was up 7%. Including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year. We continue to enhance our portfolio to higher value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year. We expect mid single-digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year, driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and the ramp-up of new awards in our CMS business. GAAP operating profit was $688 million and was mainly impacted by the $261 million of purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and $150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.244 billion was up 18% year-over-year to 10.6% of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook. GAAP EPS was $3.12 and was impacted by a $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 of amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K. related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023 deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3ai equity stakes. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook. Of the $6.29 PA Consulting contributed $0.48 to that figure. Before turning to LOB performance, I would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. As a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect the potential non-cash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal 2022. Our new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to slide 12. Starting with CMS, Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis. Let me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting CMS revenue growth related to the transitioning off of two lower margin contracts. This represented $175 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract sign-off and adjusting for the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. In 2022 Q1, we expect to -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these two contract rollout -- roll-offs and this will phase out in Q2. As a result, we expected report -- we expect the reported revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, with underlying growth being much stronger. We expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid-to-high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate. Q4 CMS operating profit was $115 million, up 7%. Operating profit margin was strong up 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%. For the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20%, with 8.8% operating profit margin. The improvement for the quarter and the year in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities across the business. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range through fiscal 2022. Moving to People & Places, Q4 net revenue was flat year-over-year. When factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021. In Q4, total P&PS operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by the $20 million legal settlement costs I described earlier. Adding back on legal settlement costs, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4. For the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8% excluding the legal settlement. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q4 revenue grew 41% and 32% year-over-year in sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in sterling, with adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year. These costs were up year-over-year and in line with our expectation. This increase, excuse me, was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working. In fiscal 2022, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million given continued increases in medical costs and other investments. These corporate costs, as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022. In summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and EPS being relatively flat versus our Q4 results, with Q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year. Turning to slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The quarter\u2019s cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items, with $16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working. For the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter. Regardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income. For the whole year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above 1 times. As a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.19 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to adjusted -- expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we monetized our Worley Stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. We will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price given the strong long-term secular growth opportunities for our company. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I will turn it back over to Steve.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks, Kevin. We are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, which at the midpoint represents double-digit growth. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2022 is in the range of $6.85 to $7.45. We expect a multiyear benefit from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support our growth in the second half of fiscal 2022. As we look beyond this year, we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure modernization, climate response and digital transformation. We anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS in fiscal 2025. At our in-person investor event in March we will further expound on our long-term strategy and financial model. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator:  And your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Steve, as you built the portfolio, it\u2019s clearly been a focus to bring together green businesses and because of the idiosyncratic ESG scoring unfortunately, you folks aren\u2019t getting much credit for that, ESG funds are 80% underweight Jacobs. How does that impact the way you folks view the CMS portfolio or portions of the CMS portfolio going forward?\nSteve Demetriou: Well, look, there are some investors that are holding back because of some of our work which is really a very small portion, probably, less than 2% of our overall revenue that is really focused around what I would call critical national security for the U.S. Government and we are reaching out to those investors to try to explain that we are not involved in things like the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or whatever is holding them back. But I really think that as people understand sort of the fact that we are probably the largest public company delivering ESG climate change solutions out there that, as they see that ramping up and get more clarity, I think, we are going to attract a lot more investors that want to be part of the ESG story.\nJerry Revich: Just a clarification, is divestiture of that 2% on the table at all? How are you thinking about that within the portfolio context?\nSteve Demetriou: Look again, it\u2019s so small that we haven\u2019t really thought about that. But like anything else, Jerry, over the next few years, you will hear a little more about the stern strategy. We are going to continue to look at our portfolio and make sure we are aligned with all the right growth dynamics and I think we have proven that up to now we will continue to transform our portfolio in the right direction.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of The Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey. Good morning.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: I was curious if you could just give us some perspective just on global CapEx expectations into 2022. You guys have such a large global portfolio and touched so many different markets. From your view, what our customers generally planning for CapEx heading into 2022 as they look to move out of the pandemic?\nKevin Berryman: So, look, I think, there\u2019s a couple of things that we need to point out, specifically, the customers that Bob highlighted in the -- in his comments really about our advanced facilities, clearly very, very, very strong now. And the semiconductor shortage is acute and we have many of our clients that are looking to build significant capacities over the next several years. I do think our private clients ultimately are now all thinking more robustly about spend as it relates to environmental solutions and thinking about how they can transform their footprints in a way that are facilitating our ability to become a more sustainable global economy and I think that that\u2019s clear. And then I would augment that is with our government services side exactly the same comment. So I think that CapEx is very strong in that regard. The last piece I would call out is our environmental business and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well, where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that that will help them and then becoming a more viable, sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe. So I think you are right. There were wide -- we are focused across a wide swath and actually a lot of them, given the work we do are very, very strongly focused on these areas, which we think will encourage incremental CapEx longer term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Good morning. I guess first question the EPS target that you put out there for 2025, the $10, a support, obviously, good growth there. Kevin, can you just talk about, one, are there costs to achieve the $10 in terms of restructuring or investment? And then on the $10, can you provide some parameters sort of topline margins, do we need to utilize the balance sheet in terms of M&A or share repurchase to help achieve the $10? So, I guess, that\u2019s my first question. I will start there.\nKevin Berryman: Yeah. Jamie, thanks. Thanks for that. The $10 is really an organic number that we are alluding to and really doesn\u2019t involve capital deployment in any material fashion. And so, I think, clearly, there could be potential upside to those numbers, but we are working through all of that with our strategy, which we will talk more about in March, as Steve outlined. So, some of your questions are a little premature as we are finalizing all that work for margins and whatnot. Rest assured, I think, you can pretty much assume that the margin is not going down as it relates to what we are trying to get accomplished from an overall perspective. As it relates to cost to get there, look, we think that most of the things that we are going to be able to do are going to be embedded in our normal course operational expenditures. We did -- I did highlight the fact that we are working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint.\nJamie Cook: Yeah.\nKevin Berryman: We are expecting\u2026\nJamie Cook: Okay.\nKevin Berryman: \u2026 a potential impairment of 60 to 70, maybe up to 70 in the first half, maybe even in the first quarter. And then if I think about other things, there\u2019s not going to be significant moneys on top of that, maybe 25 to 50 in 2022, and then 2023 and beyond, TBD, I would say. And so we are really thinking that we like the portfolio and other than things that would occur relative to integration of acquisitions and deal costs and those kind of things probably somewhat de minimis in terms of restructuring costs outside of those.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.\nSteven Fisher: Great. Thanks. Good morning. One of the things I think the business and the stock really needs is kind of a breakout to the upside on the P&PS organic revenue growth and it seems like we started to see that this quarter. But, I think, Kevin, you said maybe 8% NSR growth, which is, I think, up from about 1.4% for the last couple of quarters. So maybe just more qualitatively to what extent are you really seeing a breakout on that P&PS growth now? So what\u2019s the organic assumption you have for the rest of fiscal 2022, because you give us some color on Q1 and what have you factored in there exactly for stimulus as part of that growth? Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: So let me take it, and then, Bob, you can add any commentary\u2026\nBob Pragada: Sure.\nKevin Berryman: \u2026 if you would like to.\nBob Pragada: Sure.\nKevin Berryman: Look, we are in this period of time in our Q1 and Q2 primarily where the numbers aren\u2019t really going to be impacted yet by the stimulus. We believe that\u2019s more a Q3 event. Maybe we get a little bit in Q2 but likely not and that is more Q3 and an acceleration into Q4 that we would expect the benefits associated with the stimulus and so we are excited about that. Having said all of that, I do believe our incremental growth going forward in Q1 and Q2 is going to be more solid than what we have been seeing over the last few quarters. And so we are starting to see some of that benefit of the advanced facilities, certainly not as much in Q1 but in Q2 and so I do think we will see some good solid growth in Q1 and Q2 on People & Places and then it will accelerate again, hopefully, into the Q3 and Q4 numbers. So we feel good about the developing momentum. I did make the comment that we are investing in front of that growth, too. So we are not going to see a lot of incremental margin associated with that because we are investing heavily.\nBob Pragada: Yeah. What I\u2019d add to that, Kevin, is that. Steve that the -- what\u2019s giving us optimism around there is our bookings. If we look at just what the way we started out the year from a bookings perspective, it\u2019s been solid. What the other part of that is that we have to think about the project life cycle. So these bookings are starting off with consultative services that are on the front end of some of these programs and projects and then they go through the subsequent phases where our services will escalate. So, overall, very good leading indicators that support what Kevin is saying.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nBob Pragada: Good morning.\nKevin Berryman: Hi.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Can you give us a little more color into what\u2019s going on in CMS? I think, Kevin you said that CMS margin would stay in the mid-8% range in FY 2022, but the margin had already risen to over 9% in the last quarter, despite still significant contribution from the lower margin contract work that\u2019s flowing through. Is there something else now impacting your margin in FY 2022? And then on the revenue side, your CMS backlog up double digits seems to suggest that you can deliver the mid-to-high single-digit guidance that you have, but you need to see an acceleration of awards and/or revenue burn, what you have been -- versus what you have been recording in Q4 to get there?\nKevin Berryman: So, CMS specifically, as you may recall, two years, three years, four years ago, when we did have these lower margin large contracts, we were in the 5% to 6% operating profit margin and we have now built over time that to the mid-8% number, which is great and it\u2019s consistent with our strategy. As we look about 2022 specifically, we will have ramp on some other lower margin business associated with Idaho and other nuclear remediation work. But that\u2019s not going to dampen our margin. It\u2019s just going to hold it flat for 2022, and then in 2023 and beyond, we started to see incremental margin above that as well. So it\u2019s a continuation of a long term margin play. It\u2019s just ebbs and flows when the big contracts come in, the margins associated with them. So 2022 is a little limited in terms of incremental margin and then we start to build again in 2023 and beyond.\nSteve Demetriou: So just for the, Operator, there\u2019s some background noise. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s your side that you are opening it up for questions. So could you double check that?\nOperator: Yes, sir. And your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard of Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys. So just wanted to dig into PPS, I think you got so many opportunities ahead, the climate change, semiconductor, infrastructure, digitization. How are you guys sizing the effects? Can you just like talk about the relative rank of the size of the opportunity and then just thinking through just where you guys stack up in terms of competitive dynamics in those specific segments?\nSteve Demetriou: Chad, can you repeat the front end -- the front part of that question again, it\u2019s a little broken.\nChad Dillard: Yeah. Sure. So, I was just saying, in PPS, it seems again just so many different opportunities ahead from climate change, the semis, infrastructure, digitalization and I just want to understand just how you guys are sizing the effects across all those opportunities, if you can talk about the relative rank in terms of the size of opportunity and your relative competitive positioning in those?\nSteve Demetriou: Sure. So as far as prioritization goes, I would say that, kind of, if you were to segregate into two buckets, one around climate change and the second round all those things that are creating the supply chain disruption. Those are the ones that are coming to priority right now. I\u2019d say on the climate change piece and this is where the portfolio optimization is really helping us. We are honing in on those areas that we have a sound market leadership and long-term client relationships, and where we can deliver immediate value. And those are squarely around transportation, water resiliency and in all of the environmental impacts that are affiliated with climate change. And so those client relationships that we have had have been pretty robust for several years and are supporting those opportunities. Around advanced facilities, this is a multi-decade type of leadership approach that we have had specifically in semis, but also in life sciences that, that\u2019s been a legacy business of ours forever. And so we are seeing those opportunities again not searching for them, these are long-term client relationships that we have had and we are kind of in the capital planning for those clients. And so it\u2019s really gaining share with long-term clients that\u2019s setting the priorities.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Hi, gentlemen. So I am just looking at the 2025 target. I think that implies around 12% earnings growth CAGR over the next couple of years. Seems like at the midpoint of the fiscal 2022 guidance, you are going to outpace that? And I just wanted to reconcile that considering the way you described the cadence of fiscal 2022 earnings, it seems like the exit velocity is going to be quite strong and that we should actually see accelerating earnings growth out of fiscal 2022? So I hope that question makes sense, just wanted to talk through the mechanics there, maybe there\u2019s some conservatism, ay commentary there would be helpful?\nKevin Berryman: Look, I think, what we do when we put forth our indications of what we expect our business to do, we think those are numbers that are obviously going to be able to be executed against. And so, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, and you are right, we will hopefully exit this year with a greater velocity than what we entered clearly and so we will see how that plays out. But I think, ultimately, what\u2019s clear is that we have got to, whether it\u2019s 12% or 11% or 13% or 14%, whatever it ends up being, we are going to have a long haul of good solid margin enhancing growth in front of us.\nSean Eastman: Okay.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, everybody. Maybe, Bob, you can share a little bit of your thoughts on your recent acquisitions and other opportunities in the pipeline from CMS, certainly increasing your cyber/intel higher margin business. But also on the PPS side, I know you put things out into your long-term guide on acquisitions. But how do you see that and is the company set to achieve these targets with the employees and professionals that you have and is there going to be some interesting opportunities to leverage some of that PA work as you get more collaborative to drive even further growth to serve the client base?\nBob Pragada: Hi, Michael. Let me unpack that here a bit. First, on the acquisition piece, we are excited. If you look at the last two that we did within CMS about a year ago with the Buffalo Group and most recently with BlackLynx, these are right down the -- right in the bull\u2019s eye of where we are going in cyber and intelligence. Where we are bringing in, whether it be client diversification with the Buffalo Group and higher end advisory services and that has played out extremely well. If you look at some of the, we have code names for them, but some of the wins that we have had over the course of the last nine months, that has played out perfectly. And then BlackLynx is getting us into those software solutions coupled with advisory services on automation and collection of data with processing engines that are working at the edge all around security. And so we are excited about both of those and coupled with long-term advisory platforms that we have had and the agencies that we are already in, that\u2019s going to serve us extremely well. With regard to prospects in the P&PS world, I targeted more towards it\u2019s not too dissimilar than our cyber and intelligence prospects around technology. We have got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we are talking about, coupled with now technology-enabled solutions is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy. So we are looking at the pipeline right now. It looks really good and more to follow on that front, as Steve mentioned, at the Investor Day. The employee base is something that we are acutely focused in on right now. This is where our globality really, really helps us, in that. We are in multiple locations around the world with high end talent that are delivering global talent utilized to deliver local solutions. And so, our ability to scale, you hear about some of the labor shortages that and labor topics that are -- that we are faced with in the western hemisphere, we are scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world and that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s been a big piece of ours. And then that last part with regards to PA, making a couple of collaborative opportunities. But where our -- where PA sits in, a lot of the same clients that we have in that C suite, as well as in kind of the front end of technology as our clients are developing new innovative ways of delivering the global topics, we are seeing the collaboration accelerate, and hopefully, we will have some more wins to talk about. The DEFRA win in the U.K. last quarter. This win -- can\u2019t disclose client in the biotechnology world. It\u2019s just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at this entirety of the life cycle of a project, to program or an issue is powerful and it\u2019s one that\u2019s picking up some significant momentum. So we are excited on all front.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the outstanding bids. I think you said $10 billion in source selection and just get a sense for, how -- what is sort of the phasing in terms of adjudication timeline, are you expecting a strong December quarter in terms of bookings? And just how does your -- how did the -- if you could talk to us about the continuing resolution and how that might change kind of the range of outcomes at CMS and relatedly recompete concentration over the next fiscal year, how much of the business basis up for rebid? Thank you.\nSteve Demetriou: Yeah. The -- look, we are pretty positive, confident that this whole continuing resolution, defense budgets, all that will play out over the next several months and get concluded. And we are expecting increase in the DoD budget and we are pretty positive about space and cyber and in the growth rates, especially in the classified work where we are significantly aligned too and hypersonic and telecom and we feel very well-positioned at places like NASA and how the budgets played out there. So really it is comes down to the whole timing question that you asked there. There has been some delay, very modest delay as the government clients are waiting just to see the outcome of this budget. And so as soon as that gets finalized, we see a few of these near-term prospects that we intended to unleash, whether that happens in December or the second quarter, I think, we are talking about sort of that kind of timing. So we are -- that\u2019s why we are very optimistic about the upward trend in CMS revenue growth as we move through 2022.\nKevin Berryman: Just a follow-up on your question on rebids. There is at the end of the year a couple larger rebids that we are going to have to be thinking through. But there\u2019s really no rebid risk embedded into the 2022 year assumptions.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, just so we are not missing anything here, to follow up on Sean\u2019s question, you guys just did the high end of your EPS range in 2021 and the midpoint is 14% growth. So just conceptually, with infrastructure ramping up, the CMS incrementals really taking off in 2023. Is there anything we should be aware of big picture of why earnings growth would not accelerate, why it would step down to 2025? Is there -- as you were kind of alluding to, is it recompete risk? Is it just higher level of SG&A or where the margins are? Just kind of help us understand, I know you will flesh out more at the Investor Day. Just when we see that $10 of EPS and the earnings growth you guys are getting this year, which is backend loaded, just the bridge there, just what are the things that would hold back that earnings growth?\nKevin Berryman: Well, look, we are talking 2025 here. That\u2019s four years from now. We are still in the midst of a pandemic and I think it\u2019s prudent to put some variability about what the world looks like four years from now. So I think the most powerful message about the $10 is we are putting that number out there even if economic situation is in not a good place in 2025. So, look, I think, it\u2019s prudent. Prudent to put out numbers that are appropriate and we feel like we can get after, and by the way, that\u2019s four years from now. So a lot can happen in four years.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, guys. Good morning, again. I just want to follow up on PA Consulting, because you recorded almost $0.50 of accretion in 2021. I think that\u2019s essentially double your original guide when you announced the deal. I know you probably don\u2019t want to tell us what\u2019s embedded exactly in FY 2022. We know what your original guy was there, but maybe you can give us color? And what has at PA exceeded your expectations by such a wide amount and what does that mean for Jacobs moving forward?\nSteve Demetriou: So that\u2019s a couple of things and maybe I will turn it over to Bob for any additional color. I think, Andy, the first thing is that, the acceleration in their growth, which is really the driver to what\u2019s been happening in 2022, a lot of it, a chunk of it is in related to that specific work Bob was alluding to on pandemic related and the work that they have been doing for the U.K. Government, really, really strong performance. Now they are -- as we look into 2022, they are going to be growing, but it\u2019s not going to be at that same rate that we have been talking about. They have got to figure out a way to recover and get new business to replace some of this business that\u2019s going to go away. So it\u2019s not a slam dunk as it relates to what\u2019s going to be happening in 2022 by any stretch. So having said all of that, what they have done in 2022 or 2021 has been extraordinarily strong, good margins and they have been executing well. And actually, the exciting thing is the collaboration between PA and People & Places and CMS is very strong and we are seeing that develop into longer term growth opportunities for maybe PA, but certainly Jacobs as well.\nBob Pragada: Maybe two areas that we knew about, we probably didn\u2019t fully give credit to the depth of the two things I am about to mention. One is the applied technology ability that they have. You see consulting firms that have kind of a roadmap or a recipe or a methodology that they utilize for different challenges and then proposing solutions. PA is applied, applied technology to solve a unique issue. And so that has really paid some dividends, especially with the new work. Kevin and I talked about the U.K. work, but this is now what we are seeing in the U.S. And then the second is around the depth of relationship. The depth of relationships that PA has and where to connect in the client organization and really hone that relationship through performance has been extremely impressive and is, again, we knew about it, it\u2019s exceeded our expectation.\nOperator: And there are no further questions.\nSteve Demetriou: Okay. Thank you very much. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good day to all listening on this call today. Turning to slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results followed by our fiscal year review. As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%. Fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places, CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%. We will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher value solutions for our clients. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burned both GAAP and our adjusted results. This charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement. GAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley Stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter. During the quarter, PA's continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion net of incremental interest. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3 times for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 2022. Now turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on slide 11. Gross revenue increased 4% and net revenue was up 7%. Including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year. We continue to enhance our portfolio to higher value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year. We expect mid single-digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year, driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and the ramp-up of new awards in our CMS business. GAAP operating profit was $688 million and was mainly impacted by the $261 million of purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and $150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.244 billion was up 18% year-over-year to 10.6% of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook. GAAP EPS was $3.12 and was impacted by a $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 of amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K. related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023 deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3ai equity stakes. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook. Of the $6.29 PA Consulting contributed $0.48 to that figure. Before turning to LOB performance, I would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. As a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect the potential non-cash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal 2022. Our new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to slide 12. Starting with CMS, Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis. Let me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting CMS revenue growth related to the transitioning off of two lower margin contracts. This represented $175 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract sign-off and adjusting for the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. In 2022 Q1, we expect to -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these two contract rollout -- roll-offs and this will phase out in Q2. As a result, we expected report -- we expect the reported revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, with underlying growth being much stronger. We expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid-to-high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate. Q4 CMS operating profit was $115 million, up 7%. Operating profit margin was strong up 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%. For the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20%, with 8.8% operating profit margin. The improvement for the quarter and the year in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities across the business. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range through fiscal 2022. Moving to People & Places, Q4 net revenue was flat year-over-year. When factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021. In Q4, total P&PS operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by the $20 million legal settlement costs I described earlier. Adding back on legal settlement costs, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4. For the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8% excluding the legal settlement. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q4 revenue grew 41% and 32% year-over-year in sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in sterling, with adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year. These costs were up year-over-year and in line with our expectation. This increase, excuse me, was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working. In fiscal 2022, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million given continued increases in medical costs and other investments. These corporate costs, as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022. In summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and EPS being relatively flat versus our Q4 results, with Q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year. Turning to slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The quarter's cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items, with $16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working. For the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter. Regardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income. For the whole year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above 1 times. As a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.19 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to adjusted -- expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we monetized our Worley Stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. We will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price given the strong long-term secular growth opportunities for our company. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I will turn it back over to Steve. So, look, I think, there's a couple of things that we need to point out, specifically, the customers that Bob highlighted in the -- in his comments really about our advanced facilities, clearly very, very, very strong now. And the semiconductor shortage is acute and we have many of our clients that are looking to build significant capacities over the next several years. I do think our private clients ultimately are now all thinking more robustly about spend as it relates to environmental solutions and thinking about how they can transform their footprints in a way that are facilitating our ability to become a more sustainable global economy and I think that that's clear. And then I would augment that is with our government services side exactly the same comment. So I think that CapEx is very strong in that regard. The last piece I would call out is our environmental business and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well, where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that that will help them and then becoming a more viable, sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe. So I think you are right. There were wide -- we are focused across a wide swath and actually a lot of them, given the work we do are very, very strongly focused on these areas, which we think will encourage incremental CapEx longer term. Yeah. Jamie, thanks. Thanks for that. The $10 is really an organic number that we are alluding to and really doesn't involve capital deployment in any material fashion. And so, I think, clearly, there could be potential upside to those numbers, but we are working through all of that with our strategy, which we will talk more about in March, as Steve outlined. So, some of your questions are a little premature as we are finalizing all that work for margins and whatnot. Rest assured, I think, you can pretty much assume that the margin is not going down as it relates to what we are trying to get accomplished from an overall perspective. As it relates to cost to get there, look, we think that most of the things that we are going to be able to do are going to be embedded in our normal course operational expenditures. We did -- I did highlight the fact that we are working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. We are expecting... ... a potential impairment of 60 to 70, maybe up to 70 in the first half, maybe even in the first quarter. And then if I think about other things, there's not going to be significant moneys on top of that, maybe 25 to 50 in 2022, and then 2023 and beyond, TBD, I would say. And so we are really thinking that we like the portfolio and other than things that would occur relative to integration of acquisitions and deal costs and those kind of things probably somewhat de minimis in terms of restructuring costs outside of those. So let me take it, and then, Bob, you can add any commentary... ... if you would like to. Look, we are in this period of time in our Q1 and Q2 primarily where the numbers aren't really going to be impacted yet by the stimulus. We believe that's more a Q3 event. Maybe we get a little bit in Q2 but likely not and that is more Q3 and an acceleration into Q4 that we would expect the benefits associated with the stimulus and so we are excited about that. Having said all of that, I do believe our incremental growth going forward in Q1 and Q2 is going to be more solid than what we have been seeing over the last few quarters. And so we are starting to see some of that benefit of the advanced facilities, certainly not as much in Q1 but in Q2 and so I do think we will see some good solid growth in Q1 and Q2 on People & Places and then it will accelerate again, hopefully, into the Q3 and Q4 numbers. So we feel good about the developing momentum. I did make the comment that we are investing in front of that growth, too. So we are not going to see a lot of incremental margin associated with that because we are investing heavily. Hi. So, CMS specifically, as you may recall, two years, three years, four years ago, when we did have these lower margin large contracts, we were in the 5% to 6% operating profit margin and we have now built over time that to the mid-8% number, which is great and it's consistent with our strategy. As we look about 2022 specifically, we will have ramp on some other lower margin business associated with Idaho and other nuclear remediation work. But that's not going to dampen our margin. It's just going to hold it flat for 2022, and then in 2023 and beyond, we started to see incremental margin above that as well. So it's a continuation of a long term margin play. It's just ebbs and flows when the big contracts come in, the margins associated with them. So 2022 is a little limited in terms of incremental margin and then we start to build again in 2023 and beyond. Look, I think, what we do when we put forth our indications of what we expect our business to do, we think those are numbers that are obviously going to be able to be executed against. And so, yeah, there's a lot of moving pieces, and you are right, we will hopefully exit this year with a greater velocity than what we entered clearly and so we will see how that plays out. But I think, ultimately, what's clear is that we have got to, whether it's 12% or 11% or 13% or 14%, whatever it ends up being, we are going to have a long haul of good solid margin enhancing growth in front of us. Just a follow-up on your question on rebids. There is at the end of the year a couple larger rebids that we are going to have to be thinking through. But there's really no rebid risk embedded into the 2022 year assumptions. Well, look, we are talking 2025 here. That's four years from now. We are still in the midst of a pandemic and I think it's prudent to put some variability about what the world looks like four years from now. So I think the most powerful message about the $10 is we are putting that number out there even if economic situation is in not a good place in 2025. So, look, I think, it's prudent. Prudent to put out numbers that are appropriate and we feel like we can get after, and by the way, that's four years from now. So a lot can happen in four years."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Moving on to slide seven, to review Critical Mission Solutions. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance. Total CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion, driven by our strategic new wins in cyber and intel, and nuclear and remediation. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security. Beginning with cyber and intelligence, we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security. First, cyber attacks on mission-critical infrastructure, which are even more stealth and as destructive as a traditional attack. Second, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, which requires real-time coordination between space and other domains as the severity of nation state sponsored attacks continues to increase. And third, the adoption of a data intensive AI-based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity. The funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY 2022, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year. Additionally, we expect the spending within classified budgets to be up higher. During the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million seven-year contract with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA's ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain imagery, including top secret data classification. And within the classified budget, we are awarded $170 million five-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning. We recently closed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Our strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community, as well as our Digital Enablement Center, will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue. We also recently announced a strategic investment and distribution agreement with HawkEye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF spectrum and analytics, and collection automation offering. Moving on to space, with a significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality, as well as other emerging opportunities such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris. Today, we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects. As commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for this emerging opportunity. During the quarter, we are notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in Marshall Space Flight Center that also supports Artemis and SLS. The U.S. Space Force selected Jacobs for a five-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur System, which coordinates the scheduling, training and status of U.S. Space Force aircraft. Finally, our telecom business has had a strong quarter and we see the roll out of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DirecTV, T-Mobile and Dish Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond. In addition, the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities. In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile. Now on to slide eight, I will discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We finished the year with strong financial performance with a year-over-year backlog growth of 7% and annual net revenue growth. I will discuss our results across the major themes of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digitization. Starting with climate response, as the top ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the effort to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advance transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters. This quarter, Jacobs was awarded a multiyear contract by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across Defense Department facilities. Jacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York's Rikers Island, taking the state through a full community revitalization with an equitable, resilient, multi-use approach incorporating our innovative social value analysis. As the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs' plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art 1 billion gallons per day water resource recovery facility that includes a renewable energy hub. In the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonized operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages. Our transit team continues to win contracts that support clients with assets, operational and technology shifts towards green fleets. For example, we recently won and commenced a hydrogen rail feasibility study with Caltrans, and our long-term work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting edge green transit solutions. With exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to firm to support leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally. We have doubled our EV book of business in the past year and are forecasting continued growth. We also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial suite electrification and infrastructure solutions, including a proprietary SaaS platform. The green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables, and our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients, from our participation in the Bacton Energy Hub consortium in the U.K., to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola's Renewables Avonlie Solar Farm and the Swanbank Waste Energy Facility in Australia. Moving on to the theme of pandemic response, with ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multi-year backlog across sectors with new wins in biopharma, such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility. Jacobs has successfully won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia, as they rethink pandemic response operations. The most significant aspect of the global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages. As the world's leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years. In fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers. Projects like Intel's new Arizona Fab, which is -- which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024. The new fab will manufacture Intel's most advanced process technologies and represent the largest private investment in Arizona's history. Interconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets. Globally we are continuing to win pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes. In highways, we were recently selected for transport to New South Wales along with consortium partners to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney Harbor. In ports and maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management for King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. And in air transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport and multimodal including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers. The program is of national significance. It will become the benchmark for zero carbon delivery and be a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe's future travel demand. Our longstanding relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. State Departments of Transportation and Transport for London, emphasizing our market-leading position for solving our client's most complex transportation challenges. In summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors. We are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year indicating that we are well-positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus. Turning to PA Consulting on slide nine. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations. Supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.'s National Health Service, PA's efforts have extended into a longer term vaccine deployment, testing trace and future pandemic-preparedness plan. Additionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy, and next-generation patient care model. We continue to progress our synergy growth and long-term collaboration. The Jacobs PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end life cycle solution, incorporating critical digitized clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout. Additionally, we continue to receive Joint Strategic Consultancy Awards in the transportation sector globally. I look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings to our customers. At COP26, PA displayed its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, ChargePoint. Further, PA gained and -- PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and Situational Intelligence tool with Unilever. The business exceeded current expectations -- current expansion targets for the year and is well-positioned for continued out year growth. I will now turn it over to Kevin. Sure. Sure. Yeah. What I'd add to that, Kevin, is that. Steve that the -- what's giving us optimism around there is our bookings. If we look at just what the way we started out the year from a bookings perspective, it's been solid. What the other part of that is that we have to think about the project life cycle. So these bookings are starting off with consultative services that are on the front end of some of these programs and projects and then they go through the subsequent phases where our services will escalate. So, overall, very good leading indicators that support what Kevin is saying. Good morning. Hi, Michael. Let me unpack that here a bit. First, on the acquisition piece, we are excited. If you look at the last two that we did within CMS about a year ago with the Buffalo Group and most recently with BlackLynx, these are right down the -- right in the bull's eye of where we are going in cyber and intelligence. Where we are bringing in, whether it be client diversification with the Buffalo Group and higher end advisory services and that has played out extremely well. If you look at some of the, we have code names for them, but some of the wins that we have had over the course of the last nine months, that has played out perfectly. And then BlackLynx is getting us into those software solutions coupled with advisory services on automation and collection of data with processing engines that are working at the edge all around security. And so we are excited about both of those and coupled with long-term advisory platforms that we have had and the agencies that we are already in, that's going to serve us extremely well. With regard to prospects in the P&PS world, I targeted more towards it's not too dissimilar than our cyber and intelligence prospects around technology. We have got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we are talking about, coupled with now technology-enabled solutions is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy. So we are looking at the pipeline right now. It looks really good and more to follow on that front, as Steve mentioned, at the Investor Day. The employee base is something that we are acutely focused in on right now. This is where our globality really, really helps us, in that. We are in multiple locations around the world with high end talent that are delivering global talent utilized to deliver local solutions. And so, our ability to scale, you hear about some of the labor shortages that and labor topics that are -- that we are faced with in the western hemisphere, we are scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world and that's a -- that's been a big piece of ours. And then that last part with regards to PA, making a couple of collaborative opportunities. But where our -- where PA sits in, a lot of the same clients that we have in that C suite, as well as in kind of the front end of technology as our clients are developing new innovative ways of delivering the global topics, we are seeing the collaboration accelerate, and hopefully, we will have some more wins to talk about. The DEFRA win in the U.K. last quarter. This win -- can't disclose client in the biotechnology world. It's just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at this entirety of the life cycle of a project, to program or an issue is powerful and it's one that's picking up some significant momentum. So we are excited on all front. Maybe two areas that we knew about, we probably didn't fully give credit to the depth of the two things I am about to mention. One is the applied technology ability that they have. You see consulting firms that have kind of a roadmap or a recipe or a methodology that they utilize for different challenges and then proposing solutions. PA is applied, applied technology to solve a unique issue. And so that has really paid some dividends, especially with the new work. Kevin and I talked about the U.K. work, but this is now what we are seeing in the U.S. And then the second is around the depth of relationship. The depth of relationships that PA has and where to connect in the client organization and really hone that relationship through performance has been extremely impressive and is, again, we knew about it, it's exceeded our expectation."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to slide four, before I review our results, I'd like to share that we are in the final stages of completing our new strategy. We will be hosting an investor event the week of March 7th for a deep dive of the next phase of our Jacobs' transformation. Three key initiatives have emerged. First, we are putting in place a purpose-driven roadmap rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth. Secondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities, global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry. And third, we are taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem, while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and durable cash flow generation. We look forward to illuminating the strategy at our upcoming investor event. Now turning to our financial results, I am pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance, with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter and 18% for the full year. Backlog ended the fourth quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 41% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth, while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins up 24%. For the full year, PA revenue surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model. As we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week. And more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of their digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats. On top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth, driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life sciences priorities. Given these strong growth dynamics, we are introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Looking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025. Turning to slide five, as we reflect on climate change, it is globally accepted that humanity is at a critical juncture in our efforts to limit global warming. Jacobs and PA participated at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinvent tomorrow with immediate and sustained action in the transition to a net zero economy. We stood alongside other business, financial and government leaders, as well as activists and students to make sure our voice was heard. We engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory, while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change. As we move to slide six, given the nature of our business, it's clear that Jacobs' greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from a sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver in partnership with our clients. To spearhead this effort, we have established a new Office of Global Climate Response on ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies. We are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital, as well as ESG business transformation and alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Annually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years, driven by strong capability in energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship. Our culture is a competitive differentiator. Our people have the knowledge, curiosity and the trust of our clients to achieve our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Thanks, Kevin. We are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, which at the midpoint represents double-digit growth. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2022 is in the range of $6.85 to $7.45. We expect a multiyear benefit from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support our growth in the second half of fiscal 2022. As we look beyond this year, we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure modernization, climate response and digital transformation. We anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS in fiscal 2025. At our in-person investor event in March we will further expound on our long-term strategy and financial model. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Good morning, Jerry. Well, look, there are some investors that are holding back because of some of our work which is really a very small portion, probably, less than 2% of our overall revenue that is really focused around what I would call critical national security for the U.S. Government and we are reaching out to those investors to try to explain that we are not involved in things like the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or whatever is holding them back. But I really think that as people understand sort of the fact that we are probably the largest public company delivering ESG climate change solutions out there that, as they see that ramping up and get more clarity, I think, we are going to attract a lot more investors that want to be part of the ESG story. Look again, it's so small that we haven't really thought about that. But like anything else, Jerry, over the next few years, you will hear a little more about the stern strategy. We are going to continue to look at our portfolio and make sure we are aligned with all the right growth dynamics and I think we have proven that up to now we will continue to transform our portfolio in the right direction. Good morning. Good morning. So just for the, Operator, there's some background noise. I don't know if it's your side that you are opening it up for questions. So could you double check that? Chad, can you repeat the front end -- the front part of that question again, it's a little broken. Sure. So as far as prioritization goes, I would say that, kind of, if you were to segregate into two buckets, one around climate change and the second round all those things that are creating the supply chain disruption. Those are the ones that are coming to priority right now. I'd say on the climate change piece and this is where the portfolio optimization is really helping us. We are honing in on those areas that we have a sound market leadership and long-term client relationships, and where we can deliver immediate value. And those are squarely around transportation, water resiliency and in all of the environmental impacts that are affiliated with climate change. And so those client relationships that we have had have been pretty robust for several years and are supporting those opportunities. Around advanced facilities, this is a multi-decade type of leadership approach that we have had specifically in semis, but also in life sciences that, that's been a legacy business of ours forever. And so we are seeing those opportunities again not searching for them, these are long-term client relationships that we have had and we are kind of in the capital planning for those clients. And so it's really gaining share with long-term clients that's setting the priorities. Yeah. The -- look, we are pretty positive, confident that this whole continuing resolution, defense budgets, all that will play out over the next several months and get concluded. And we are expecting increase in the DoD budget and we are pretty positive about space and cyber and in the growth rates, especially in the classified work where we are significantly aligned too and hypersonic and telecom and we feel very well-positioned at places like NASA and how the budgets played out there. So really it is comes down to the whole timing question that you asked there. There has been some delay, very modest delay as the government clients are waiting just to see the outcome of this budget. And so as soon as that gets finalized, we see a few of these near-term prospects that we intended to unleash, whether that happens in December or the second quarter, I think, we are talking about sort of that kind of timing. So we are -- that's why we are very optimistic about the upward trend in CMS revenue growth as we move through 2022. So that's a couple of things and maybe I will turn it over to Bob for any additional color. I think, Andy, the first thing is that, the acceleration in their growth, which is really the driver to what's been happening in 2022, a lot of it, a chunk of it is in related to that specific work Bob was alluding to on pandemic related and the work that they have been doing for the U.K. Government, really, really strong performance. Now they are -- as we look into 2022, they are going to be growing, but it's not going to be at that same rate that we have been talking about. They have got to figure out a way to recover and get new business to replace some of this business that's going to go away. So it's not a slam dunk as it relates to what's going to be happening in 2022 by any stretch. So having said all of that, what they have done in 2022 or 2021 has been extraordinarily strong, good margins and they have been executing well. And actually, the exciting thing is the collaboration between PA and People & Places and CMS is very strong and we are seeing that develop into longer term growth opportunities for maybe PA, but certainly Jacobs as well. Okay. Thank you very much. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter."

Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning. And we have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call.  During the presentation, we'll be in forward-looking statements, including with respect to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, potential government stimulus programs, expected benefits of our strategic investment in PA Consulting, our financial outlook, amongst others. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is included on Slide 2 regarding these and other forward-looking statements. During this presentation, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to Slide 2 of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results prior periods on a pro forma basis. See Slide 2 for more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics. For pro forma comparisons, current and prior periods include the results of the Wood Nuclear business, which closed in March of 2020 and the Buffalo Group, which closed in November of 2020 and the PA Consulting investment which closed in March 2021. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3, speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and the future ESG at Jacobs. Bob will then review our performance by line of business. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide a detailed updated outlook along with some of our closing remarks, and then we'll open the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation provides further ESG related information, including additional examples of our leading ESG solution. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: All right, thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year, 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4, before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we are developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy along with updated, multi-year financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. Turning to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro-forma basis. And our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation. Now that the award has cleared protest, when including Idaho, total Jacobs\u2019 reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a proforma basis for Idaho up 6%. Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year, 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super cycle in global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductors and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year, 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep, domain knowledge and investments in technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients\u2019 challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are, we do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. Building on our plan beyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG focused, digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high priority challenges like climate change and how they are creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives and throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions at action. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon neutral facilities as part of their journey to net zero emissions, an effort that may result at rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical times. And in the UK we\u2019re researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high growth business for Jacobs today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with via consulting Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detailed by line of business.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7, to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4 resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong, positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends in recent related wins in greater detail. Beginning with energy transition, progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cutoff CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global lifecycle nuclear capabilities. This includes advanced modular reactors or AMRs that can be used for electricity generation and for the \u2013 and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project that Idaho National Laboratory, as a majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a ten-year period and recently cleared protests. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the BOE, we will use Jacobs\u2019 technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the cold war, while delivering social value by supporting high quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Plain Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry. Moving on to space-based ISR, the U.S. Military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, out-think and outmaneuver bursaries across the multiple domains, land, sea, air, cyber, and increasingly space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR. And advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs has won a two-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to five times less than legacy space, radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added commercial, space-based AESAs. Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data, often collected from multiple sources, are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and of adversary activity, ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs\u2019 recent Buffalo Group acquisition won two attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902d Military Group CI Human Intelligence Analytical Services contract is a $234 million five-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM\u2019s, counter intelligence and counter terrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protests and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army\u2019s biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DirecTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G\u2019s higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities fueling growth in our telecom business. In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection, and importantly with an increasing margin profile. Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance driven by our strategy to focus on high value sectors in key geographic regions leveraging our strong global integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a one times book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure, modernization and digitalization, as well as accelerated supply chain demands and areas driven by the pandemic are catalyzing our clients\u2019 mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multi-year trends, align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business. Starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions, aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force in their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by Environment Analyst as the number one leader in water quality and resources. And our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base Coastal Resilience study in Florida, was recognized as a global winner at the UK Environment Agency\u2019s 2021 Flood & Coast awards. Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we're winning major projects around the globe, such as the east-west rail program partner in the UK, a major U.S. transit authority\u2019s, metro rail platform reconstruction and the KiwiRail monitorization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally enabled solutions. We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope launched today. Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients, and capital planning and maps that true risks, costs and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. As an example, for the healthcare sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real time, meteorological, traffic, and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with their clients to reinvent healthcare of tomorrow.  Shifting to our advanced facility sector. We believe we are entering an unprecedented multiyear growth cycle. In our electronic sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given the long-term demand in cloud and edge computing, data storage and smart infrastructure such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with a goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in this space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, new Greenfield Campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We have also secured a major contract with Nature Works to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand, dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including challenge from India and the Philippines. Finally, as it relates to pandemic driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again, combined our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We're performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent large revenue synergy in the UK that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs win the new UK Department of Food and Rural Affairs Management Consultancy contract, a large scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint research continued to be across other regions and geographies. And I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. As we looked at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the UK\u2019s government \u2013 UK government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model and in health and life sciences virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise and consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience, and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for TeakOrigin and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious iF design awards. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contribute to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn off two lower margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 at 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately eight percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, favorable revenue mix in both People & Places and CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year in line with our expectations to 17%. GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $15 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32% with both CMS and People & Places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth and operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago second. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share, and primarily included $0.44 related to an updated non-cash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares with no impact to the original consideration, $0.34 related to the UK statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate. $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles, all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% \u2013 by a 20% effective tax rate to reflect the change in our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder from modeling purposes, before we consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results with 35% minority interest backed out in non-controlling interest. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was one times for Q3 with actually a little bit higher book-to-bills of 1.1 on a gross margin level. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 2% pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off two lower margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff at FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million quarter of year-over-year impact from these two contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and our first quarter of fiscal 2022. CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year. And we expect mid single digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions, as well as benefits from the FX. While the Americas business saw near term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result and customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning on our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum when combined with the strength of our advanced facilities business noted earlier by Bob positions us well into 2022. Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year including [ph] the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $256 million in revenue and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22% in line with our expectations. Finally, our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate cost to also turn slightly higher in Q4 given continued increases in the medical costs, and other investments, as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges has significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. Comment quickly during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023, as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook. And we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. It is important to know this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million putting us on track for greater than one time adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we also monetized our investments C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and growth debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership, treating the Worley position as cash our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. Now let me turn it back over to Steve for Slide 13.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong year-to-date performance, excellent results from our PA Consulting investment and the benefit from the lower tax rate, we're raising our full year guidance. We now expect the adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.21 billion to $1.275 billion versus our previous outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.27 billion. We expect adjusted EPS to now be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35 per share versus our previous outlook of $6 to $6.30. Looking beyond fiscal 2021. The likelihood of U.S. infrastructure stimulus package has substantially increased over the last week, which has become a significant benefit to our Jacobs P&L in the second half of our fiscal year 2022 and beyond. With the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, we are aligned to strong secular growth trends, including global infrastructure modernization, climate change, national security, digital transformation, and global supply chain investments. As a result, we expect this to drive double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bob, can you just talk about the Space Intel contract a little bit. I think that was a competitive process, correct me if I'm wrong. And then can you remind us what the additional opportunities are going forward with that capability? And then Kevin, can you just level set kind of what the outflows are that are being excluded from the free cash flow conversion? Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Yes, Joe, good morning. On the Space Intelligence, it's really has to do with our some of the unique technologies around array technology. And we're not \u2013 I can't disclose the decline, but this is a multi-phase type project. And so we're on the front end of the development of that project. And so we see continued growth there. Just to add onto that, what we're also seeing with our SAR technology or the Synthetic Aperture Radar is the air-based component of what's coming out of our Rapid Solutions business. A couple of really nice wins confidential there again, early phases, but seeing the investment on that front.\nKevin Berryman: Joe just real quickly on the adjusted free cash flow that we talked about, there's two items effectively. The most material one is the $261 million of the compensation treated numbers associated with PA that was ultimately originally part of our consideration. But because of GAAP, we had to run it through the P&L that's 261, and we have another 19 of restructuring related matters which are just timing relative to the P&L. But you also heard me talked about, which was $2 million. Those two added together, take our reported free cash flow to the $430 plus million for the quarter. Really strong and we're very pleased with it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good afternoon guys, or good morning guys.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nBob Pragada: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Steve or Bob, I know you mentioned a potential super cycle and supply chain related build-out, which is your most bullish commentary yet regarding advanced facilities life sciences, as you mentioned, I think Bob you mentioned a sharp uptake in semiconductor activity, but as your advanced facilities business actually contributing meaningfully to P&PS growth yet. I know Bob last quarter you talked to better ramping up over a longer-term period. When do you think you can start to meaningfully contribute to quarterly revenue and earnings growth? Is it imminent at this point or is it more FY 2022? \nSteve Demetriou: Yes, Andy. It would be FY 2022. Right now, how those programs and projects go. We start off with early concept and we call it basis of design activities, higher margin consultative type work, but to really see it flow through the P&L we'd be in subsequent phases of the project, which these are fast projects. So we're measuring in quarters not years with regards to how those would burn through the P&L.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nBob Pragada: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Steve, you indicated about the optimism was, I guess is fair relative to U.S. infrastructure opportunities. Maybe you can delve a little bit more deeply from your framework agreements with the customer base and some of the myriad of where their energy transition grid, climate change, there's a lot of numbers there. And I'm kidding, but how \u2013 what kind of leverage and potential opportunities could we see from your U.S. business on the P&PS side given what could be coming down the pike over the next several years?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes. Michael, thanks for that. So look, this we are building optimism obviously based on the news we're all reading and we're very highly engaged. And I do want to start with that. Our U.S. government relations team have done an outstanding job to help influence this outcome, which of course it's important for Jacobs, but it's highly important for the United States. So what we got here is a five-year authorization. That's going to provide our state local clients significant certainty, and that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this trillion dollar, $550 billion of new money of is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components like Amtrak and freight rail, which is going to quadruple and funding, drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up two and a half times, therefore, it's more than doubling. Ports and waterways, we're industry leader, same thing. And then you then tack onto that, things like super fund and Army Corps civil works, which are right up where we're \u2013 the leader in the industry across that growing significantly. And that's pretty fast starting opportunities, the way the money will flow. And then of course, what you talked about Michael, energy transition resilience and a whole host of other things, $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions. So just a great, great opportunity for Jacobs moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSean Eastman: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on Focus 2023, maybe at the risk of feeling a bit thunder from the planned Analyst Day, but I think the initial perception around Focus 2023 was \u2013 it was a real estate kind of cost save type of strategy, talking to you guys through the quarter. It seems like it's much more than that. Could you just talk about how Focus 2023 is reflected in the double digit EBITDA growth outlook for fiscal 2022 and beyond maybe kind of clear up how we should think about? How it hits the model?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. I'm glad to answer it because the Focus 2023 is a far reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We've talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint becomes more about collaboration, team building, training, and less about a place where you go and do hedge down work. So it clearly as part of that, but it's much more than that. And effectively what we're doing is aligning, creating a more disciplined in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time. And what I will call the administering of our projects, that's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. Now relative to the double digit numbers, what we said, and certainly in 2022, our plan is that the bulk of the savings, what we're working on finalizing right now in 2022, we'll be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide, or at least preliminary double digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different types of work, becoming more digital and its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Adam for Jerry today. I was wondering in PA Consulting, if you could just help us think about the incoming cadence of engagements there in the next several quarters?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, Adam, the engagements are on the rise pipeline is growing. Kevin talked about the backlog growth. We're seeing when we talk about just concentrate on the private sector for a moment, kind of this investment in supply chain resiliency, as well as business transformation, PA is playing on both sides. And so we were seeing those engagements definitely on the rise and it's forming itself or showing itself from pipeline growth as well as booking growth. So we see that tail having a nice outlook on it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Carolina on behalf of Chad.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nBob Pragada: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. As you think about double digit EBITDA growth over the medium term, can you parse out the contribution from PA Consulting revenue growth and second our margin expansion?\nSteve Demetriou: I think when we talk about the robust opportunity moving into 2022 and beyond, we're really talking about all three legs of the business via Consulting, CMS and P&PS. Almost from a standpoint of them directly contributing to that double-digit growth. I mean, CMS specifically, we talk about this $30 plus billion of new business pipeline. We're excited about the wide range. We \u2013 the Department of Defense for example, is shifting into our major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making, all of their systems more intelligent. And we play a center role there as because of the capabilities that we bring in some of the proven abilities in most recent projects.  Bob talked about the space cycle, the deep space exploration, as well as Space Intelligence. And then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly, as we've talked about in our \u2013 during our remarks. But the cyber and intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean, when you look at the capability that we created going back to over the last seven or eight years with starting with FNS acquisition, then Blue Canopy, and most recently KeyW and The Buffalo Group. The leadership there and critical mission solution that are now really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence. The fact that now we're up to 12 of the 18 intelligence agencies that we're working for. So very exciting opportunity that CMS is going to contribute to the other side of the P&PS and PA.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann from Baird. Your line is now open.\nAndy Wittmann: Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had, I guess three clarification for Kevin to make sure that I'm understanding the financial statements correctly. The first one has to do with, excuse me, the $267 million from last quarter that you had to expense for GAAP rules on the purchase consideration. It looks like net of some people retiring or quitting or whatever happened at PA that the net number here was $261 million, like you called out in your press release. So, there's a $6 million difference there. And I was wondering if that benefit showed up in which segment, was that in the PA segment, was that an SG&A? And then was that excluded or benefit to adjusted EPS as a gain in a quarter? And then secondarily I was, excuse me, noticing that there was $158 million of accounts receivable, which as far as I can tell is the best quarter you've ever had in taking down accounts receivable. So, I was just wondering, Kevin, if you could talk about whether that's just timing related or do you think there's a structural element to what you did in the quarter on the very good account receivable performance?\nKevin Berryman: Yes, so, let me go through the first one quickly. The accounting and the complexity associated with PA because of not all of the equity pieces that we've been talking about, but also the backing out and non-controlling interest and all that kind of stuff. All of that, we did not take that benefit to our P&L that $6 million that you're alluding to. But maybe we can follow-up and John can provide you a little bit more detail there John. The second thing is, as it relates to [indiscernible] accounts receivable, sorry. No, we look, I think that while certainly a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter. And so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last two or three years. And we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job. This is ultimately having something to do with some of the focus 2023 work we're doing where we're fine tuning and aligning our processes, where people are being able to, to get invoices out faster and ultimately more accurate invoices, which is facilitating our ability to collect sooner. So, while there certainly is some timing associated with it, it's good old fashioned, just doing good work, collecting sooner, and ultimately don't necessarily assume that that happens every single quarter to the extend its in. But we think these kinds of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies and total working capital.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Two questions. First, Kevin the margins in P&PS were pretty good at 13.8%. I just wanted to know if there was anything in that number to help boost the margins, or is that just core performance? And then second on CMS what's the \u2013 as we're thinking about 2022, what's the opportunity here at some point to get those margins more in the double-digit range? And then my last question, understanding right now, you're focusing on de-leveraging, but the cashflow is pretty good and the net leverage is looking pretty good. As we look at 2022, at what point would you feel comfortable doing deals again, or do you think you have too much on your plate? And how should we be thinking about more opportunities to do deals that would like a, more of the PA consulting type acquisitions? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Bob talked about it, $30 billion. It's typically higher margin profile. And as that plays out, we'll see, given the mix of that, what the driver is to, to margin. Our objectives longer term is that our margin profile continues to grow across all of our businesses, including CMS. Probably getting into a strategic commentary that we're going to wait and hold on relative to our discussion at the end of the year and our Investor Day, but ultimately our expectation is that our margins will be able to go up in all of our businesses and certainly CMS would be included in that. So, I think that that's one thing. The second one.\nBob Pragada: So let me just add the P&PS questions Jamie, that you started with. There's nothing special. I mean, it's really driven by strong value-add strategy that we've been talking about. So not for the point up there from a P&PS standpoint, other than great performance. The M&A side that you've talked about, clearly, we're very pleased with our cash flow and the approved balance sheet. We're obviously very excited about how fast of a start we're up to on the PA consulting. It's proving out what we talked about as far as high margin, high growth business, and the significant synergies with our total Jacobs platform. And so, we're going to finalize our strategic approach as part of this new strategy we're developing and we'll get clarity before the end of the year. But clearly the strategic consulting side is going to be one of the key components to unfold.\nJamie Cook: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line, Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey good morning again. I just want to follow-up on PA consulting. It's obviously still early in your ownership, but maybe you could talk about how successful so far, you've been in bringing PA into markets where it has lower penetration, such as the U.S. Now successful [indiscernible] you had been so far in capturing more front-end consulting work because obviously the push toward more front-end work could be a big deal for you guys.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, Andy, on the first part of the question, I would say, we exceeded expectations in the first three months of the investment on bringing PA into the U.S. And I'd probably point more to the private sector of that piece. PA traditionally and this is just to be even more specific, PA traditionally had relationships at the kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 life sciences clients. And whether it be MedTech and kind of product technology, or looking at the digitization of a component of their business, such as clinical trials, or other types of health information items, honed it in on a few a few Tier 2 or Tier 3. We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank and those same offerings at larger scale we're getting penetration on. So that's been \u2013 that's a big, big piece. Secondly \u2013 and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings and where those are coming from leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and I had it in the script. So, on the Fuji job, as we look at how we can continue to deliver next generation type services to go faster, quite frankly. PA is working with us on Fuji to automate our entire \u2013 our design approach. So, it's a great example of the digital skills of PA being brought into our core domain expertise and moving us up the value chain. So, really strong.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fisher: Great, thanks. Good morning. I apologize I got on the call a little late, so if you've covered this, we can take it offline. But just curious about organic growth and the pace of growth there. I know, I think Kevin in the comments in the press release talked about being set up, or maybe it was Steve for nice structural growth from a number of initiatives over the next several years. Just curious about the timing of the acceleration that we could see here in your core, CMS and P&PS segment. Do you think we're sort of at that inflection point right now? Is it still, and these are fairly longer cycle businesses, is it still going to be something that takes place more in 2022? I know you talked about double digit EBITDA growth, how much of that is a function of accelerating revenue growth? If you could just fill in a little color there, thank you.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. So, look, let me mention a few things we hadn't talked about yet with regard to in the Q&A is we talk a lot about what's going on in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. our organic growth activity is clearly ramping up, we have a strong pipeline in the UK. Similar drivers there with infrastructure, stimulus and focus on modernization, especially in the rail side and de-carbonization, and we're expanding into Europe with some new programs on the airport sector. And then when we move over to the Middle East, we're seeing a really good pipeline and organic opportunity in places like Saudi and across the region in high-speed rail and also on the defense side as well. And then similar things going on in parts of APAC and Australia, New Zealand. Solid pipeline in Australia, New Zealand across transportation. Also, the power sector there and the whole sustainable solution. So wanted to kind of start with that. When you take a step back and look at Jacobs\u2019 opportunity to grow organically, what we see is things are in different phases. Clearly what Bob talked about around electronics and life sciences, that's going to be a more rapid ramp up as we get into over the next several quarters, because of what \u2013 especially what's going on around semiconductors. When we talk about this U.S. infrastructure opportunity a bulk of it's going to be programmatic funding. And so therefore formulaic funding, I should've said. And so therefore some of our frameworks and the way the funding will flow will happen with more and sort of ramping up and some of it, even in the early parts of 2022. But as we get into some of the newer initiatives that the government is focusing on around resilience and energy transition, and some of the other digital opportunities, some of that will take a few extra quarters for that funding to flow to the various agencies. And the critical mission solution side, if you look back to our \u2013 the way Jacobs has unfolded over the last several years, it tends to come in, in certain peaks. And we're building up this great pipeline, we're very optimistic around the things that we've talked about and then the only question is does it hit next quarter or does it hit a couple quarters later? But when it comes, it's going to have a meaningful impact to our 2022 and moving into 2023 and beyond. So overall, we just continue to be very bullish on our ability to grow organically before we even think about deploying capital to on the M&A side. Okay, so I think\u2026\nOperator: Speakers there are no further questions in the queue, please continue.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you. Okay, thanks everyone. I appreciate the questions. Stay safe, and to look forward to staying close with all of you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contribute to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn off two lower margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 at 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately eight percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, favorable revenue mix in both People & Places and CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year in line with our expectations to 17%. GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $15 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32% with both CMS and People & Places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth and operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago second. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share, and primarily included $0.44 related to an updated non-cash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares with no impact to the original consideration, $0.34 related to the UK statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate. $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles, all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% \u2013 by a 20% effective tax rate to reflect the change in our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder from modeling purposes, before we consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results with 35% minority interest backed out in non-controlling interest. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was one times for Q3 with actually a little bit higher book-to-bills of 1.1 on a gross margin level. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 2% pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off two lower margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff at FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million quarter of year-over-year impact from these two contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and our first quarter of fiscal 2022. CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year. And we expect mid single digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions, as well as benefits from the FX. While the Americas business saw near term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result and customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning on our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum when combined with the strength of our advanced facilities business noted earlier by Bob positions us well into 2022. Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year including [ph] the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $256 million in revenue and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22% in line with our expectations. Finally, our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate cost to also turn slightly higher in Q4 given continued increases in the medical costs, and other investments, as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges has significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. Comment quickly during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023, as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook. And we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. It is important to know this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million putting us on track for greater than one time adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we also monetized our investments C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and growth debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership, treating the Worley position as cash our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. Now let me turn it back over to Steve for Slide 13. Joe just real quickly on the adjusted free cash flow that we talked about, there's two items effectively. The most material one is the $261 million of the compensation treated numbers associated with PA that was ultimately originally part of our consideration. But because of GAAP, we had to run it through the P&L that's 261, and we have another 19 of restructuring related matters which are just timing relative to the P&L. But you also heard me talked about, which was $2 million. Those two added together, take our reported free cash flow to the $430 plus million for the quarter. Really strong and we're very pleased with it. Yes, so, let me go through the first one quickly. The accounting and the complexity associated with PA because of not all of the equity pieces that we've been talking about, but also the backing out and non-controlling interest and all that kind of stuff. All of that, we did not take that benefit to our P&L that $6 million that you're alluding to. But maybe we can follow-up and John can provide you a little bit more detail there John. The second thing is, as it relates to [indiscernible] accounts receivable, sorry. No, we look, I think that while certainly a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter. And so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last two or three years. And we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job.

But we think these kinds of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies and total working capital. Yes.

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7, to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4 resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong, positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends in recent related wins in greater detail. Beginning with energy transition, progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cutoff CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global lifecycle nuclear capabilities. This includes advanced modular reactors or AMRs that can be used for electricity generation and for the \u2013 and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project that Idaho National Laboratory, as a majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a ten-year period and recently cleared protests. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the BOE, we will use Jacobs' technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the cold war, while delivering social value by supporting high quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Plain Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry. Moving on to space-based ISR, the U.S. Military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, out-think and outmaneuver bursaries across the multiple domains, land, sea, air, cyber, and increasingly space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR. And advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs has won a two-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to five times less than legacy space, radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added commercial, space-based AESAs. Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data, often collected from multiple sources, are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and of adversary activity, ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs' recent Buffalo Group acquisition won two attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902d Military Group CI Human Intelligence Analytical Services contract is a $234 million five-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM's, counter intelligence and counter terrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protests and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army's biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DirecTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G's higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities fueling growth in our telecom business. In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection, and importantly with an increasing margin profile. Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance driven by our strategy to focus on high value sectors in key geographic regions leveraging our strong global integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a one times book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure, modernization and digitalization, as well as accelerated supply chain demands and areas driven by the pandemic are catalyzing our clients' mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multi-year trends, align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business. Starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions, aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force in their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by Environment Analyst as the number one leader in water quality and resources. And our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base Coastal Resilience study in Florida, was recognized as a global winner at the UK Environment Agency's 2021 Flood & Coast awards. Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we're winning major projects around the globe, such as the east-west rail program partner in the UK, a major U.S. transit authority's, metro rail platform reconstruction and the KiwiRail monitorization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally enabled solutions. We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope launched today. Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients, and capital planning and maps that true risks, costs and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. As an example, for the healthcare sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real time, meteorological, traffic, and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with their clients to reinvent healthcare of tomorrow.  Shifting to our advanced facility sector. We believe we are entering an unprecedented multiyear growth cycle. In our electronic sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given the long-term demand in cloud and edge computing, data storage and smart infrastructure such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with a goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in this space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, new Greenfield Campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We have also secured a major contract with Nature Works to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand, dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including challenge from India and the Philippines. Finally, as it relates to pandemic driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again, combined our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We're performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent large revenue synergy in the UK that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs win the new UK Department of Food and Rural Affairs Management Consultancy contract, a large scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint research continued to be across other regions and geographies. And I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. As we looked at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the UK's government \u2013 UK government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model and in health and life sciences virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise and consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience, and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for TeakOrigin and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious iF design awards. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results. Yes, Joe, good morning. On the Space Intelligence, it's really has to do with our some of the unique technologies around array technology. And we're not \u2013 I can't disclose the decline, but this is a multi-phase type project. And so we're on the front end of the development of that project. And so we see continued growth there. Just to add onto that, what we're also seeing with our SAR technology or the Synthetic Aperture Radar is the air-based component of what's coming out of our Rapid Solutions business. A couple of really nice wins confidential there again, early phases, but seeing the investment on that front. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. So let me just add the P&PS questions Jamie, that you started with. There's nothing special. I mean, it's really driven by strong value-add strategy that we've been talking about. So not for the point up there from a P&PS standpoint, other than great performance. The M&A side that you've talked about, clearly, we're very pleased with our cash flow and the approved balance sheet. We're obviously very excited about how fast of a start we're up to on the PA consulting. It's proving out what we talked about as far as high margin, high growth business, and the significant synergies with our total Jacobs platform. And so, we're going to finalize our strategic approach as part of this new strategy we're developing and we'll get clarity before the end of the year. But clearly the strategic consulting side is going to be one of the key components to unfold."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "All right, thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year, 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4, before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we are developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy along with updated, multi-year financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. Turning to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro-forma basis. And our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation. Now that the award has cleared protest, when including Idaho, total Jacobs' reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a proforma basis for Idaho up 6%. Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year, 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super cycle in global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductors and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year, 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep, domain knowledge and investments in technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients' challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are, we do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. Building on our plan beyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG focused, digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high priority challenges like climate change and how they are creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives and throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions at action. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon neutral facilities as part of their journey to net zero emissions, an effort that may result at rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical times. And in the UK we're researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high growth business for Jacobs today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with via consulting Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detailed by line of business. Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong year-to-date performance, excellent results from our PA Consulting investment and the benefit from the lower tax rate, we're raising our full year guidance. We now expect the adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.21 billion to $1.275 billion versus our previous outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.27 billion. We expect adjusted EPS to now be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35 per share versus our previous outlook of $6 to $6.30. Looking beyond fiscal 2021. The likelihood of U.S. infrastructure stimulus package has substantially increased over the last week, which has become a significant benefit to our Jacobs P&L in the second half of our fiscal year 2022 and beyond. With the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, we are aligned to strong secular growth trends, including global infrastructure modernization, climate change, national security, digital transformation, and global supply chain investments. As a result, we expect this to drive double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Good morning. Yes, Andy. It would be FY 2022. Right now, how those programs and projects go. We start off with early concept and we call it basis of design activities, higher margin consultative type work, but to really see it flow through the P&L we'd be in subsequent phases of the project, which these are fast projects. So we're measuring in quarters not years with regards to how those would burn through the P&L. Good morning. Yes. Michael, thanks for that. So look, this we are building optimism obviously based on the news we're all reading and we're very highly engaged. And I do want to start with that. Our U.S. government relations team have done an outstanding job to help influence this outcome, which of course it's important for Jacobs, but it's highly important for the United States. So what we got here is a five-year authorization. That's going to provide our state local clients significant certainty, and that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this trillion dollar, $550 billion of new money of is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components like Amtrak and freight rail, which is going to quadruple and funding, drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up two and a half times, therefore, it's more than doubling. Ports and waterways, we're industry leader, same thing. And then you then tack onto that, things like super fund and Army Corps civil works, which are right up where we're \u2013 the leader in the industry across that growing significantly. And that's pretty fast starting opportunities, the way the money will flow. And then of course, what you talked about Michael, energy transition resilience and a whole host of other things, $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions. So just a great, great opportunity for Jacobs moving forward. Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. I'm glad to answer it because the Focus 2023 is a far reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We've talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint becomes more about collaboration, team building, training, and less about a place where you go and do hedge down work. So it clearly as part of that, but it's much more than that. And effectively what we're doing is aligning, creating a more disciplined in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time. And what I will call the administering of our projects, that's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. Now relative to the double digit numbers, what we said, and certainly in 2022, our plan is that the bulk of the savings, what we're working on finalizing right now in 2022, we'll be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide, or at least preliminary double digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different types of work, becoming more digital and its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022. Yes, Adam, the engagements are on the rise pipeline is growing. Kevin talked about the backlog growth. We're seeing when we talk about just concentrate on the private sector for a moment, kind of this investment in supply chain resiliency, as well as business transformation, PA is playing on both sides. And so we were seeing those engagements definitely on the rise and it's forming itself or showing itself from pipeline growth as well as booking growth. So we see that tail having a nice outlook on it. Good morning. I think when we talk about the robust opportunity moving into 2022 and beyond, we're really talking about all three legs of the business via Consulting, CMS and P&PS. Almost from a standpoint of them directly contributing to that double-digit growth. I mean, CMS specifically, we talk about this $30 plus billion of new business pipeline. We're excited about the wide range. We \u2013 the Department of Defense for example, is shifting into our major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making, all of their systems more intelligent. And we play a center role there as because of the capabilities that we bring in some of the proven abilities in most recent projects.  Bob talked about the space cycle, the deep space exploration, as well as Space Intelligence. And then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly, as we've talked about in our \u2013 during our remarks. But the cyber and intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean, when you look at the capability that we created going back to over the last seven or eight years with starting with FNS acquisition, then Blue Canopy, and most recently KeyW and The Buffalo Group. The leadership there and critical mission solution that are now really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence. The fact that now we're up to 12 of the 18 intelligence agencies that we're working for. So very exciting opportunity that CMS is going to contribute to the other side of the P&PS and PA. Bob talked about it, $30 billion. It's typically higher margin profile. And as that plays out, we'll see, given the mix of that, what the driver is to, to margin. Our objectives longer term is that our margin profile continues to grow across all of our businesses, including CMS. Probably getting into a strategic commentary that we're going to wait and hold on relative to our discussion at the end of the year and our Investor Day, but ultimately our expectation is that our margins will be able to go up in all of our businesses and certainly CMS would be included in that. So, I think that that's one thing. The second one. Yes, Andy, on the first part of the question, I would say, we exceeded expectations in the first three months of the investment on bringing PA into the U.S. And I'd probably point more to the private sector of that piece. PA traditionally and this is just to be even more specific, PA traditionally had relationships at the kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 life sciences clients. And whether it be MedTech and kind of product technology, or looking at the digitization of a component of their business, such as clinical trials, or other types of health information items, honed it in on a few a few Tier 2 or Tier 3. We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank and those same offerings at larger scale we're getting penetration on. So that's been \u2013 that's a big, big piece. Secondly \u2013 and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings and where those are coming from leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and I had it in the script. So, on the Fuji job, as we look at how we can continue to deliver next generation type services to go faster, quite frankly. PA is working with us on Fuji to automate our entire \u2013 our design approach. So, it's a great example of the digital skills of PA being brought into our core domain expertise and moving us up the value chain. So, really strong. Thank you. Okay, thanks everyone. I appreciate the questions. Stay safe, and to look forward to staying close with all of you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Jacobs Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast . I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning. We have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. During the presentation, we'll be in forward-looking statements, including with respect to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, potential government stimulus programs and our financial outlook, among others. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is included on Slide 2 regarding these and other forward-looking statements.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supplies. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic, including, for example, our operations in the Philippines. Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return. As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security. We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. Similar to last quarter, I will discuss four notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy. Beginning with space exploration and intelligence. From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft and the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallace Flight facility located in Virginia, and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers. We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan congressional support with preliminary FY22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense based spending was up 28% in FY21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY22 as well. Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all source intelligence capability. We were awarded two exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, DCTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe. We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion Solutions for Information Technology Enterprise, or SITE III, IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget, redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from states are anticipated.\nKevin Berryman: Thanks, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a quick financial review. Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn off of two lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth from a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continued headwinds in CMS from the lower margin contracts coming to an end. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by three factors. Improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher margin business, a favorable impact from lower benefit costs and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. From a line of business standpoint, CMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix.  gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in GA as a percentage of revenue as a result of an expected rebound in labor related medical costs, IT related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth. GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation given retention related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at \u00a31.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flotation of the $267 million later in my remarks. In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment, $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32% with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark to market investment in Worley and AR software provider, C3ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs; and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with the 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2 with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off two lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these two contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher margin Buffalo Group business. For the second half fiscal 2021, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition are expected to offset the revenue headwinds previously discussed. Given the strategy to capture higher value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and the rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our advanced facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. Total P&PS operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our focused 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth, high margin opportunities and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period, even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again, at \u00a31.4 billion. Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included $42 million repayment of the UK VAT tax benefit from fiscal year \u201820 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a standalone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12 month basis. Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12 month period, even when including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $267 million investment consideration now characterized as P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the Worley and C3ai equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong first half performance and the benefit from the PA consulting investment, we're raising our full year guidance ranges. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.2 billion to $1.27 billion versus our previous outlook of $1.075 billion to $1.155 billion. We expect adjusted EPS to now be in a range of $6 to $6.30 versus our previous outlook of $5.30 to $6. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, with optimism building around a major US stimulus package and significant opportunities related to climate change and digital modernization, we are positioned for strong revenue and double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maybe one for Bob or Steve, on the infrastructure side. Wondering if you could just focus on two things, timing. How quickly do you think you see it in your numbers, maybe what you're monitoring that will inform that? And then competitively, the industry is obviously a lot more consolidated now than it was in prior cycles. Can you talk about the implications of that for your business and maybe the margin profile for over P&PS over this upcoming cycle?\nSteve Demetriou: So let me just start with a couple of high level comments, Joe, is that the timing is something that we expect to -- we're not going to see the final decision and what this is all about until probably later this summer, could go into early fall. And so we'll start to see momentum pick up sometime in 2022. But I think the strategic driver for us is that whether you look at the Biden proposal or even the Republican also, which was somewhat watered down and we expect it to be somewhere between the two is that it's significant growth, there's going to be a lot of opportunity for a lot of the companies out there. And I think for us being a margin focused company and seeing the evolution of what we've been doing over the last few years is the two things for us is that as there's a need for resources, we have the best global integrated capability to bring the resources to the right place and to really focus on the highest margin opportunities as that unfolds in both businesses and P&PS at CMS. Bob?\nBob Pragada: Maybe the add on the competitive climate, So Joe, where we sit with regard to framework agreements that we've had, not just in the US, but stimulus is also affecting the UK and Australia and other locations around the world, are pretty ideal for where those monies would flow. So if you look at transportation frameworks, water frameworks that we've been on for several years, it's going to position us extremely well. And those are pretty secure because the money needs to flow pretty quickly. So coupled with the fact that we're on these higher end services, I think the competitive climate we stand will fair well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Bob, maybe I could follow up in a sense that. During the 2019 Analyst Day, you listed a 4% to 6% target for P&PS, it was called something else at the time but it's similar sort of the move forward. Are you able to give us any color regarding the ballpark of organic growth Jacobs may be able to deliver above and beyond that? And then if for some reason the similar doesn't go through given all these trends that you've been talking about ESG, sustainability, advanced facilities. Is 4% to 6% the baseline you could do more than that you think going over the next couple of years?\nSteve Demetriou: We're not going to provide any guidance relative to 2022 at this point in time. But I think we're feeling pretty good about the developing momentum. So we certainly, as we work through it, I think it's important to note Steve's comments relative to we're not going to go after everything. We're going to go after those things that ultimately give us the best margin potential. So I think we're excited about what \u201822 can ultimately look to and certainly, I would suggest it's probably not going down.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Really outstanding performance from PA Consulting out of the gate for you folks. I'm wondering can you talk about whether the $300 million quarterly run rate that the business was on in March. How has that momentum translated into the second quarter? And how much variability is there in that business given the length of engagements now that we're getting to know the business a bit more?\nBob Pragada: Jerry, I think the client engagements and the client stickiness call it, is solid. And so yes, the size of the engagement might be different than we would have historically seen at kind of Jacobs. But the longevity with their clients really just from the technology and the value they're contributing shows the future to be really bright. So we're feeling very positive.\nSteve Demetriou: Just to build on the other part of your question, Jerry, is PA Consulting did a really great job on positioning themselves to win in sort of COVID solutions, and Bob talked about that and still got some runway on it. But what they're also now seeing is several of there are other markets picking up and so that bodes well as some of the COVID work starts to phase out this other work phasing in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Just a question on the space exploration and intelligence vertical, you highlighted in the remarks. Can you just give us some color on the commercial dynamics? You seem unique and that you're touching the very large  launch but also have exposure on the small sat side with assets like Mango that you mentioned. Are you leveraged to one end of the market or the other large or small sat? Just how should we think about Jacobs sitting into the conversation over cube sats versus some of these larger opportunities?\nSteve Demetriou: Well, just, again, maybe to start with the broader space for us is it's pretty wide ranging for us. As we have always been a major player with deep space exploration and NASA being a major client for ours and we're solidly positioned there around Artemis and the research and development work they're doing around hypersonics and space architecture, et cetera. And now with the KeyW acquisition, ramping up very nicely, the whole low earth orbit, ISR, Rapid Solutions. And then you go beyond there with missile defense and some of the other aspects of space, it's become a very major market for us, specifically. Bob, around the commercial sector?\nBob Pragada: I think that the adjacent and knock on effects of what we're doing, not just exploration but how that feeds into intelligence is strong. If you look at the Mango One launch, the application centered around intelligence but also the application into 5G and other commercial applications is going to continue to broaden markets that we haven't had exposed to in the past. So other things that Steve said is really expanding that aperture on the applications.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: I guess two questions. My first question, sort of going back to potential infrastructure, Bill, Steve. Are there any investments that you think are required from Jacobs in order to capitalize it? Do you feel like you have the right labor for so you're in the right niches, or do you go back and sort of contemplate M&A again. So I guess that's my first question. And then my second question, I think you noted revenues from ESG are approaching $5 billion or so. Can you talk to sort of what the underlying growth trends that you're seeing in that business and how to think about the profitability of the businesses that are more ESG focused.\nSteve Demetriou: We couldn't be better positioned from a standpoint of the M&A activity that's behind us. Obviously, CH2M combined with Jacobs positions us to be the major player here. And by the way that we can't keep getting to remind everyone, one of the biggest acquisitions in our industry going very well. When you look at what we paid for that compared to what it's generating today, extremely attractive financially but obviously, Jamie, helps us position to be a big winner. But then you have on top of that the PA Consulting acquisition, which now provides end-to-end capability from front end consulting all the way through delivery and ultimately things like O&M, et cetera. So from a climate change extent. So as far as other M&A, we're going to continue to look at things that can move us up the food chain from a margin standpoint, possibly some geographic expansion. But as far as the US infrastructure stimulus opportunity, I think we're extremely well positioned with the organic capability we have today. And on the climate change side, when you look at the $5 billion, it's really wide ranging of what we're in. But as you look at the growth going forward, it's going to be everything from how do we help our clients adapt and mitigate. So whether it's C-level rise, or flooding, or bush fires and droughts, the whole energy transition equation moving away from fossil fuels into clean energy, and that's both working with our government and private clients, eveyone is looking to reduce their carbon footprint, that\u2019s where we come in around the whole decarbonization and eliminating or reducing greenhouse gases and then things like natural resource stewardship, which is critical across the globe. It's a global opportunity. We\u2019re positioned well as an end to end solutions provider and bringing some unique tools and innovation, because it\u2019s going to require digital transformation to achieve these type of climate change transformative expectations by our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher: So at the risk of making this a broad question or maybe something that gone on your Investor Day. Could you just run through some of your key margin initiatives and where you see the most progress made and where you have the most upside potential here? I know you've got the CMS margin mix. You've got the future of awards and a few other things, maybe just kind of give us an update on the margin potential?\nSteve Demetriou: When you talk about margin initiatives, it's been both organic and inorganic. One of the things we're extremely proud of around our Critical Mission Solutions line of business is all the acquisitions that recent acquisitions, KeyW, Wood Nuclear, Buffalo Group, they're all performing very well, strong first half versus last first half pro forma and they're all margin accretive to our CMS line of business. And so from that standpoint, I think that's a key addition to our margin enhancement. But then it really goes back to what we were talking about earlier to our whole global integrated delivery profile to not only bring the best resources but be more efficient in certain aspects of the whole delivery model and much more around the whole business acumen, commercial acumen side now versus several years ago and really identifying where the margin opportunities are, not just going after any business for the sake of growth. Bob, what else on that front?\nBob Pragada: Yes, I think it's just staying on that digital theme, Steve, and we're looking at it both externally and internally. So for example, rationalizing our internal platforms on how we transact our business is going to have derivative benefits. Kevin's talked about it before with regards to operating leverage. And then externally, if you have to point to one, it really is around the digitization of our offering. So autonomous design, machine learning, looking at the digitization of the global delivery model and then how that can provide value solutions in a more efficient way, so it's a big .\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: \u2026focus on just some of the cybersecurity issue that we've -- that's materialized over the  and really we focus the need to reinforce the  infrastructure in the US. And I just want to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about deploying what's been more like  focused cybersecurity initiative to the private sector and how are you thinking about your go-to-market strategy there?\nSteve Demetriou: Chad, I think we missed the first part of your question. It sounds like it's around cyber, but can you just kind of reask it and you summarize it.\nChad Dillard: So I just wanted to get a sense for how you're thinking about the opportunities on cybersecurities given that there's been kind of pack on the critical infrastructure here in the US over the weekend. And then you guys have had a strong heritage in the government side and just wanted to understand how you're developing opportunities on the size and what your go-to-market strategy is there?\nSteve Demetriou: We're actually in the middle of it right now and I can't speak too much into the details, but the events I think that you were highlighting over the weekend, we are engaged on that, too. Kind of the portal there on leveraging it in the private sector has been our strong heritage also in the private sector with the other portfolio offerings that we have. Specifically, if it's in the hydrocarbon space, we did quite a bit of environmental remediation and regulatory work in that space. Using that as the portal in order to bring in our cyber expertise, whether it\u2019d be OT or IT has been a strong initiative and we're seeing some traction there, not just in an emergency situation but also as a part of cyber hardening of these companies. And then in other private sectors that we have, whether it\u2019d be facility, specialized manufacturing. All those things that we do for the government, the road map points to our ability to leverage our longstanding private sector relationships and do the same. So you'll see more of that coming in the coming months and coming quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: I just wanted to go back to PA Consulting. I'm not sure if I'm looking at this the right way, but PA did $0.09 of accretion in the month of March. But if I take that out of the accretion update for the full year, it kind of implies they're doing $0.04 a month for the remaining six months of the fiscal year. So I'm trying to understand that. And then also whether the previous expectation of $0.52 to $0.57 of accretion on a full year basis in fiscal '22 is still a good way to think about it?\nKevin Berryman: So a couple of comments, Sean. This is Kevin. So As you think about kind of the pace of their profitability over the course of their quarters, they, like us, we have four, four or five kind of months within each quarter. And the way they handle their fixed costs and how they amortize that over the months versus the amount of revenue they get in that last month their last month tends to be the strongest month in the quarter. So effectively, don't necessarily take that $0.09 and assume that all the way through. So I think that that's one thing to recognize. So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining six months, it is basically that number. We think that, that is really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model. And ultimately, we're hoping given the strong start that maybe there could be some opportunity to improve on that over the balance of the year. But so far, they started strong. And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter, but some of that's going to go away over there second, third and fourth calendar quarters for their year. And they have to do a really good job on replacing that over the balance of the year. So we feel good about the guidance we've provided. And ultimately, hopefully, that pipeline will continue to translate into incremental backlog, which could result in potentially being a little bit higher. But I think we're being prudent in terms of our guidance for PA at this point in time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe for Bob, maybe to elaborate a little bit more on life science and advanced manufacturing. Certainly, the news flow and the supply chain issues with regard to the electronics industry has been front center many investors. Are we getting to a point where there's going to be a significant investment that's going to show up and run through your PM work in the next six to 12 months. And even on the Life Science side, is it more of a global opportunity, and certainly globally positioned. But we've been hearing more about US supply chain, but is there more -- you\u2019re going to be more driven globally, whether it's a vaccine side or biologics, or some of the electronics opportunities that you're working with your clients there?\nBob Pragada: Michael, let me kind of unpack both sides of that. On the semiconductor side, I'm not sure if you asked about that or life sciences, it is global. It's probably more focused in on the US for us right now. When I say US, US clients as well as agent clients that are building in the US. You're even seeing it in the stimulus bill with President Biden's efforts in order to increase that capacity here on US soil as global supply chains have been kind of rejiggered. And so we do see that having a positive effect on Jacobs. I don't know if it's necessarily six months. It's probably got a longer tail on that and eased through the next 12 to 24 months, but that's a strong trend. And it's both not only on the logic side but it's also on memory chips and some of the lower end chips that you're hearing from some of the automotive issues that are going around. Online sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us, and that is the rebalancing of the product portfolio, all of this attention that\u2019s been placed on vaccines, specifically around the coronavirus. Great development that's happening within the oncology world. And as I said in the remarks, that's driving a real need for contract manufacturing, probably like nothing we've seen in history because of the volumes that are needed and the speed to market around these new therapies. So overall, really, really solid picture for at least the next couple of years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: There was a few mentions on the call about increasing investments in SG&A and IT, travel and medical. I understand the investments are for the better growth outlook. When we think about your tentative guide for double digit EBITDA growth in 2022, is there any leverage on top of that top line or the initiatives around the margin? Is it really all set to really expand incrementals in 2023 and beyond? Just curious how we should think about that trade off with a better growth outlook and some inflationary pressures that'd be building as we think of the double digit and beyond for 2022 and 2023?\nSteve Demetriou: So a couple of comments, Michael, first one on on the margin front or the percent of revenue that SG&A represents. We're still in a good spot relative to historical numbers. So don't think of this as being something that's going to be a big challenge for us, but we do find it necessary to make these investments. I think the next comment I would make is that's what Focus 2023 is really all about to ensure that we get improved operating leverage through the process and system enhancements that we're talking about, which will allow us as the growth dynamic begins to accelerate, which we talked about, assuming it's going to happen in 2022, and that's going to be really important for two reasons, one, to get the operating leverage. But I think the other way to think about it is if we can get that growth and afford ourselves the same ability not to hire at the same level that we've had to in past growth spurts, that's going to be really, really strong for us. So there obviously is a war for talent. And to the extent that we're going to be able to supply that incremental growth with less headcount having to be added to support it that's going to be a big positive for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: First off, when we're thinking about PA Consulting, I know you guys have spoken to double digit EBITDA growth and about 12% revenue prior to the deal here. But regarding the strategic partnership, how are you thinking about that going forward? Does that still feel like something comfortable or are there more opportunities now that the partnership is intact?\nSteve Demetriou: There's more than we intended. In fact, what we've done -- so I mean the headline is the level of engagement and the collaborative pursuits that we have is strong. And just to quantify, we kind of thought that we would be in that maybe 40 to 50 type collaborative pursuits that would have 12 to 18 month gestation period to them, that number\u2019s -- probably double that right now, and we're getting heavily engaged and we see that getting even stronger as travel restrictions come down and we're able to jointly see clients together as well. So very strong and I think it's contributing to our optimism as we look forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird.\nAndy Wittmann: I just wanted to clarify two things here. One on the guidance and one on the cash flow, probably both the questions for Kevin. But I guess just, Kevin, I just want to make sure we understand the new guidance correctly. I look at about 10 months of contribution of the EBITDA numbers that you previously talked about with PA, equates about $130 million. Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition. And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more? Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, if it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities. I'm guessing that might be associated with the $267 million that's going to be a cash outflow next quarter, but I don't know. So I was wondering if you could just clarify that benefit to this quarter's cash flow from operations?\nKevin Berryman: So let me go through the second one first. You're exactly right, the $267 million, is a dynamic where the total consideration was reduced by the $267 million and now that $267 million flows through the P&L ultimately in the third quarter. So effectively, that dynamic is occurring. So you're right relative to how that works. Total consideration doesn't change. We're still at the \u00a31.4 billion on sterling. So note that, I think that's important to know, Andy. Second point, in terms of the guide, no, there's -- the guide is effectively -- we took the $0.09 and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong, they got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business NPA is a book-and-burn business, so they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. So back to the base business. Yes, we had good performance in Q2 and effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide is how we\u2019re able to characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Just wanted to ask you a follow-up on CMS in the sense that you guided revenue to flat all and I think for the second half 2021, given the higher headwind from the two new contracts. But you do have easier comparisons if I look at Q3 versus last year, the pandemic disruption. And so are you seeing any delays in that project conversion there in CMS? And then if you look at backlog growth, it looks solid in Q2. So do you see book-to-bill continue to be at or above 1 in the second half of '21?\nSteve Demetriou: We've talked about it for several quarters. We're exiting two low margin large contracts. The Hanford contract and the classified contract that we've spoken about before. When you exclude those two, are critical and you exclude the acquisitions, our base business is growing. I think it's somewhere in the 8% range. And then you add on top of that, obviously, the benefit of the acquisitions that are continuing to ramp up with that on a year-over-year basis more than our -- some of them weren't on our numbers. So I think that we're feeling good about everything that we've talked about with regard to the -- where we're aligned with the growth trends, even though there's a flat defense budget. The things like Space Intelligence and hypersonics, and several of the other items that we mentioned are actually growing nicely. And so there's a lot of shift in funding. Even the DoD climate change initiatives to modernize their infrastructure in the Department of Defense that's helping us. And so overall, we're very pleased with the revenue growth in Critical Mission Solutions.\nOperator: And there are no further questions queued up at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you. So as I close the call, our thoughts are with the people, our people in India, including our Jacobs colleagues, and we'll continue to support them in dealing with the current significant challenges of the pandemic. Looking to the future, we're excited about our strong performance and our solid foundation that provides Jacobs as we develop our new strategy and chart an existing future together, and an exciting future together. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a quick financial review. Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn off of two lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth from a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continued headwinds in CMS from the lower margin contracts coming to an end. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by three factors. Improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher margin business, a favorable impact from lower benefit costs and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. From a line of business standpoint, CMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix.  gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in GA as a percentage of revenue as a result of an expected rebound in labor related medical costs, IT related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth. GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation given retention related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at \u00a31.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flotation of the $267 million later in my remarks. In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment, $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32% with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark to market investment in Worley and AR software provider, C3ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs; and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with the 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2 with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off two lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these two contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher margin Buffalo Group business. For the second half fiscal 2021, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition are expected to offset the revenue headwinds previously discussed. Given the strategy to capture higher value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and the rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our advanced facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. Total P&PS operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our focused 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth, high margin opportunities and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period, even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again, at \u00a31.4 billion. Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included $42 million repayment of the UK VAT tax benefit from fiscal year \u201820 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a standalone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12 month basis. Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12 month period, even when including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $267 million investment consideration now characterized as P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the Worley and C3ai equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve. So a couple of comments, Sean. This is Kevin. So As you think about kind of the pace of their profitability over the course of their quarters, they, like us, we have four, four or five kind of months within each quarter. And the way they handle their fixed costs and how they amortize that over the months versus the amount of revenue they get in that last month their last month tends to be the strongest month in the quarter. So effectively, don't necessarily take that $0.09 and assume that all the way through. So I think that that's one thing to recognize. So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining six months, it is basically that number. We think that, that is really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model. And ultimately, we're hoping given the strong start that maybe there could be some opportunity to improve on that over the balance of the year. But so far, they started strong. And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter, but some of that's going to go away over there second, third and fourth calendar quarters for their year. And they have to do a really good job on replacing that over the balance of the year. So we feel good about the guidance we've provided. And ultimately, hopefully, that pipeline will continue to translate into incremental backlog, which could result in potentially being a little bit higher. But I think we're being prudent in terms of our guidance for PA at this point in time. So let me go through the second one first. You're exactly right, the $267 million, is a dynamic where the total consideration was reduced by the $267 million and now that $267 million flows through the P&L ultimately in the third quarter. So effectively, that dynamic is occurring. So you're right relative to how that works. Total consideration doesn't change. We're still at the \u00a31.4 billion on sterling. So note that, I think that's important to know, Andy. Second point, in terms of the guide, no, there's -- the guide is effectively -- we took the $0.09 and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong, they got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business NPA is a book-and-burn business, so they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. So back to the base business. Yes, we had good performance in Q2 and effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide is how we're able to characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021."

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. Similar to last quarter, I will discuss four notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy. Beginning with space exploration and intelligence. From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft and the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallace Flight facility located in Virginia, and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers. We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan congressional support with preliminary FY22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense based spending was up 28% in FY21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY22 as well. Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all source intelligence capability. We were awarded two exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, DCTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe. We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion Solutions for Information Technology Enterprise, or SITE III, IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget, redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from states are anticipated. Maybe the add on the competitive climate, So Joe, where we sit with regard to framework agreements that we've had, not just in the US, but stimulus is also affecting the UK and Australia and other locations around the world, are pretty ideal for where those monies would flow. So if you look at transportation frameworks, water frameworks that we've been on for several years, it's going to position us extremely well. And those are pretty secure because the money needs to flow pretty quickly. So coupled with the fact that we're on these higher end services, I think the competitive climate we stand will fair well. Jerry, I think the client engagements and the client stickiness call it, is solid. And so yes, the size of the engagement might be different than we would have historically seen at kind of Jacobs. But the longevity with their clients really just from the technology and the value they're contributing shows the future to be really bright. So we're feeling very positive. I think that the adjacent and knock on effects of what we're doing, not just exploration but how that feeds into intelligence is strong. If you look at the Mango One launch, the application centered around intelligence but also the application into 5G and other commercial applications is going to continue to broaden markets that we haven't had exposed to in the past. So other things that Steve said is really expanding that aperture on the applications. Yes, I think it's just staying on that digital theme, Steve, and we're looking at it both externally and internally. So for example, rationalizing our internal platforms on how we transact our business is going to have derivative benefits. Kevin's talked about it before with regards to operating leverage. And then externally, if you have to point to one, it really is around the digitization of our offering. So autonomous design, machine learning, looking at the digitization of the global delivery model and then how that can provide value solutions in a more efficient way, so it's a big . Michael, let me kind of unpack both sides of that. On the semiconductor side, I'm not sure if you asked about that or life sciences, it is global. It's probably more focused in on the US for us right now. When I say US, US clients as well as agent clients that are building in the US. You're even seeing it in the stimulus bill with President Biden's efforts in order to increase that capacity here on US soil as global supply chains have been kind of rejiggered. And so we do see that having a positive effect on Jacobs. I don't know if it's necessarily six months. It's probably got a longer tail on that and eased through the next 12 to 24 months, but that's a strong trend. And it's both not only on the logic side but it's also on memory chips and some of the lower end chips that you're hearing from some of the automotive issues that are going around. Online sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us, and that is the rebalancing of the product portfolio, all of this attention that's been placed on vaccines, specifically around the coronavirus. Great development that's happening within the oncology world. And as I said in the remarks, that's driving a real need for contract manufacturing, probably like nothing we've seen in history because of the volumes that are needed and the speed to market around these new therapies. So overall, really, really solid picture for at least the next couple of years."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supplies. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic, including, for example, our operations in the Philippines. Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return. As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security. We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong first half performance and the benefit from the PA consulting investment, we're raising our full year guidance ranges. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.2 billion to $1.27 billion versus our previous outlook of $1.075 billion to $1.155 billion. We expect adjusted EPS to now be in a range of $6 to $6.30 versus our previous outlook of $5.30 to $6. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, with optimism building around a major US stimulus package and significant opportunities related to climate change and digital modernization, we are positioned for strong revenue and double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. So let me just start with a couple of high level comments, Joe, is that the timing is something that we expect to -- we're not going to see the final decision and what this is all about until probably later this summer, could go into early fall. And so we'll start to see momentum pick up sometime in 2022. But I think the strategic driver for us is that whether you look at the Biden proposal or even the Republican also, which was somewhat watered down and we expect it to be somewhere between the two is that it's significant growth, there's going to be a lot of opportunity for a lot of the companies out there. And I think for us being a margin focused company and seeing the evolution of what we've been doing over the last few years is the two things for us is that as there's a need for resources, we have the best global integrated capability to bring the resources to the right place and to really focus on the highest margin opportunities as that unfolds in both businesses and P&PS at CMS. Bob? We're not going to provide any guidance relative to 2022 at this point in time. But I think we're feeling pretty good about the developing momentum. So we certainly, as we work through it, I think it's important to note Steve's comments relative to we're not going to go after everything. We're going to go after those things that ultimately give us the best margin potential. So I think we're excited about what \u201822 can ultimately look to and certainly, I would suggest it's probably not going down. Just to build on the other part of your question, Jerry, is PA Consulting did a really great job on positioning themselves to win in sort of COVID solutions, and Bob talked about that and still got some runway on it. But what they're also now seeing is several of there are other markets picking up and so that bodes well as some of the COVID work starts to phase out this other work phasing in. Well, just, again, maybe to start with the broader space for us is it's pretty wide ranging for us. As we have always been a major player with deep space exploration and NASA being a major client for ours and we're solidly positioned there around Artemis and the research and development work they're doing around hypersonics and space architecture, et cetera. And now with the KeyW acquisition, ramping up very nicely, the whole low earth orbit, ISR, Rapid Solutions. And then you go beyond there with missile defense and some of the other aspects of space, it's become a very major market for us, specifically. Bob, around the commercial sector? We couldn't be better positioned from a standpoint of the M&A activity that's behind us. Obviously, CH2M combined with Jacobs positions us to be the major player here. And by the way that we can't keep getting to remind everyone, one of the biggest acquisitions in our industry going very well. When you look at what we paid for that compared to what it's generating today, extremely attractive financially but obviously, Jamie, helps us position to be a big winner. But then you have on top of that the PA Consulting acquisition, which now provides end-to-end capability from front end consulting all the way through delivery and ultimately things like O&M, et cetera. So from a climate change extent. So as far as other M&A, we're going to continue to look at things that can move us up the food chain from a margin standpoint, possibly some geographic expansion. But as far as the US infrastructure stimulus opportunity, I think we're extremely well positioned with the organic capability we have today. And on the climate change side, when you look at the $5 billion, it's really wide ranging of what we're in. But as you look at the growth going forward, it's going to be everything from how do we help our clients adapt and mitigate. So whether it's C-level rise, or flooding, or bush fires and droughts, the whole energy transition equation moving away from fossil fuels into clean energy, and that's both working with our government and private clients, eveyone is looking to reduce their carbon footprint, that's where we come in around the whole decarbonization and eliminating or reducing greenhouse gases and then things like natural resource stewardship, which is critical across the globe. It's a global opportunity. We're positioned well as an end to end solutions provider and bringing some unique tools and innovation, because it's going to require digital transformation to achieve these type of climate change transformative expectations by our clients. When you talk about margin initiatives, it's been both organic and inorganic. One of the things we're extremely proud of around our Critical Mission Solutions line of business is all the acquisitions that recent acquisitions, KeyW, Wood Nuclear, Buffalo Group, they're all performing very well, strong first half versus last first half pro forma and they're all margin accretive to our CMS line of business. And so from that standpoint, I think that's a key addition to our margin enhancement. But then it really goes back to what we were talking about earlier to our whole global integrated delivery profile to not only bring the best resources but be more efficient in certain aspects of the whole delivery model and much more around the whole business acumen, commercial acumen side now versus several years ago and really identifying where the margin opportunities are, not just going after any business for the sake of growth. Bob, what else on that front? Chad, I think we missed the first part of your question. It sounds like it's around cyber, but can you just kind of reask it and you summarize it. We're actually in the middle of it right now and I can't speak too much into the details, but the events I think that you were highlighting over the weekend, we are engaged on that, too. Kind of the portal there on leveraging it in the private sector has been our strong heritage also in the private sector with the other portfolio offerings that we have. Specifically, if it's in the hydrocarbon space, we did quite a bit of environmental remediation and regulatory work in that space. Using that as the portal in order to bring in our cyber expertise, whether it'd be OT or IT has been a strong initiative and we're seeing some traction there, not just in an emergency situation but also as a part of cyber hardening of these companies. And then in other private sectors that we have, whether it'd be facility, specialized manufacturing. All those things that we do for the government, the road map points to our ability to leverage our longstanding private sector relationships and do the same. So you'll see more of that coming in the coming months and coming quarters. So a couple of comments, Michael, first one on on the margin front or the percent of revenue that SG&A represents. We're still in a good spot relative to historical numbers. So don't think of this as being something that's going to be a big challenge for us, but we do find it necessary to make these investments. I think the next comment I would make is that's what Focus 2023 is really all about to ensure that we get improved operating leverage through the process and system enhancements that we're talking about, which will allow us as the growth dynamic begins to accelerate, which we talked about, assuming it's going to happen in 2022, and that's going to be really important for two reasons, one, to get the operating leverage. But I think the other way to think about it is if we can get that growth and afford ourselves the same ability not to hire at the same level that we've had to in past growth spurts, that's going to be really, really strong for us. So there obviously is a war for talent. And to the extent that we're going to be able to supply that incremental growth with less headcount having to be added to support it that's going to be a big positive for us. There's more than we intended. In fact, what we've done -- so I mean the headline is the level of engagement and the collaborative pursuits that we have is strong. And just to quantify, we kind of thought that we would be in that maybe 40 to 50 type collaborative pursuits that would have 12 to 18 month gestation period to them, that number's -- probably double that right now, and we're getting heavily engaged and we see that getting even stronger as travel restrictions come down and we're able to jointly see clients together as well. So very strong and I think it's contributing to our optimism as we look forward. We've talked about it for several quarters. We're exiting two low margin large contracts. The Hanford contract and the classified contract that we've spoken about before. When you exclude those two, are critical and you exclude the acquisitions, our base business is growing. I think it's somewhere in the 8% range. And then you add on top of that, obviously, the benefit of the acquisitions that are continuing to ramp up with that on a year-over-year basis more than our -- some of them weren't on our numbers. So I think that we're feeling good about everything that we've talked about with regard to the -- where we're aligned with the growth trends, even though there's a flat defense budget. The things like Space Intelligence and hypersonics, and several of the other items that we mentioned are actually growing nicely. And so there's a lot of shift in funding. Even the DoD climate change initiatives to modernize their infrastructure in the Department of Defense that's helping us. And so overall, we're very pleased with the revenue growth in Critical Mission Solutions. Thank you. So as I close the call, our thoughts are with the people, our people in India, including our Jacobs colleagues, and we'll continue to support them in dealing with the current significant challenges of the pandemic. Looking to the future, we're excited about our strong performance and our solid foundation that provides Jacobs as we develop our new strategy and chart an existing future together, and an exciting future together. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. During this presentation, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to Slide 2 of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results to prior-period on a pro forma basis. See Slide 2 for more information on the calculations of these pro forma measures. Our pro forma comparisons current and prior-period excludes the results of the Woods Nuclear business which closed in March 2020 and Buffalo Group which closed in November of 2020. We provide historical pro forma results in the Appendix of the investor presentation. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we're making against our strategy and reviewing our commitments to ESG and sustainability solutions. Bob will then review our performance by line of business and Kevin will provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by an update on our Focus 2023 integration efforts, as well as a review of our balance sheet to cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide a detailed, our updated outlook along with the closing remarks, and then we'll open the call for your questions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks, Jon, and thanks, everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and strategy update. It's been about a year since the pandemic started, and we hope everyone is safe and healthy, as COVID-19 continues to impact all facets of our daily lives. At Jacobs, in addition to keeping our people safe, we're continuing to support national governments and industry and their production and distribution of critical vaccines. Turning to Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results, it's important to review our strategy which is foundational to an investment in Jacobs. We believe the transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created a compelling multi-decade investment opportunity for our current and potential shareholders based on three key tenets. First, we have transformed our culture, aligned around a common purpose of creating a connected sustainable world underpinned by strong values of we do things right. We challenge the acceptance, we aim higher, and we live inclusion [ph]. This culture permeates through our more than 50,000 people, the solutions we deliver for our clients, and the engagement in our communities where we live and work. Our purpose-driven culture has also enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions, while also staying focused on our long-term vision of being a technology-enabled solutions provider. Second, we have a portfolio of solutions aligned to a diverse set of global opportunities such as space exploration, cyber readiness, climate change, and modernizing and digitizing our infrastructure. Our thematic growth areas are global, allowing us to address them efficiently, effectively, and competitively at scale through our integrated global platform of technology, our talented resources, domain expertise, and enhanced brand awareness. Finally, our Jacobs Management team has demonstrated the ability to strategically allocate capital, including successfully executing acquisitions. Our continued focus on strategy and execution has resulted in a strong start to fiscal 2021 even while continuing to manage the headwinds from the global pandemic. First quarter net revenue increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 8%. Our backlog ended the first quarter up 11% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong momentum, we're increasing the mid-point of our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and EPS outlook. Our cash flow generation was strong during the first quarter, and our balance sheet remains healthy. In the near-term, we do expect to deploy excess cash towards paying down debt. Last quarter, we announced a strategic majority investment in PA Consulting, and we are happy to share that the transaction was overwhelmingly approved on February 4 with 99.8% of PA shareholders voted in favor of the transaction. Particularly exciting was the fact that the voluntary election for management rollover was fully subscribed and new partner hiring has also been very successful post announcement, indicating the enthusiasm and commitment of PA partners and employees about the future growth opportunity of this partnership. Confirmation of the scheme of arrangement is awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, and we expect to close the investment by the end of this current quarter. PA's performance for calendar 2020 exceeded our expectations, and their pipeline of strategic and technical consulting work continues to grow. This includes a new engagement with the UK's Department of International Trade, advising on project defense and UK supply chain resilience to underpin economic and national security. Along with reaching a key milestone with the National Institute for Health Research, where they completed a UK public sector first delivery of Google Cloud Search to upgrade research platforms. Once we complete the transaction, we expect significant benefit for the clients of our firms driven by the complementary solutions offering of PA and Jacobs. Now looking further into fiscal 2021 and beyond, we believe Jacobs has a compelling organic growth opportunity and as appropriate, we will further accelerate that growth through thoughtful strategic acquisitions that offer a higher return versus our alternatives of repurchasing shares of Jacobs. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to review some recent ESG actions. As a company we're committed to delivering results to all our stakeholders, our employees, our clients, our investors, and our communities. Delivering on this includes our commitment to our sustainability strategy called PlanBeyond and our Climate Action Plan launched last year. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a net zero carbon, including 100% renewable energy for our operations in 2020. And our carbon reduction targets have been formally approved by the science-based targets initiative. The climate agenda will continue to be front and center in 2021 with the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 being held in November. In support, Jacobs announced our Pledge to Action, a campaign inviting our clients and suppliers around the globe to take measurable actions to tackle climate change before the opening of COP26, and we're also leveraging the power of our Jacobs people in making a positive impact. We launched our Climate Countdown Challenge where employees can join a new mission each month to tackle the climate crisis. Through both of these initiatives, we hope to raise awareness, inspire, and motivate individuals and companies and demonstrate the collective power of organizations taking actions now to make an impact for generations to come. Moving to Slide 6, at Jacobs, we intend to lead from the front in the transformation to a net zero economy. In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, Climate change remains the major global driver for ecological, social, and economic disruption, impacting every person, community, business, and governments around the world. It's also a major disruptor advancing technology-enabled innovation and sustainable business models for addressing decarbonization, the global energy transition and resource scarcity. Jacobs is uniquely positioned to support our clients and communities in developing and deploying solutions and technologies across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including renewable energy and clean power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and energy storage, green buildings, sustainable transport, circular economy, carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as adaptation and resilience for all facets of infrastructure. This includes developing technology solutions, like our recently announced launch of Jacobs Travel Service Optimization solution, which transforms the home-to-school travel experience for special educational needs and disabilities children and young people. This solution combines our deep domain knowledge with the latest advances in data analytics to determine the most efficient ride sharing experience, while supporting decarbonization and our long-term transition to a net zero economy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to Slide 7, to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high-levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workforce and clients have addressed the primary challenges of physical distancing, and continue to execute on our contracts, regardless of work location at approximately 95% of normal operating levels. Total CMS backlog is at $9.7 billion representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 4% on a pro forma basis. The CMS strategy is focused on both revenue growth and margin expansion by aligning to our go-to-market strategy towards critical national priority of digital monetization, strategic data utilization, lower orbit satellites, hypersonics, and cyber. I'll discuss each in greater detail. Beginning with digital modernization trends, our global government clients faced the current task of transforming their digital stack of information, communications and security systems in order to maintain their national security. We were on this transformation journey with our clients as we develop and operate their next-generation digital systems. In December, we cleared the protest period on the Navy Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management Award, and we were awarded another new digital modernization project for the Army's Intelligence and Security Command. In addition to digital modernization, a second key growth driver for our business is the DOD's increased focus on strategic data utilization. The DOD is becoming a data centric organization, combining edge computing with data intelligence and analysis at hyperspeed and scale. That is considered a strategic asset similar to the priority given to weapon systems and is increasingly central to Warfighter advantage in and out of theater. As an example, our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance team was recently awarded a feat on the 10-year $950 million Ceiling IDIQ to provide various unmanned aircraft solutions and satellite payload services for the Air Force's Advanced Battlefield Management System. ABMS allows a Joint Force to use cutting edge methods and technologies to rapidly collect, analyze and share intelligence information and make decisions in real time. Moving on to low earth orbit satellites. These satellites play a key role in advanced communications, military reconnaissance, intelligence, and other imaging applications. Jacobs began a new era in advanced stage radar payloads with the successful launch of its Mango One satellite. Our approach enables government and commercial customers to proliferate space-based sensors to see in the dark and through clouds to provide near continuous monitoring, gathering valuable actionable intelligence in the ground, sea, air and space domain. And now on to Hypersonic. Hypersonic offensive and defensive weapons technology is unquestionably one of the highest priorities for government clients. Jacobs through its decades supporting the Air Force and NASA is a clear leader in hypersonic solution. During the quarter, CMS was awarded a hypersonic test cell contract from the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Complex to transform this facility into a unique large scale clean air variable Mach number test facility with extended runtime capability. A final trend is to discuss cyber. The recent SolarWinds Sunburst advanced persistent attack continues to make headlines giving the sophistication and dwelling time. In fact the Biden administration has requested a $9 billion plus increase in spending for cyber and modernization. And, as mentioned on our call last quarter, the British government also approved its largest military investment increase in 30 years by \u00a316.5 billion or 10% per year over the next four years in defense areas, including cybersecurity. CMS in cyber and intelligence business has grown over the past several years to more than 3,300 professionals today. Part of our growth strategy is to continue to add adjacent capabilities and customers. The Buffalo Group acquisition which closed in November, posted strong initial performance and is a catalyst for achieving immediate scale and deep client access with a strong majority of the U.S. intelligence agencies and combatant commands. In summary, we continue to see strong structural demands for our solutions. Supporting this, the CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 months qualifying new business pipelines remaining above $30 billion, including over $10 billion in-source selection and an increasing margin profile. Now on to Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Last quarter, we conveyed optimism around our balanced portfolio and our ability to remain resilient through economic and geopolitical volatility. This is demonstrated by strong P&L performance in the quarter, as well as 9% year-over-year backlog growth. After a steady pipeline in 2020, and momentum in government funding strategies, timing remains uncertain in our focused geographies, such as in the U.S. and UK. We anticipate further improvement to our pipeline as governments solidify their budget. I'll discuss four trends impacting the macroeconomic environment in our sectors, all of which we\u2019re well-positioned to capitalize on. First, climate change and decarbonization of the economy, private sustainability and resilience for public and private entity; second, economic influence for long-term job growth and economic relief; third, the pandemic and continued growth in health, life sciences and cloud computing; and fourth, modernization of infrastructure and the digitalization of the industry. Beginning with climate change and the decarbonization of the economy, the environmental sector is experiencing growth as government, the investment community, companies and citizens confirm their commitments to climate action, act on their decarbonization agenda, and increased focus on PFAS an emerging determinant. We generated the largest growth in this sector year-over-year and anticipate our investment in PA Consulting to further strengthen our decarbonization solutions offer. These solutions such as advising our clients on their climate action goals, developing strategy and policy, assisting in program implementation, and providing intelligent asset management are embedded in all our geographies and sectors. A great example of this is our recent win in Orange County, Florida, to develop innovative, resilient and sustainable waste management systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations, for cleaner electricity use. Recent awards for the Marinus Link Electricity Interconnector linking the States of Victoria and Tasmania in Australia and Project Connect one of the world's largest lithium ion batteries are key elements supporting Australia's renewable energy transition. In the Middle East, where we are the program manager to Expo 2020 Dubai, the sustainability pavilion known as Terra premieres this month. Leveraging our industry leading sustainability expertise, Terra is designed to be a net zero carbon driving full operations, and provides a glimpse of what is to come when Expo fully opens later this year. Next, we'll discuss economic stimulus spend aimed at long-term job growth and economic relief. In the U.S., the current administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda that aligns directly with the long-term growth of our markets. We have every reason to believe that focus will continue as the administration and Congress address COVID relief, climate change, environmental justice, resilience and the need to create long-term job growth and economic recovery through infrastructure modernization. As activity on these issues progress, we anticipate funding to support our clients projects at the federal state and local level, which we're uniquely positioned to support through long-term historical Framework Agreements. In the UK, we're well-positioned for stimulus and a leveling up agenda to rebalance the economy across the country and are supporting our clients with smart integrated solutions with tangible social, environmental and economic benefits for the communities they serve. In our Asia-Pacific geography, particularly in India, Singapore and Australia, we expect an infrastructure led economic revival around transportation and green recovery, largely centered on large scale renewables and energy to catalyze the economy over the coming years. Moving to the impact of the pandemic and continued growth in Health, Life Sciences in the cloud computing supply chain. COVID vaccine production is progressing to increase capacity and distribution as well as increased demand from contract manufacturing companies with an acute focus on biotechnology and we expect our investment in PA Consulting to strengthen our end-to-end delivery in the sector. Demand for cloud computing continues to drive our data center business globally. We remain agile and are diversifying our client base to adjust to market trends and semiconductor manufacturing, building on established relationships and industry-leading leadership; we're in the negotiations with several new life sciences and electronics projects. In the built environment sector, we're gaining momentum with our clients focused on the global healthcare crisis. We were selected to lead the programming initial engineering efforts for a new campus for the California -- University of California Davis Health Center as well as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Redevelopment in Australia, where investment in technology and physical infrastructure support new trends in virtual care. Finally, I'll talk about monetization of infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. Infrastructure monetization remains a priority investment across all sectors and geographies. Transportation continues with a heavy focus on highways and rail. We were awarded the Engineering Services Project for the Houston METRO Inner Katy bus rapid transit system, as well as the new Rapid Transit project in Southeast Asia that will enable the workforce to adapt public transport, representing another example of how we support our clients with solutions to improve sustainability of our cities and places. Water sector trends are steady with implementation of digital technology and a focus on the water energy nexus and resiliency. Using Replica, Jacobs proprietary digital twin platform, we developed a digital twin of the watershed for Las Virgenes Municipal Water District in California for the evaluation of water supply scenarios, while balancing water quality and operational resilience. In summary, the foundation of our P&P business remains strong, with our long-term client base and frameworks in place to move rapidly when government funding is solidified. Positioned extremely well for the near-term secular trends, we expected steady growth trajectory, with profitability improving as we continue to move higher on the value chain. I would now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thanks, Bob. And now turning over to Slide 9. First quarter gross revenue increased 1% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue flat, revenue for CMS increased 3% on a pro forma basis, and P&PS net revenue was down 3%. The P&PS decline was mainly attributed to slower revenue burn, although the outlook for the business remains strong with backlog up 9% year-over-year. In the near-term, we expect reported net revenue growth be flat to up slightly year-over-year, then gain additional momentum in the second half of fiscal 2021. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1% down 110 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by two factors. A tough compare from Q1 2020 that benefited from a favorable impact from lower benefit costs carried in corporate, and a higher mix of CMS revenue which carries lower gross margins, but also has a lower G&A as a percentage of revenue. CMS gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by almost 100 basis points, as we benefited from a mix of higher margin revenues from acquisitions and new business wins. P&PS gross margins saw some modest pressure in Q1 due to a higher amount of America's program management and O&M revenue. Lower consolidated G&A as a percentage of net revenue up 170 basis points year-over-year to 13.6% more than offset the gross margin impact. As it pertains to G&A, the first quarter continue to benefit from our ability to proactively manage our cost structure. The CMS mix benefit previously stated and some focused 2023 savings from lower real estate costs, lower travel and lower COVID-related employee medical costs. As we look forward, we'll continue to be disciplined in the management of our G&A cost. GAAP operating profit was $214 million and included $22 million of restructuring transaction and other charges, the majority associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $259 million, up 10% with both lines of business posting double-digit percent increases in operating profit. As a result, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $257 million and $1.96 per share and included a benefit of $0.54 driven by mark-to-market adjustments for our Worley equity stake, a $0.47 benefit related to a mark-to-market investment in AI software provider C3.ai, $0.16 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs, a $0.17 charge related to the impairment of our AWA management investment, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.41, up 17%. Let me provide some detail on our investment in AI software provider, C3.ai. In 2010, we made a small investment in the company, which recently completed an IPO. Today, our investment represents more than 750,000 shares in the company. Due to our lockup requirements surrounding our ownership, we applied a discount to the quarter-end value of our interest in the company. Resulting in the investment valued at $85 million on our quarter-end balance sheet, at today's price, our interest represents a greater than 20 times return on our original investment. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $280 million, and was up 8% year-over-year, reaching 10.3% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 times for Q1 driven by strong book-to-bill in P&PS. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to grow the CMS pipeline, both on a pro forma and reported basis. The timing of when this robust CMS pipeline will convert into backlog is weighted more towards the second half of fiscal 2021, resulting in our projected backlog exhibiting year-over-year growth for the year. The P&PS overall sales pipeline has increased as well driven by a pro-environmental Biden administration, broader potential infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. and an improving economic outlook. The exact timing of when many of these new stimulus related opportunities will convert to bookings will become clear over the coming months and will help support backlog growth for the year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. CMS operating profit was $110 million, up 22% and up 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. Improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, such as our recent NORAD win, which is now fully ramped. We also saw some additional benefits from favorable project close-outs. As we progress through fiscal 2021, we expect low-single-digit CMS reported revenue growth as we approach the one-year anniversary of the Wood Nuclear acquisition and continue to ramp new wins. More than offsetting the revenue headwind from fully transitioning of two large lower margin projects previously discussed, which account for a nearly $600 million headwind in annual revenue in 2021. Given the strategy to capture higher value businesses, vehicles acquisitions and organic efforts we will continue to expect reported and pro forma operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year. Moving to P&PS, Q1 net revenue was down 3% year-over-year driven by a lower short-term burn rate as bookings growth remained strong and backlog was up 9% year-over-year with a 1.3 times book-to-bill. We continue to see solid revenue growth in our Americas business offset by some timing-related slowdown in our advanced facilities and Europe and Middle East businesses. P&PS operating profit was up 10% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 13.7% for the quarter, up 160 basis points year-over-year driven by disciplined management of G&A costs. Looking forward, we continue to project P&PS revenue be up low-single-digits for fiscal 2021 with improving year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. We expect operating profit margin as a percentage of net revenue to moderate from Q1 levels, but still increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong operating profit growth. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $47 million for the quarter. While this figure was supported by strong cost discipline, we continue to expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year driven primarily by inflation in medical costs, enhanced employee benefits, and increases in discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. Now turning to Slide 11, I'd like updating you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integrations. We continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiative Focus 2023 that we believe will, one, lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; two, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process aligned for overall longer-term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred an additional $10 million charge in cash outflows of approximately $30 million related to our Focus 2023 initiatives. These investments were mainly related to improving the utilization of our physical spaces, deploying new tools and technologies for better efficiency in our business, and strategically leaning out the organization. Turning to our recent acquisition of The Buffalo Group, the company had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth; continue to expect that the acquisition will deliver $0.08 to $0.10, adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. Regarding PA Consulting, we're pleased with the preliminary results for calendar year 2020, which are tracking ahead of our expectations. We're also optimistic about their calendar year 2021 growth plan, and after this transaction closes later this quarter, we look forward to discussing our results and growth plan in more detail. We continue to expect $0.52 to $0.57 of adjusted EPS accretion from PA Consulting for fiscal 2022. And finally, when including all integration and restructuring initiatives, as well as the AWE charge but excluding PA Consulting, we now expect the total of approximately $100 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows in fiscal 2021. When including an additional non-recurring headwind associated with a payment of 2020 related UK VAT tax payment in the current quarter, we expect a total of approximately $150 million of one-time cash outflows in fiscal year 2021. We'll update these estimates to include PA Consulting after we close the transaction. Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the first quarter, we generated $96 million in reported free cash flow, a significant improvement versus the level seen in the last several Q1 periods, primarily a result of an improvement of three days in DSO versus a year-ago, other working capital benefits and less headwinds from cash restructuring. The strong Q1 cash flow included a net negative of $44 million of one-time costs associated with Focus 2020 restructuring and other items. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $837 million and a gross debt of $1.8 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley and C3ai equity. Treating the Worley and C3ai equity as cash our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.4 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During our current fiscal second quarter, we finalized a new delayed draw term loan related to our PA Consulting investment. Post PA close, we expect our balance sheet to have continued financial flexibility. However, we'll be prudent to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment over the short-term. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide number 13.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks, Kevin. Now, let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong start to the fiscal year, we're raising the low-end of our previous guidance ranges. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be in a range of $1.075 billion to $1.155 billion versus our previous outlooks of $1.055 billion to $1.155 billion. And we expect adjusted EPS to now be in a range of $5.30 to $6 versus our previous outlook of $5.20 to $6. It is important to note that our guidance does not include any benefit from the PA Consulting investment, which we expect to close by the end of fiscal second quarter. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, as we benefit from our Focus 2023 initiatives, as well as potential infrastructure related stimulus and a strong alignment to a diverse set of large secular growth opportunities. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bob, you talked a little bit about the Mango launch. Can you just speak to kind of what that now allows you to do in order to maybe more effectively market and sell that capability? And then can you just update us on the pipeline of opportunities related to that technology across the government to the extent you can?\nBob Pragada: Sure, Joe. So on the first, we're really excited about what Mango One brings to us. So it's a heavy payload, low earth orbit satellite, that's ours. And we invested in this, and it's now in space gathering data, it is kind of a right of entry to some of the higher-end, both intelligence agencies as well as other application platforms. And it's going to put us in a really unique position for some of the -- not only ongoing pursuits but even for offerings that come in the future. So I'd say that, the programs and projects that we've talked about Project M and all kinds of other tropical fruits that we refer to these programs by, it puts us in a very much differentiated position to further strengthen our win ratio. There's only a few that happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess my first question relates to the strong margin performance that you saw in P&PS. So I'm just wondering, how much of that is sort of project mix versus potential short-term, lower discretionary costs, how sustainable that is? And then I guess my longer-term question is while the margins in CMS are improving, there's still a big gap between CMS and P&PS, I'm just wondering over what time can the gap between the two segment margins, narrow more? Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: So Steve, you want me to take that?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, go ahead, Kevin.\nKevin Berryman: Yes, look Jamie, thanks for the question. First thing is on the P&PS margin profile, we actually saw a good solid gross margin performance, but really the fundamental margin profile driven primarily by the very disciplined management of our G&A costs. Of course some of that has been driven already by some of the work that we did, when we announced some of the activities relative to our reduction in footprint on real estate, some of the travel reductions that we've been doing. But there's also been fairly significant actions -- proactive actions taken in terms of managing our labor costs appropriately relative to the current situation regarding the pandemic. We're closely monitoring that. And as we think about how our business starts to come back, which is fully anticipated over the course of this year, some of those costs will come back into play as it relates to the business, but that's going to be associated with higher gross profit as well. So ultimately, margin profile will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level as Q1 but certainly well above what we would have expected to see in 2020, what we did see in 2020, so feeling very good about that opportunity. In terms of the margin profile between the two businesses, we've said that we believe actual margin profile can improve on both sides with both of the businesses. And consequently, a big focus in 2021 is starting to reduce in a more tangible way the margin profile difference between the two businesses, and we've been communicating that CMS margins should be a strong improvement this year. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to play out over the balance of 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.\nJosh Sullivan: Just a question on the free cash generation and congratulations on moving the needle there. Just to the comments before about kind of a mix shift moving around. I mean, is there anything we should be thinking about any turmoil in the DSOs? I mean, is there anything that we should be thinking about as far as the free cash flow profile while you do that mix shift up to kind of more high-value work?\nKevin Berryman: In general, I would say that the opportunity for us to continue to drive DSO improvements from existing levels, we believe that this remains an opportunity, it's tough work as I've always said relative to the ability to continue to drive that number down. Very pleased with the work in Q4 of last year, very pleased with where we ended Q1 of fiscal 2021. And we believe that there's an opportunity to continue to drive that down and that our mix of projects won't necessarily, ultimately result in that underlying trend longer term. So, we still feel good about that, still got a lot of work to do, but we feel good about the cash flow generative nature of the portfolio going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJerry Revich: Steve, I'm wondering if you could talk about your M&A pipeline as it stands today considering the cost reduction efforts and the upcoming integration with PA Consulting. How active are you folks in terms of scouting for opportunities at this point and based on the lean work that you're doing, does that expand the opportunity set in terms of the cost reduction opportunities you might have as you look at the next set of companies in the pipeline whether it's 2021, 2022 event? Can you just flush that out for us, please. Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Great. So we are a company that is always active and making sure we're exploring all opportunities globally, and we're going to continue to do that. We have recently executed on some acquisitions with The Buffalo Group and PA Consulting most recently, and Wood Nuclear is fairly new. So, for us our top priority is to execute on those recent acquisitions and demonstrate continued success. We feel proud of what we achieved with a major one of CH2M back in 2017 and have successfully executed and exceeded expectations, and so we want to focus on that right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the next months, our primary capital deployment is going to be to pay down debt. However, when we look at the pipeline of opportunities in our strategy, there are several bolt-on opportunities even within PA Consulting. When we think about what we have initiated there coming together with PA, they've been a very successful firm in doing bolt-on acquisitions. It\u2019s helped them create value, and we want to continue to support that, and together we think that there's going to be some real interesting things that we can do in that whole consulting arena, which is higher margin and higher value business. And then of course, anything that we can do to just accelerate our digital modernization, strategic data utilization as we have done with the series of cyber acquisitions, including most recently KeyW and The Buffalo Group, and so we'll continue to be active on the government services space, and any other bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our P&PS business as well. And, the final thing I'll say is there's some geographic expansion opportunities when you looked at our mix of business, yes, it really is still majority -- the majority of our revenue comes from the U.S. and UK and then it drops down significantly from there. And so, we think there's some great geographic expansion initiatives over the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And just trying to get a read on P&PS, given the lower revenue burn, but strong backlog. Bob, you talked about still seeing some funding in COVID-related uncertainty out there, but the trends you mentioned especially more focus on climate change, digitization, stimulus, seem to be overwhelming that uncertainty at least in backlog. So maybe you can give us more color, what was the biggest driver of backlog growth in Q1, and especially if we do see some U.S. stimulus here, is it possible to backlog growth continues at that high-single-digit rate you saw even accelerate from here?\nBob Pragada: Yes. So maybe -- Andy, I'll address that first and then go back to the year-on-year performance. We do, so the short answer is, yes. The pipeline that we capitalize on in Q1, the dialogue in anticipation of stimulus continues with our clients. And so where we fit in the value chain, where we would be in the initial concept work scoping, looking at what potential optionality are around and objectives will be different structure project, I see those continuing. As well as the opportunities we're seeing were driven by the pandemic, but in the healthcare and in the data center and semiconductor manufacturing world. So I think those remain strong. As far as what we see coming out of the funding, I really -- I'm sorry, the year-on-year piece, I'd really kind of point to the sustainability of our work due to the framework and the position we have with our clients. So, yes, there has been a bit of a revenue decline, but it wasn't a drop off the cliff. And we were able to -- there was a bit of a drop in Q3 of last year and we've been able to sustain it. Remember, comparison to last year, quarter-on-quarter -- I'm sorry, year-on-year, we weren't in the pandemic. And so, I think that flatness is what we're seeing as far as the revenue piece and looking to see -- looking at product turnaround as the backlog converts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fisher: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you just talk a little bit about the increase in restructuring from I think it was $80 million to $100 million plan for the year, why did it increase kind of what's the cadence from here? I think it will certainly be a milestone when restructuring generally becomes immaterial, but I'm just wondering if they do that as long as there is going to be some M&A activity should there be some ongoing restructuring?\nKevin Berryman: Yes, thanks. Appreciate the question; look on the number going from the 80 till 100. That's effectively driven by the AWE item that is a non-cash charge, we highlighted that that there was a current evaluation that was occurring during our Q4 call, you might recall. And so we basically had to write-down our AWE investment that was made several years ago, so no real difference in terms of restructuring. Of course, we have not yet included any of the dynamics associated with PA; there will be some costs obviously there. And that will be further clarified after we actually have PA come on into the full of hopefully expected by the end of this quarter. So no real fundamental change at this particular point in time other than the AWE charge, non-cash charge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nChad Dillard: So within your greater than $30 billion project pipeline, I think there are a couple of large projects you guys talked about in the past on the weapon sustainment and ISR side. Can you give us your latest thoughts on these [ph] what timing there has been any change in competitive landscape, the positioning? And then also, can you talk about a certain level of design activity that you're seeing globally if they acquire your private P&PS business. What are you seeing accelerating growth versus maybe some stall in the recovery? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Chad, maybe I'll start.\nBob Pragada: Here in Bob. Chad, I may start on the latter.\nSteve Demetriou: When we talk about the P&Ps business, clearly what's driving our pipeline are the things that Bob talked about initially, and that is the whole digital modernization and strategic data utilization across all of our clients and buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities. The whole climate change arena is clearly going to be ramping up with the change in administration in the U.S., but just a global priorities that's going on there. And look when we talk about climate change, the things we're already doing in SolarWinds and now hydrogen is kicking in and the energy storage with batteries and the whole resiliency strength that we have which we've been doing for the last several years around, flooding and sea-level rise and a whole host of other things pretty fast, et cetera. And then the whole opportunity around the advanced facilities business with regard to what the pandemic is accelerated and in the life sciences business and the electronics business because on the life sciences side, there is now a pent-up demand on non-COVID activities, obviously the priority is probably vaccines and therapeutics, but oncology, diabetes, emerging cell in gene therapy and also the fact that there is more need for capacity, so there is a huge contract whole manufacturing opportunity that's now presenting itself. And then the whole healthcare side with hospitals and what's going on globally there. And then the electronics with the future of work with everything from 5G to data centers to the semiconductor, there is clearly a wave of growth in that business as well. So -- and then on top of all that is what countries are doing around the world starting with the U.S. around stimulating their economies, coming out of the pandemic. Clearly we're seeing positive momentum in the U.S. Though we expect to see something soon with this first COVID relief package, but we're anxious to see what comes out over the coming months in the whole infrastructure stimulus, which will benefit Jacobs, it's upside. This is 2022 and beyond when we talk about infrastructure stimulus out here is not dependent on it. And then from a standpoint of UK, very positive momentum in many of the other countries are also kicking in with their infrastructure initiatives, economic initiatives. So real positive momentum on the P&PS. So, Bob do you want to comment on the backlog on CMS?\nBob Pragada: Yes. We are -- within the next 12 months. I think I mentioned that $10 billion is in source selection. Specifically around, I think the question was around ISR, and our tack on cyber to that. Now with The Buffalo Group and with the kind of our positioning in that space now both in cyber as well as intelligence would it be the intelligent commands or defense or in even the joint commands, the co-concept on. We are now in the majority of them with increased skill sets across multi-domain. So we see those awards coming in. They might not be as large and longer in duration, these jobs traditionally are now in the current form aren't. But we see those continue to flow in from Q3 and beyond with higher margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: There has been a surge in investor interest for space exploration and space reconnaissance, are you able to quantify the size of Jacobs' space portfolio as it relate to NASA, the intelligence community and the Missile Defense Agency and on this note, can you review what role Jacobs is expected to play for the Artemis Moon Program? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Space is -- has been a legacy, strengthen and an important part of our revenue going back to the -- the long history we have with NASA, where we're NASA's leading solutions provider across essentially all of their sites and so that's our foundation. And then with the KeyW acquisition and some of the other initiatives that we've done both organically and bolted-on is that first of all, low-earth space intelligence that Bob just talked about that we're very excited about most of that is a very highly classified work. So that's now going to -- we believe is going to be a very high growth add-on to our whole space initiatives. So -- and then would be adjacency work that comes with our intelligence work and relationship with the space community is the whole hypersonics area that it's going to be something that is big for us starting in the sort of the consulting research development and then getting into some of the big programs there. So well over a $1 billion today and one that we expect high growth walk going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSean Eastman: I think nice start to the year. I'm just curious, a lot of companies are talking about digital data. I'm just curious as we think about Focus 2023, what do you think Jacobs is doing better than the competition as we think about digital, and data effectively moving the company up the value chain?\nBob Pragada: Well, let me start with kind of how we've gotten to where we are because Jacobs has always been a company that has been working on digital smart initiatives going back to the work that we've done with NASA and others. But when you look at the last several years, the CH2M acquisition and was the combination has really accelerated our capability, the things that CH2M brought like digital twins that we talked about and several other capabilities. And then we go into the whole strategy that we unleashed over the last several years, around the Jacobs Connected Enterprise and now taking us to a higher level in the culture that we put in. The talent attraction that we've had a very focused talent attraction on making sure that we bring in all the subject matter expertise and the digital capabilities just -- it's been impressive and really tapping into the -- some of the most innovative companies to bring some of their talent to Jacobs. And then the last two big steps have been the rebranding to really make our clients more aware, a lot of the stuff we were doing for certain clients in one part of Jacobs, mostly rest of our clients didn't really know that we have actually capability and -- and that brand initiative that we launched last year was a key step. And then PA Consulting is now going to take it to a whole new level around the end-to-end solutions that we can provide. When you look at the IP that we have, it's pretty impressive across the board, and then the technology hubs that we focus on geospatial productive analytics, cyber, Internet-of-Things, intelligent asset management. And when you put it all together, the real differentiation for Jacobs is that we have both the domain knowledge, decades of experience working on all of these things, and markets and clients and we have typically -- state-of-the-art technology skillset in bringing digital solutions. So when you put that together, we feel like we're in that unique differentiated position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen. This one for Kevin. Wondering do you have anymore 20 baggers in that asset portfolio of yours. Appreciate to know that, but more seriously, could you remind us when PA closes, what the balance sheet metrics on net debt, cash, leverage ratios? And how you're thinking about the current ownership of Worley and C3.ai relative to your deleveraging opportunities or your cash needs going forward?\nKevin Berryman: Thanks, Mike for the question. I think with a lot of the work that Steve just alluded to in our strategy over the last several years has positioned us very, very well from the balance sheet perspective to be able to execute against the PA transaction. Our actual net debt is probably in the neighborhood once we close, is probably in the area of two times. So, still quite nice in terms of our position. We still have substance of levels of cash at that particular point in time. So we have some flexibility as it relates to that. Our gross debt levels will be a little bit higher. So our idea is that we will kind of in the very short-term, we do some of that gross debt level with incremental cash generation that we're going to be seeing about. We feel like we still have a really good flexibility as it relates to how we will look to deploy capital not in -- and then necessarily in immediate term, but certainly as we progress through the next few months and into later 2021, we'll be able to have some greater levels of flexibility there. So really quite well-positioned relative to our debt structure even after the amount of fund that are going to be paid out it's appropriately -- it's approximately about $1.8 billion. So we'll be doing well, even with that in terms of our leverage factors. Relative to the other equity matters, we said that these are good strategic investments and that we'll continue to think about what that means longer term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Feniger: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'm just curious on your mix in the growth prospects going forward. Basically, over the next two to three years, do you feel like more of your growth is coming from P&PS, with the infrastructure, environmental, or advanced facilities or is it mostly coming from CMS? And lastly, just to be clear, do you need a big infrastructure package to pass to reach your double-digit growth objectives in 2020? Is that critical to hit that 2020 and beyond target you guys laid out? Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: So you want me to go, guys, first?\nBob Pragada: Yes, go ahead, Kev.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, the guidance that we've provided, it doesn't assume anything as it relates to a major infrastructure there. There certainly seems to be some incremental momentum there and our view, however, is that we will start to see an ability to start to see incremental momentum in the back half of 2021, and certainly, the sustainability comment that Bob had made is important because of the particular stimulus package that's being considered right now provides that opportunity to do so. I think if you combine it all together with Focus 2023, and our continued efforts to drive the effectiveness across the globe and with the continuation of an improving economic picture, we still think there is an ability to have great growth in 2022 and beyond. And that would be double-digit obviously. If there is a large infrastructure built, that would be augmenting some of those numbers. I think as it relates to both CMS and PPS, with P&PS, we feel good about the growth prospects of both of the business long term. Both are aligned with really strong growth trends, critical mission areas as outlined by Bob, and then of course People & Places aligned the secular long-term growth trend. So we feel pretty good about the growth algorithm that's facing us in terms of both of the businesses.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDan Charney: Hey guys, this is Dan on for Gautam Khanna. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one here. Do you have the CMS book-to-bill number excluding the acquired backlog from Buffalo?\nBob Pragada: Yes, it's about a little over 1.05, 1.06 to include Wood.\nDan Charney: Okay.\nOperator: There are no further --\nBob Pragada: It's one time. It is one time, even without Wood.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, and it's over 1, even without Wood. I'm sorry.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call over to Steve Demetriou for any closing comments.\nSteve Demetriou: All right, thank you. In conclusion, our Jacob's people drive our performance. And this year more than ever, their commitment, creativity, and perseverance was our differentiator. We've chosen to honor their spirit in our integrated Annual Report for 2020, which we launched two weeks ago. I encourage you to visit the Investor page of our website to read the report and explore some of the stories of accomplishment for our clients and our communities in furthering our strong culture. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And now turning over to Slide 9. First quarter gross revenue increased 1% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue flat, revenue for CMS increased 3% on a pro forma basis, and P&PS net revenue was down 3%. The P&PS decline was mainly attributed to slower revenue burn, although the outlook for the business remains strong with backlog up 9% year-over-year. In the near-term, we expect reported net revenue growth be flat to up slightly year-over-year, then gain additional momentum in the second half of fiscal 2021. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1% down 110 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by two factors. A tough compare from Q1 2020 that benefited from a favorable impact from lower benefit costs carried in corporate, and a higher mix of CMS revenue which carries lower gross margins, but also has a lower G&A as a percentage of revenue. CMS gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by almost 100 basis points, as we benefited from a mix of higher margin revenues from acquisitions and new business wins. P&PS gross margins saw some modest pressure in Q1 due to a higher amount of America's program management and O&M revenue. Lower consolidated G&A as a percentage of net revenue up 170 basis points year-over-year to 13.6% more than offset the gross margin impact. As it pertains to G&A, the first quarter continue to benefit from our ability to proactively manage our cost structure. The CMS mix benefit previously stated and some focused 2023 savings from lower real estate costs, lower travel and lower COVID-related employee medical costs. As we look forward, we'll continue to be disciplined in the management of our G&A cost. GAAP operating profit was $214 million and included $22 million of restructuring transaction and other charges, the majority associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $259 million, up 10% with both lines of business posting double-digit percent increases in operating profit. As a result, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $257 million and $1.96 per share and included a benefit of $0.54 driven by mark-to-market adjustments for our Worley equity stake, a $0.47 benefit related to a mark-to-market investment in AI software provider C3.ai, $0.16 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs, a $0.17 charge related to the impairment of our AWA management investment, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.41, up 17%. Let me provide some detail on our investment in AI software provider, C3.ai. In 2010, we made a small investment in the company, which recently completed an IPO. Today, our investment represents more than 750,000 shares in the company. Due to our lockup requirements surrounding our ownership, we applied a discount to the quarter-end value of our interest in the company. Resulting in the investment valued at $85 million on our quarter-end balance sheet, at today's price, our interest represents a greater than 20 times return on our original investment. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $280 million, and was up 8% year-over-year, reaching 10.3% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 times for Q1 driven by strong book-to-bill in P&PS. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to grow the CMS pipeline, both on a pro forma and reported basis. The timing of when this robust CMS pipeline will convert into backlog is weighted more towards the second half of fiscal 2021, resulting in our projected backlog exhibiting year-over-year growth for the year. The P&PS overall sales pipeline has increased as well driven by a pro-environmental Biden administration, broader potential infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. and an improving economic outlook. The exact timing of when many of these new stimulus related opportunities will convert to bookings will become clear over the coming months and will help support backlog growth for the year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. CMS operating profit was $110 million, up 22% and up 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. Improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, such as our recent NORAD win, which is now fully ramped. We also saw some additional benefits from favorable project close-outs. As we progress through fiscal 2021, we expect low-single-digit CMS reported revenue growth as we approach the one-year anniversary of the Wood Nuclear acquisition and continue to ramp new wins. More than offsetting the revenue headwind from fully transitioning of two large lower margin projects previously discussed, which account for a nearly $600 million headwind in annual revenue in 2021. Given the strategy to capture higher value businesses, vehicles acquisitions and organic efforts we will continue to expect reported and pro forma operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year. Moving to P&PS, Q1 net revenue was down 3% year-over-year driven by a lower short-term burn rate as bookings growth remained strong and backlog was up 9% year-over-year with a 1.3 times book-to-bill. We continue to see solid revenue growth in our Americas business offset by some timing-related slowdown in our advanced facilities and Europe and Middle East businesses. P&PS operating profit was up 10% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 13.7% for the quarter, up 160 basis points year-over-year driven by disciplined management of G&A costs. Looking forward, we continue to project P&PS revenue be up low-single-digits for fiscal 2021 with improving year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. We expect operating profit margin as a percentage of net revenue to moderate from Q1 levels, but still increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong operating profit growth. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $47 million for the quarter. While this figure was supported by strong cost discipline, we continue to expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year driven primarily by inflation in medical costs, enhanced employee benefits, and increases in discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. Now turning to Slide 11, I'd like updating you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integrations. We continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiative Focus 2023 that we believe will, one, lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; two, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process aligned for overall longer-term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred an additional $10 million charge in cash outflows of approximately $30 million related to our Focus 2023 initiatives. These investments were mainly related to improving the utilization of our physical spaces, deploying new tools and technologies for better efficiency in our business, and strategically leaning out the organization. Turning to our recent acquisition of The Buffalo Group, the company had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth; continue to expect that the acquisition will deliver $0.08 to $0.10, adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. Regarding PA Consulting, we're pleased with the preliminary results for calendar year 2020, which are tracking ahead of our expectations. We're also optimistic about their calendar year 2021 growth plan, and after this transaction closes later this quarter, we look forward to discussing our results and growth plan in more detail. We continue to expect $0.52 to $0.57 of adjusted EPS accretion from PA Consulting for fiscal 2022. And finally, when including all integration and restructuring initiatives, as well as the AWE charge but excluding PA Consulting, we now expect the total of approximately $100 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows in fiscal 2021. When including an additional non-recurring headwind associated with a payment of 2020 related UK VAT tax payment in the current quarter, we expect a total of approximately $150 million of one-time cash outflows in fiscal year 2021. We'll update these estimates to include PA Consulting after we close the transaction. Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the first quarter, we generated $96 million in reported free cash flow, a significant improvement versus the level seen in the last several Q1 periods, primarily a result of an improvement of three days in DSO versus a year-ago, other working capital benefits and less headwinds from cash restructuring. The strong Q1 cash flow included a net negative of $44 million of one-time costs associated with Focus 2020 restructuring and other items. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $837 million and a gross debt of $1.8 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley and C3ai equity. Treating the Worley and C3ai equity as cash our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.4 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During our current fiscal second quarter, we finalized a new delayed draw term loan related to our PA Consulting investment. Post PA close, we expect our balance sheet to have continued financial flexibility. However, we'll be prudent to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment over the short-term. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide number 13. So Steve, you want me to take that? Yes, look Jamie, thanks for the question. First thing is on the P&PS margin profile, we actually saw a good solid gross margin performance, but really the fundamental margin profile driven primarily by the very disciplined management of our G&A costs. Of course some of that has been driven already by some of the work that we did, when we announced some of the activities relative to our reduction in footprint on real estate, some of the travel reductions that we've been doing. But there's also been fairly significant actions -- proactive actions taken in terms of managing our labor costs appropriately relative to the current situation regarding the pandemic. We're closely monitoring that. And as we think about how our business starts to come back, which is fully anticipated over the course of this year, some of those costs will come back into play as it relates to the business, but that's going to be associated with higher gross profit as well. So ultimately, margin profile will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level as Q1 but certainly well above what we would have expected to see in 2020, what we did see in 2020, so feeling very good about that opportunity. In terms of the margin profile between the two businesses, we've said that we believe actual margin profile can improve on both sides with both of the businesses. And consequently, a big focus in 2021 is starting to reduce in a more tangible way the margin profile difference between the two businesses, and we've been communicating that CMS margins should be a strong improvement this year. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to play out over the balance of 2021. In general, I would say that the opportunity for us to continue to drive DSO improvements from existing levels, we believe that this remains an opportunity, it's tough work as I've always said relative to the ability to continue to drive that number down. Very pleased with the work in Q4 of last year, very pleased with where we ended Q1 of fiscal 2021. And we believe that there's an opportunity to continue to drive that down and that our mix of projects won't necessarily, ultimately result in that underlying trend longer term. So, we still feel good about that, still got a lot of work to do, but we feel good about the cash flow generative nature of the portfolio going forward. Yes, thanks. Appreciate the question; look on the number going from the 80 till 100. That's effectively driven by the AWE item that is a non-cash charge, we highlighted that that there was a current evaluation that was occurring during our Q4 call, you might recall. And so we basically had to write-down our AWE investment that was made several years ago, so no real difference in terms of restructuring. Of course, we have not yet included any of the dynamics associated with PA; there will be some costs obviously there. And that will be further clarified after we actually have PA come on into the full of hopefully expected by the end of this quarter. So no real fundamental change at this particular point in time other than the AWE charge, non-cash charge. Thanks, Mike for the question. I think with a lot of the work that Steve just alluded to in our strategy over the last several years has positioned us very, very well from the balance sheet perspective to be able to execute against the PA transaction. Our actual net debt is probably in the neighborhood once we close, is probably in the area of two times. So, still quite nice in terms of our position. We still have substance of levels of cash at that particular point in time. So we have some flexibility as it relates to that. Our gross debt levels will be a little bit higher. So our idea is that we will kind of in the very short-term, we do some of that gross debt level with incremental cash generation that we're going to be seeing about. We feel like we still have a really good flexibility as it relates to how we will look to deploy capital not in -- and then necessarily in immediate term, but certainly as we progress through the next few months and into later 2021, we'll be able to have some greater levels of flexibility there. So really quite well-positioned relative to our debt structure even after the amount of fund that are going to be paid out it's appropriately -- it's approximately about $1.8 billion. So we'll be doing well, even with that in terms of our leverage factors. Relative to the other equity matters, we said that these are good strategic investments and that we'll continue to think about what that means longer term. So you want me to go, guys, first? Yes. Look, the guidance that we've provided, it doesn't assume anything as it relates to a major infrastructure there. There certainly seems to be some incremental momentum there and our view, however, is that we will start to see an ability to start to see incremental momentum in the back half of 2021, and certainly, the sustainability comment that Bob had made is important because of the particular stimulus package that's being considered right now provides that opportunity to do so.

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to Slide 7, to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high-levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workforce and clients have addressed the primary challenges of physical distancing, and continue to execute on our contracts, regardless of work location at approximately 95% of normal operating levels. Total CMS backlog is at $9.7 billion representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 4% on a pro forma basis. The CMS strategy is focused on both revenue growth and margin expansion by aligning to our go-to-market strategy towards critical national priority of digital monetization, strategic data utilization, lower orbit satellites, hypersonics, and cyber. I'll discuss each in greater detail. Beginning with digital modernization trends, our global government clients faced the current task of transforming their digital stack of information, communications and security systems in order to maintain their national security. We were on this transformation journey with our clients as we develop and operate their next-generation digital systems. In December, we cleared the protest period on the Navy Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management Award, and we were awarded another new digital modernization project for the Army's Intelligence and Security Command. In addition to digital modernization, a second key growth driver for our business is the DOD's increased focus on strategic data utilization. The DOD is becoming a data centric organization, combining edge computing with data intelligence and analysis at hyperspeed and scale. That is considered a strategic asset similar to the priority given to weapon systems and is increasingly central to Warfighter advantage in and out of theater. As an example, our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance team was recently awarded a feat on the 10-year $950 million Ceiling IDIQ to provide various unmanned aircraft solutions and satellite payload services for the Air Force's Advanced Battlefield Management System. ABMS allows a Joint Force to use cutting edge methods and technologies to rapidly collect, analyze and share intelligence information and make decisions in real time. Moving on to low earth orbit satellites. These satellites play a key role in advanced communications, military reconnaissance, intelligence, and other imaging applications. Jacobs began a new era in advanced stage radar payloads with the successful launch of its Mango One satellite. Our approach enables government and commercial customers to proliferate space-based sensors to see in the dark and through clouds to provide near continuous monitoring, gathering valuable actionable intelligence in the ground, sea, air and space domain. And now on to Hypersonic. Hypersonic offensive and defensive weapons technology is unquestionably one of the highest priorities for government clients. Jacobs through its decades supporting the Air Force and NASA is a clear leader in hypersonic solution. During the quarter, CMS was awarded a hypersonic test cell contract from the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Complex to transform this facility into a unique large scale clean air variable Mach number test facility with extended runtime capability. A final trend is to discuss cyber. The recent SolarWinds Sunburst advanced persistent attack continues to make headlines giving the sophistication and dwelling time. In fact the Biden administration has requested a $9 billion plus increase in spending for cyber and modernization. And, as mentioned on our call last quarter, the British government also approved its largest military investment increase in 30 years by \u00a316.5 billion or 10% per year over the next four years in defense areas, including cybersecurity. CMS in cyber and intelligence business has grown over the past several years to more than 3,300 professionals today. Part of our growth strategy is to continue to add adjacent capabilities and customers. The Buffalo Group acquisition which closed in November, posted strong initial performance and is a catalyst for achieving immediate scale and deep client access with a strong majority of the U.S. intelligence agencies and combatant commands. In summary, we continue to see strong structural demands for our solutions. Supporting this, the CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 months qualifying new business pipelines remaining above $30 billion, including over $10 billion in-source selection and an increasing margin profile. Now on to Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Last quarter, we conveyed optimism around our balanced portfolio and our ability to remain resilient through economic and geopolitical volatility. This is demonstrated by strong P&L performance in the quarter, as well as 9% year-over-year backlog growth. After a steady pipeline in 2020, and momentum in government funding strategies, timing remains uncertain in our focused geographies, such as in the U.S. and UK. We anticipate further improvement to our pipeline as governments solidify their budget. I'll discuss four trends impacting the macroeconomic environment in our sectors, all of which we're well-positioned to capitalize on. First, climate change and decarbonization of the economy, private sustainability and resilience for public and private entity; second, economic influence for long-term job growth and economic relief; third, the pandemic and continued growth in health, life sciences and cloud computing; and fourth, modernization of infrastructure and the digitalization of the industry. Beginning with climate change and the decarbonization of the economy, the environmental sector is experiencing growth as government, the investment community, companies and citizens confirm their commitments to climate action, act on their decarbonization agenda, and increased focus on PFAS an emerging determinant. We generated the largest growth in this sector year-over-year and anticipate our investment in PA Consulting to further strengthen our decarbonization solutions offer. These solutions such as advising our clients on their climate action goals, developing strategy and policy, assisting in program implementation, and providing intelligent asset management are embedded in all our geographies and sectors. A great example of this is our recent win in Orange County, Florida, to develop innovative, resilient and sustainable waste management systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations, for cleaner electricity use. Recent awards for the Marinus Link Electricity Interconnector linking the States of Victoria and Tasmania in Australia and Project Connect one of the world's largest lithium ion batteries are key elements supporting Australia's renewable energy transition. In the Middle East, where we are the program manager to Expo 2020 Dubai, the sustainability pavilion known as Terra premieres this month. Leveraging our industry leading sustainability expertise, Terra is designed to be a net zero carbon driving full operations, and provides a glimpse of what is to come when Expo fully opens later this year. Next, we'll discuss economic stimulus spend aimed at long-term job growth and economic relief. In the U.S., the current administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda that aligns directly with the long-term growth of our markets. We have every reason to believe that focus will continue as the administration and Congress address COVID relief, climate change, environmental justice, resilience and the need to create long-term job growth and economic recovery through infrastructure modernization. As activity on these issues progress, we anticipate funding to support our clients projects at the federal state and local level, which we're uniquely positioned to support through long-term historical Framework Agreements. In the UK, we're well-positioned for stimulus and a leveling up agenda to rebalance the economy across the country and are supporting our clients with smart integrated solutions with tangible social, environmental and economic benefits for the communities they serve. In our Asia-Pacific geography, particularly in India, Singapore and Australia, we expect an infrastructure led economic revival around transportation and green recovery, largely centered on large scale renewables and energy to catalyze the economy over the coming years. Moving to the impact of the pandemic and continued growth in Health, Life Sciences in the cloud computing supply chain. COVID vaccine production is progressing to increase capacity and distribution as well as increased demand from contract manufacturing companies with an acute focus on biotechnology and we expect our investment in PA Consulting to strengthen our end-to-end delivery in the sector. Demand for cloud computing continues to drive our data center business globally. We remain agile and are diversifying our client base to adjust to market trends and semiconductor manufacturing, building on established relationships and industry-leading leadership; we're in the negotiations with several new life sciences and electronics projects. In the built environment sector, we're gaining momentum with our clients focused on the global healthcare crisis. We were selected to lead the programming initial engineering efforts for a new campus for the California -- University of California Davis Health Center as well as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Redevelopment in Australia, where investment in technology and physical infrastructure support new trends in virtual care. Finally, I'll talk about monetization of infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. Infrastructure monetization remains a priority investment across all sectors and geographies. Transportation continues with a heavy focus on highways and rail. We were awarded the Engineering Services Project for the Houston METRO Inner Katy bus rapid transit system, as well as the new Rapid Transit project in Southeast Asia that will enable the workforce to adapt public transport, representing another example of how we support our clients with solutions to improve sustainability of our cities and places. Water sector trends are steady with implementation of digital technology and a focus on the water energy nexus and resiliency. Using Replica, Jacobs proprietary digital twin platform, we developed a digital twin of the watershed for Las Virgenes Municipal Water District in California for the evaluation of water supply scenarios, while balancing water quality and operational resilience. In summary, the foundation of our P&P business remains strong, with our long-term client base and frameworks in place to move rapidly when government funding is solidified. Positioned extremely well for the near-term secular trends, we expected steady growth trajectory, with profitability improving as we continue to move higher on the value chain. I would now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Sure, Joe. So on the first, we're really excited about what Mango One brings to us. So it's a heavy payload, low earth orbit satellite, that's ours. And we invested in this, and it's now in space gathering data, it is kind of a right of entry to some of the higher-end, both intelligence agencies as well as other application platforms. And it's going to put us in a really unique position for some of the -- not only ongoing pursuits but even for offerings that come in the future. So I'd say that, the programs and projects that we've talked about Project M and all kinds of other tropical fruits that we refer to these programs by, it puts us in a very much differentiated position to further strengthen our win ratio. There's only a few that happen. Yes. So maybe -- Andy, I'll address that first and then go back to the year-on-year performance. We do, so the short answer is, yes. The pipeline that we capitalize on in Q1, the dialogue in anticipation of stimulus continues with our clients. And so where we fit in the value chain, where we would be in the initial concept work scoping, looking at what potential optionality are around and objectives will be different structure project, I see those continuing. As well as the opportunities we're seeing were driven by the pandemic, but in the healthcare and in the data center and semiconductor manufacturing world. So I think those remain strong. As far as what we see coming out of the funding, I really -- I'm sorry, the year-on-year piece, I'd really kind of point to the sustainability of our work due to the framework and the position we have with our clients. So, yes, there has been a bit of a revenue decline, but it wasn't a drop off the cliff. And we were able to -- there was a bit of a drop in Q3 of last year and we've been able to sustain it. Remember, comparison to last year, quarter-on-quarter -- I'm sorry, year-on-year, we weren't in the pandemic. And so, I think that flatness is what we're seeing as far as the revenue piece and looking to see -- looking at product turnaround as the backlog converts. Here in Bob. Chad, I may start on the latter. Yes. We are -- within the next 12 months. I think I mentioned that $10 billion is in source selection. Specifically around, I think the question was around ISR, and our tack on cyber to that. Now with The Buffalo Group and with the kind of our positioning in that space now both in cyber as well as intelligence would it be the intelligent commands or defense or in even the joint commands, the co-concept on. We are now in the majority of them with increased skill sets across multi-domain. So we see those awards coming in. They might not be as large and longer in duration, these jobs traditionally are now in the current form aren't. But we see those continue to flow in from Q3 and beyond with higher margin. Well, let me start with kind of how we've gotten to where we are because Jacobs has always been a company that has been working on digital smart initiatives going back to the work that we've done with NASA and others. But when you look at the last several years, the CH2M acquisition and was the combination has really accelerated our capability, the things that CH2M brought like digital twins that we talked about and several other capabilities. And then we go into the whole strategy that we unleashed over the last several years, around the Jacobs Connected Enterprise and now taking us to a higher level in the culture that we put in. The talent attraction that we've had a very focused talent attraction on making sure that we bring in all the subject matter expertise and the digital capabilities just -- it's been impressive and really tapping into the -- some of the most innovative companies to bring some of their talent to Jacobs. And then the last two big steps have been the rebranding to really make our clients more aware, a lot of the stuff we were doing for certain clients in one part of Jacobs, mostly rest of our clients didn't really know that we have actually capability and -- and that brand initiative that we launched last year was a key step. And then PA Consulting is now going to take it to a whole new level around the end-to-end solutions that we can provide. When you look at the IP that we have, it's pretty impressive across the board, and then the technology hubs that we focus on geospatial productive analytics, cyber, Internet-of-Things, intelligent asset management. And when you put it all together, the real differentiation for Jacobs is that we have both the domain knowledge, decades of experience working on all of these things, and markets and clients and we have typically -- state-of-the-art technology skillset in bringing digital solutions. So when you put that together, we feel like we're in that unique differentiated position. Yes, go ahead, Kev. Yes, it's about a little over 1.05, 1.06 to include Wood. It's one time. It is one time, even without Wood."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon, and thanks, everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and strategy update. It's been about a year since the pandemic started, and we hope everyone is safe and healthy, as COVID-19 continues to impact all facets of our daily lives. At Jacobs, in addition to keeping our people safe, we're continuing to support national governments and industry and their production and distribution of critical vaccines. Turning to Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results, it's important to review our strategy which is foundational to an investment in Jacobs. We believe the transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created a compelling multi-decade investment opportunity for our current and potential shareholders based on three key tenets. First, we have transformed our culture, aligned around a common purpose of creating a connected sustainable world underpinned by strong values of we do things right. We challenge the acceptance, we aim higher, and we live inclusion [ph]. This culture permeates through our more than 50,000 people, the solutions we deliver for our clients, and the engagement in our communities where we live and work. Our purpose-driven culture has also enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions, while also staying focused on our long-term vision of being a technology-enabled solutions provider. Second, we have a portfolio of solutions aligned to a diverse set of global opportunities such as space exploration, cyber readiness, climate change, and modernizing and digitizing our infrastructure. Our thematic growth areas are global, allowing us to address them efficiently, effectively, and competitively at scale through our integrated global platform of technology, our talented resources, domain expertise, and enhanced brand awareness. Finally, our Jacobs Management team has demonstrated the ability to strategically allocate capital, including successfully executing acquisitions. Our continued focus on strategy and execution has resulted in a strong start to fiscal 2021 even while continuing to manage the headwinds from the global pandemic. First quarter net revenue increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 8%. Our backlog ended the first quarter up 11% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong momentum, we're increasing the mid-point of our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and EPS outlook. Our cash flow generation was strong during the first quarter, and our balance sheet remains healthy. In the near-term, we do expect to deploy excess cash towards paying down debt. Last quarter, we announced a strategic majority investment in PA Consulting, and we are happy to share that the transaction was overwhelmingly approved on February 4 with 99.8% of PA shareholders voted in favor of the transaction. Particularly exciting was the fact that the voluntary election for management rollover was fully subscribed and new partner hiring has also been very successful post announcement, indicating the enthusiasm and commitment of PA partners and employees about the future growth opportunity of this partnership. Confirmation of the scheme of arrangement is awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, and we expect to close the investment by the end of this current quarter. PA's performance for calendar 2020 exceeded our expectations, and their pipeline of strategic and technical consulting work continues to grow. This includes a new engagement with the UK's Department of International Trade, advising on project defense and UK supply chain resilience to underpin economic and national security. Along with reaching a key milestone with the National Institute for Health Research, where they completed a UK public sector first delivery of Google Cloud Search to upgrade research platforms. Once we complete the transaction, we expect significant benefit for the clients of our firms driven by the complementary solutions offering of PA and Jacobs. Now looking further into fiscal 2021 and beyond, we believe Jacobs has a compelling organic growth opportunity and as appropriate, we will further accelerate that growth through thoughtful strategic acquisitions that offer a higher return versus our alternatives of repurchasing shares of Jacobs. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to review some recent ESG actions. As a company we're committed to delivering results to all our stakeholders, our employees, our clients, our investors, and our communities. Delivering on this includes our commitment to our sustainability strategy called PlanBeyond and our Climate Action Plan launched last year. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a net zero carbon, including 100% renewable energy for our operations in 2020. And our carbon reduction targets have been formally approved by the science-based targets initiative. The climate agenda will continue to be front and center in 2021 with the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 being held in November. In support, Jacobs announced our Pledge to Action, a campaign inviting our clients and suppliers around the globe to take measurable actions to tackle climate change before the opening of COP26, and we're also leveraging the power of our Jacobs people in making a positive impact. We launched our Climate Countdown Challenge where employees can join a new mission each month to tackle the climate crisis. Through both of these initiatives, we hope to raise awareness, inspire, and motivate individuals and companies and demonstrate the collective power of organizations taking actions now to make an impact for generations to come. Moving to Slide 6, at Jacobs, we intend to lead from the front in the transformation to a net zero economy. In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, Climate change remains the major global driver for ecological, social, and economic disruption, impacting every person, community, business, and governments around the world. It's also a major disruptor advancing technology-enabled innovation and sustainable business models for addressing decarbonization, the global energy transition and resource scarcity. Jacobs is uniquely positioned to support our clients and communities in developing and deploying solutions and technologies across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including renewable energy and clean power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and energy storage, green buildings, sustainable transport, circular economy, carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as adaptation and resilience for all facets of infrastructure. This includes developing technology solutions, like our recently announced launch of Jacobs Travel Service Optimization solution, which transforms the home-to-school travel experience for special educational needs and disabilities children and young people. This solution combines our deep domain knowledge with the latest advances in data analytics to determine the most efficient ride sharing experience, while supporting decarbonization and our long-term transition to a net zero economy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Thanks, Kevin. Now, let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong start to the fiscal year, we're raising the low-end of our previous guidance ranges. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be in a range of $1.075 billion to $1.155 billion versus our previous outlooks of $1.055 billion to $1.155 billion. And we expect adjusted EPS to now be in a range of $5.30 to $6 versus our previous outlook of $5.20 to $6. It is important to note that our guidance does not include any benefit from the PA Consulting investment, which we expect to close by the end of fiscal second quarter. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, as we benefit from our Focus 2023 initiatives, as well as potential infrastructure related stimulus and a strong alignment to a diverse set of large secular growth opportunities. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes, go ahead, Kevin. Great. So we are a company that is always active and making sure we're exploring all opportunities globally, and we're going to continue to do that. We have recently executed on some acquisitions with The Buffalo Group and PA Consulting most recently, and Wood Nuclear is fairly new. So, for us our top priority is to execute on those recent acquisitions and demonstrate continued success. We feel proud of what we achieved with a major one of CH2M back in 2017 and have successfully executed and exceeded expectations, and so we want to focus on that right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the next months, our primary capital deployment is going to be to pay down debt. However, when we look at the pipeline of opportunities in our strategy, there are several bolt-on opportunities even within PA Consulting. When we think about what we have initiated there coming together with PA, they've been a very successful firm in doing bolt-on acquisitions. It's helped them create value, and we want to continue to support that, and together we think that there's going to be some real interesting things that we can do in that whole consulting arena, which is higher margin and higher value business. And then of course, anything that we can do to just accelerate our digital modernization, strategic data utilization as we have done with the series of cyber acquisitions, including most recently KeyW and The Buffalo Group, and so we'll continue to be active on the government services space, and any other bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our P&PS business as well. And, the final thing I'll say is there's some geographic expansion opportunities when you looked at our mix of business, yes, it really is still majority -- the majority of our revenue comes from the U.S. and UK and then it drops down significantly from there. And so, we think there's some great geographic expansion initiatives over the coming years. Chad, maybe I'll start. When we talk about the P&Ps business, clearly what's driving our pipeline are the things that Bob talked about initially, and that is the whole digital modernization and strategic data utilization across all of our clients and buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities. The whole climate change arena is clearly going to be ramping up with the change in administration in the U.S., but just a global priorities that's going on there. And look when we talk about climate change, the things we're already doing in SolarWinds and now hydrogen is kicking in and the energy storage with batteries and the whole resiliency strength that we have which we've been doing for the last several years around, flooding and sea-level rise and a whole host of other things pretty fast, et cetera. And then the whole opportunity around the advanced facilities business with regard to what the pandemic is accelerated and in the life sciences business and the electronics business because on the life sciences side, there is now a pent-up demand on non-COVID activities, obviously the priority is probably vaccines and therapeutics, but oncology, diabetes, emerging cell in gene therapy and also the fact that there is more need for capacity, so there is a huge contract whole manufacturing opportunity that's now presenting itself. And then the whole healthcare side with hospitals and what's going on globally there. And then the electronics with the future of work with everything from 5G to data centers to the semiconductor, there is clearly a wave of growth in that business as well. So -- and then on top of all that is what countries are doing around the world starting with the U.S. around stimulating their economies, coming out of the pandemic. Clearly we're seeing positive momentum in the U.S. Though we expect to see something soon with this first COVID relief package, but we're anxious to see what comes out over the coming months in the whole infrastructure stimulus, which will benefit Jacobs, it's upside. This is 2022 and beyond when we talk about infrastructure stimulus out here is not dependent on it. And then from a standpoint of UK, very positive momentum in many of the other countries are also kicking in with their infrastructure initiatives, economic initiatives. So real positive momentum on the P&PS. So, Bob do you want to comment on the backlog on CMS? Space is -- has been a legacy, strengthen and an important part of our revenue going back to the -- the long history we have with NASA, where we're NASA's leading solutions provider across essentially all of their sites and so that's our foundation. And then with the KeyW acquisition and some of the other initiatives that we've done both organically and bolted-on is that first of all, low-earth space intelligence that Bob just talked about that we're very excited about most of that is a very highly classified work. So that's now going to -- we believe is going to be a very high growth add-on to our whole space initiatives. So -- and then would be adjacency work that comes with our intelligence work and relationship with the space community is the whole hypersonics area that it's going to be something that is big for us starting in the sort of the consulting research development and then getting into some of the big programs there. So well over a $1 billion today and one that we expect high growth walk going forward. Yes, and it's over 1, even without Wood. I'm sorry. All right, thank you. In conclusion, our Jacob's people drive our performance. And this year more than ever, their commitment, creativity, and perseverance was our differentiator. We've chosen to honor their spirit in our integrated Annual Report for 2020, which we launched two weeks ago. I encourage you to visit the Investor page of our website to read the report and explore some of the stories of accomplishment for our clients and our communities in furthering our strong culture. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-K were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Now turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then provide an overview of our software and technology platforms. Bob will then review our performance by line of business and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flows. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we'll open up the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we provide additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 business performance and 2023 outlook. As I transition to Jacobs' Executive Chair, I'm excited and confident about the next phase of our strategy boldly moving forward. This strategy continues to unlock and elevate our transformed high-performance culture to capture significant growth opportunities we've identified across climate response, consulting advisory and data solutions, while benefiting from the recurring nature and diversity of our core businesses. From a financial standpoint, we believe the rigorous execution of this strategy will result in enhanced long-term revenue growth and expansion in our profit margin profile. During our last 2 strategies, we maintained a focus on continuing to reshape our business through organic investments, acquisitions and divestitures. And by doing so, we were able to deliver value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Since we started our journey together in 2016, we intentionally transformed our culture and our brand, grew revenue and expanded profit margins, leading to a total shareholder return of approximately 250%, almost twice the return of the S&P 500. We believe the next phase will be equally as transformative as we maintain our brand promise of challenging today and reinventing tomorrow. Let's now discuss our fourth quarter results. We're seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in our sales pipelines in a number of marquee recent wins which underscores our strategy. During the quarter, net revenue grew 6% year-over-year and grew 11% on a constant currency basis with another quarter of constant currency growth across each line of business. Backlog was up 5% from the prior year's quarter and 8% on a constant currency basis. Within People & Places Solutions, our advanced facilities business again posted double-digit year-over-year top line and operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. And the remaining P&PS units in constant currency also experienced year-over-year growth. During the current quarter, Critical Mission Solutions is beginning to see previously delayed opportunities into the final stages with a major cyber win last week and with another win close to clearing the protest period. PA Consultancy and -- PA Consulting in constant currency continued to show strong Q4 growth with revenue up 9% and backlog up 8% year-over-year. PA successfully won a large multiyear contract with the Ministry of Defense to secure the next-generation soldier in what's proving to be a digitally enabled battlefield. From a full year standpoint, we finished the year within our original guidance range, even when recognizing the translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar with double-digit net revenue and operating profit growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss an element of our data solutions accelerator that's housed within the Divergent Solutions business unit which we will formally break out starting in our fiscal first quarter of 2023. We have consolidated the majority of our software and data solutions into a single unit to gain benefits from consistent product management, marketing and research and development. Our data solutions are aligned to 3 high-growth verticals of transportation, water and national security. A competitive differentiation of our vertical software platforms is access and integration of unique data sets and the ability to turn that data into actionable outcomes for our customers. For example, our StreetLight Data platform is a SaaS solution that ingests a variety of mobility data sources into proprietary algorithms that provide data analytics for both traditional transportation clients and giga projects within the broader infrastructure market. Our GeoPod technology creates mapping data for multiple confidential customers as they plan for autonomous driving, precision agriculture and other aerial surveillance requirements. In water, we continue to leverage smart algorithms developed by our domain experts to optimize our clients' operations and maintenance, both AquaDNA and our intelligent and our intelligent O&M solution can save 10% to 30% in energy use for wastewater treatment. We continue to expand our water solutions across our clients' assets life cycle. From a national security standpoint, our extreme search solution has proprietary algorithms and compute ability that can rapidly search large volumes of real-time or log data. One critical use case is quickly finding indicators of compromise to prevent cyber breaches. Given the significant amount of data that will be created and utilized in IT and OT environments, we believe the applications of these types of solutions are in the early stages of decades of robust growth. Before I turn the call over to Bob, first, I'd like to thank the amazing people at Jacobs for living our values and progressing our culture over the last several years. Every single day, Jacobs is providing critical solutions globally. For example, most recently, supporting NASA for the Artemis launch to the move or consulting on green hydrogen solutions for sovereign nations, delivering world-scale biotechnology manufacturing solutions, remediating harmful PaaS chemicals from our water or planning autonomous transportation for the city of the future. It is truly our people that make Jacobs a company like no other. Now, I'd like to congratulate Bob on his appointment to CEO and say that I'm excited to have experienced a dynamic leader who brings decades of industry domain knowledge and a proven track record to lead our boldly moving forward strategy into the future. Bob?\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. I'm honored to take on the role of CEO early next year and advance the exciting work underway to further diversify our capabilities and offerings, increasing opportunities and value for our people, our clients and our shareholders alike. I want to thank Steve for his partnership and guidance over the past 7 years. He is an incredible leader who inspires all around and will leave a tremendous legacy at Jacobs. I'll begin on Slide 6, discussing our People & Places Solutions business where we achieved strong top and bottom line results with backlog up 8% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency. With critical infrastructure priorities on the rise over the past year, our quarter results show that we've been successful in converting opportunity into accessible backlog. This success is underpinned by our global workforce which expanded 12% this year. For example, in FY '22, our advanced facilities operating -- advanced facilities unit operating profit grew by well over 25% and on a constant currency basis due to our scalable multi-geography delivery teams. Overall, we see our quarter results as Jacobs strategy in action. It's proof that Jacobs deep domain expertise can transform client outcomes, replacing conventional infrastructure delivery with modern data-enabled solutions. I'll discuss results under the themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization and climate response. Across these themes, I'll highlight how our technology and data solutions enable our success. First, supply chain diversification has led to expanded delivery for clients with long-term investment profiles that continue through changing economic conditions. In life sciences, our clients are in the middle of a generational expansion of therapeutics and vaccines as well as advanced health care and [indiscernible] on a global scale. Our confidential clients can accelerate production capacity for life-saving medicines for the most widespread chronic diseases by leveraging Jacobs' expertise in digital design to optimize delivery across multiple large-scale biotech campuses. We are also advising and delivering predictive analytics for point-of-care treatment resulting in improved outcomes for a growing and aging population with clients such as New South Wales Health Infrastructure in Australia, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. Jacobs remains uniquely positioned across the entire electric vehicle ecosystem to address all aspects of this rapidly expanding market from manufacturing capacity to EV charging infrastructure to advanced mobility implementation. With favorable tailwinds and expanding list of automobile and EV manufacturing clients are seeking Jacobs' leading support to develop sustainable production capacity. Moving to climate response. Global demand for affordable green energy led to an increase of over 33% in bookings with wins across multiple geographies, including the U.K.'s National Grid, U.S. Department of Energy, [indiscernible] of Energy in Korea where we're developing a new green hydrogen production and import facility. In the U.S., IIJA supported pipeline is building momentum and projects are moving through the sales cycle into delivery. For example, there is a broad focus on transportation decarbonization with support for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, NEVI, across multiple DOTs. Charging infrastructure for the navy and in multiple states under the low or no emission vehicle brand programs. For the environment agency in the U.K., we are living a digital proof of concept, leveraging spatial, predictive analytics to avoid extensive damage in human casualties due to flooding and other climate-driven disasters. At the same time, national highways chose us to streamline their complex data landscape, thanks to our cyber and digital capabilities, partnered with PA Consulting. With StreetLight Data's multimodal transportation insights platform, we've expanded opportunities for both traditional public sector transportation clients and new private sector clients to prioritize marketing and real estate investments. Water sector clients are investing in our new technologies, such as AquaDNA, Dragonfly and intelligent operations maintenance. These integrated AI and ML cloud-based technologies enable clients to provide reliable clean water access for all communities, leading to expanded services this quarter from wins in Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, the U.K., Singapore and Australia. These innovative platforms are driving the new standard for asset management. In Hawaii, we are delivering a 20-year installation development plan to address climate adaptation for the joint base Pearl Harbor hiccup. Under infrastructure modernization, mega program delivery trends continue as clients look for more efficient ways to deliver sustainable, liveable places. In Scandinavia, we are designing the Nord Aven tunnel to across the harbor in Copenhagen, Denmark. And in Toronto, MetroLinx recently awarded Jacobs a multiyear extension to support their $85 billion regional transit expansion. In summary, People & Places Solutions is positioned for long-term growth as evidenced by strong performance across all geographies and client segments. Clients are continuing to partner with Jacobs to deliver transformative infrastructure, advanced manufacturing expansion and energy security projects with sustainable lasting outcomes. Moving to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions line of business. CMS delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter with backlog remaining strong at $10.6 billion, flat year-over-year, with gross profit in backlog was up 10% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating diligent revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. CMS's service and solutions offerings are delivered across our core customer markets: space, cyber, intelligence, defense and energy. And we continue to see strong demand for our solutions across all of them. In space, Jacobs is a critical prime contractor to NASA's Artemis program, including being the key integrator of the successful uncrewed launch last week of the space launch system rocket in preparation to spend U.S. astronauts back to the moon by 2025. The Artemis 1 launch is historic and we are proud of Jacob's role in the mission. Also, we were awarded contracts by the Scottish rocket manufacturer and small sat launch service provider, Urbex, to help them build and operate a vertical launch site for satellites in the U.K. Several trends in other Jacobs key markets that we are seeing contributing to our continued growth include Zero Trust Architecture [ph], hypersonics and modular reactors. Beginning with Zero Trust Architecture or ZTA. White House Executive Order, 1028, mandates, adoption of ZTA cybersecurity models across the federal government. Importantly, ZTA requires continuous verification of identity as movers as users move laterally through network systems. Jacobs' cyber intelligence team which is now part of our new Divergent Solution operating unit is the program manager for one of the intelligence communities largest [indiscernible], responsible for identity, credential and access management, ICAM. ICAM is a critical architectural component of effective Zero Trust models and Jacobs' technical leadership in this area positions us to help clients across the federal government, meet the White House executive order. Our cyber and intelligence business unit has a significant pipeline of opportunities requiring ZTA adoption. In Q4, our cyber intelligence team also won several new non-ZTA contracts, including an agile software development and sustainment contract or a classified contract and one assisting the Navy to advance their radar sensing capability at the Naval Research Laboratory. We also recently cleared the protest period for a $470 million 6-year IDIQ, providing identity intelligence support to the DoD which is not yet reflected in backlog. Moving on to hypersonics. With advances in hypersonic missile technology by China and Russia, the U.S. Department of Defense is developing missile defenses to defend against hypersonic weapons and other emergent threats. Because hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of at least MAC 5, roughly 1 mile per second and can maneuver in route to their target, they are more difficult to defend against. Jacobs has decades of experience supporting the U.S. Air Force and NASA and has positioned itself as a leader in hypersonic solutions. In last quarter, Jacobs was awarded a 5-year $100 million IDIQ to help the U.S. Navy design and operate an underwater launch test system with the Naval Surface Warfare [ph]. The contract also covers modernization, design, fabrication and operation support for an in-air launch testing platform at the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake in California. Finally, demand for modular reactors. Nuclear power is coming into favor as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuels. For countries to achieve their next zero carbon emission goals and ensure energy independence and security, leaders are realizing they need to include the always-on emission-free generation. Small modular reactors or SMRs are reactors with electric generating capacity of 300 megawatts versus traditional large reactors with generating capacity of 1 gigawatt or more. SMRs have numerous benefits, including lower initial capital investment, greater scalability through factory manufacturing processes, greater siding flexibility on smaller grid and isolated areas and greater energy efficiency. In the U.K., we are delivering engineering and technical services to the Rolls-Royce SMR program and licensing advice to GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy as they look to enter the U.K. market. There's also increased interest in new advanced modular reactors or AMRs, that can be designed to provide specific benefits such as producing high heat for green hydrogen. We are supporting multiple AMR vendors in the U.S. and U.K. Jacobs is a leader in global nuclear solutions, building on our long legacy of organic capabilities and acquisitions of CH2M and Wood Nuclear. In summary, we continue to see solid revenue visibility for our solutions in FY '23 and with approximately 85% of CMS's portfolio, consisting of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than 4 years and 88% from federal level government funding. We are also pleased with the Government Accountability Office's recent guidance to have the U.S. Air Force re-evaluate proposals for its large Integrated Support Contract, ISC 2.0, in support of a new source selection decision. And therefore, this remains in our pipeline as a potential multibillion-dollar opportunity. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business at approximately $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Moving on to PA Consulting on Slide 8. PA continues to deliver its strategy and is securing exciting and enduring work. PA's deep insight lasting relationships and ability to assist clients through economic cycles is also generating consistent demand for its expertise. This quarter, PA was awarded marquee wins across the key markets. As Steve mentioned, in the U.K. public sector, where it's a major player, PA was selected as the lead systems integrator for a multiyear contract providing next-generation solutions to counter threats posed by radio-controlled improvised explosive devices, IED. The contract leverages PA's extensive experience in major program delivery as they lead the delivery consortium, Team Protect. PA was also appointed to oversee the delivery of a once-in-a-generation program for social care reform in the U.K., further cementing its position in government and public sector. Transport continues to be a major focus with additional awards won at Schipol Airport in the Netherlands, where the joint capabilities of Jacobs and PA continue to create further opportunities to include boardroom advisory and digitalization of airside operations. The Jacobs PA partnership is strongly positioned to continue to capitalize on substantial market opportunities. Jacobs' global footprint and broad-based domain expertise together with PA's high-end digital consulting, creates a compelling value proposition in distinct areas of opportunity. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year and net revenue was 6% and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. All lines of businesses grew fourth quarter revenue over 9% versus a year ago in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% and improved slightly from the third quarter but was approximately down 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by: one, our CMS line of business due to the newly ramped remediation contract; and two, investments in incremental employees in TA in advance of the large wins such as the U.K. MOD award that will ramp over the coming months. We expect gross margins to modestly improve from Q4 levels during fiscal 2023, driven by recent wins in cyber, favorable revenue mix, recent wins in PA Consulting and continued strong performance in our People & Places Solutions business. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.2%, down 40 basis points from Q3 and down 200 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from lower labor expenses as we managed our cost structure. We are targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $309 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $14 million with over half associated with integration costs of acquisitions. And finally, a positive benefit from third-party recoveries of $27 million pretax which we excluded from our adjusted results. Adjusted operating profit was therefore $347 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, it was up 19% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.75 per share and included a $0.16 benefit from the third-party recovery receivable, a $0.12 benefit to align to our effective adjusted tax rate, offset by a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.06 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.80, up 14% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. Jacobs' consolidated Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $350 million and was up 13% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year. Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, backlog was impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar at year-end compared to the end of the third quarter. As an example, the dollar strengthened 8% versus the pound sterling from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4. As a result, on a constant currency basis, backlog was flat sequentially. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.94x with our gross margin book-to-bill at 1.05x given a higher margin profile within backlog on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching Kennedy NASA rebid as backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Now moving to Slide 10 for a brief recap of our full year 2022 performance. Fiscal [ph] year gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 10% in constant currency. On a reported basis, we expect fiscal 2023 revenue growth in the mid-single digits and high single digits on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating profit was $918 million, up significantly year-over-year, driven by a material decrease in onetime items related to transaction and restructuring as well as solid underlying constant currency growth in the business. GAAP EPS was $4.98 and adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% year-over-year and up 13% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit grew 10.6% and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins expanded nearly 30 basis points to 10.4%, driven by revenue mix benefits and lower support costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 10% and up 12% in constant currency. As a percentage of net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%, up 20 basis points from fiscal 2021. We expect modest adjusted operating profit margin expansion in fiscal 2023, driven by a combination of a higher margin revenue mix and lower employee-related costs. However, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be flat year-over-year as other income will be burdened primarily by unfavorable pension costs driven by the higher interest rate environment. On a trailing 12-month basis, book-to-bill was 0.97x and gross margin book-to-bill was over 1 at 1.05. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q4 performance and Slide 12 for full year performance. Starting with CMS; Q4 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 12% in constant currency, [indiscernible] contributed approximately $22 million to the fourth quarter revenue. Fiscal 2020 revenue on a reported and constant currency basis grew 3% as the part of the year -- as the first part of the year did not benefit from the ramp of the Idaho nuclear remediation win. Black Links contributed $50 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the CMS business and higher double-digit growth in our Divergent Solutions unit. Q4 CMS operating profit was $95 million, down 17% year-over-year and down 14% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins as a result, were down 220 basis points year-over-year to 6.9%. Consistent with our previous outlook, Q4 operating margin percentage were impacted by a rate true-up in our cyber and intelligence business. The rate true-up was related to higher G&A over the course of the year given the slower ramp in the business during the continuing resolution. Looking forward, we have successfully been awarded a large new classified cyber win that was previously delayed during the continuing resolution, indicating developing momentum. Looking into fiscal 2023, we expect approximately 75 basis points of sequential operating margin expansion in Q1 and driven by immediate rebound from the onetime rate true-up in Q4. We're also targeting further margin expansion through fiscal 2023 as we win and ramp new higher-margin awards. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Overall, P&PS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 net revenue was up 6% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. On a constant currency basis, each P&PS region demonstrated net revenue growth. And for the full year, P&PS grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Looking deeper into our business units, our advanced facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and EV supply chains, posted another stellar quarter of double-digit revenue operating profit growth. For the fiscal year, the business grew operating profit well north of 25%. We expect our advanced facilities growth rate to continue to remain robust during the fiscal year 2023 at approximately 10% despite the strong year-over-year comparisons. The P&PS International business, Q4 revenue and operating profit was essentially flat year-over-year on a reported basis but grew double digits in constant currency. For the full year, international operating profit was up 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during fiscal 2023, resulting in flattish reported revenue growth but is poised for full year growth on a constant currency basis. Total P&PS Q4 gross profit and margins were up year-over-year with Q4 operating profit up 31% and operating profit as a percentage of net revenue up 275 basis points, driven by revenue growth and mix as well as lower labor costs during the quarter. Full year People & Places operating profit was up 5.5% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency, with operating margins of 13.2%, up 20 basis points versus a year ago. In terms of PA's performance, PA Q4 revenue declined 7.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but it grew 9% in pound sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 19.4% during the quarter due to continued lower utilization and investments in pipeline pursuits. As Bob mentioned, PA Consulting has been successful winning the large [indiscernible] award with the MOD for which we expect to show benefit later in 2023. We continue to target double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis with operating margins returning to above 20% throughout 2023, driven by improved utilization. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $28 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from lower incentive costs and to a lesser extent, from a positive currency impact on our supported costs and other benefits. We now expect non-allocated costs -- corporate costs to be $190 million to $210 million for fiscal 2023 which is slightly higher than fiscal year 2022 as we expect higher incentive costs on a year-over-year basis. Now turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $230 million in Q4 and included $12 million related to transaction costs and other items. On a full year basis, reported cash flow was $347 million but included the net $475 million of cash outflows related to the previously announced Inpex settlement, the first $55 million repayment of Cares Act payroll tax deferral and a net $4 million cash benefit related to other items. Excluding these items, free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 97% for the year. For fiscal 2023, we expect 2 items to impact cash flow an approximately net $15 million of further cash outflows from restructuring, transaction and other related costs. And a final repayment of $60 million of Cares Act payroll tax deferral benefits. Excluding these items, we anticipate again to achieve 100% free cash flow to adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2023. We are also continuing to evaluate further real estate opportunities given our developing insight as to our longer-term needs given the hybrid work environment and we will update on our Q1 earnings call with further developments in this regard. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $31 million of shares. And for the full year, we repurchased $282 million. After September, we have continued to be actively purchasing shares with approximately $135 million repurchased as of last week. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic and repurchasing shares as we see disruption in the market. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.4 billion, resulting in a $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.6x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q4, approximately 60% of our debt is like the floating rate debt. And as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward which we have incorporated into our outlook. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.6%. Early in the fourth quarter, we entered into a notional $500 million interest rate lock at a rate of 2.7% as related to a planned future fixed rate issuance. The mark-to-market benefit from the in the money interest rate lock is currently recognized in other comprehensive income but will offset interest expense of our future expected fixed income issuance. Also, in early October, we redeemed $481 million of private notes at par. In the appendix on Slide 16 of the presentation, we included additional detail related to our debt maturities and interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which we announced at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and paid on October 28. I will now turn the call back over to Bob.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 14. As we discussed throughout our remarks, through proactive portfolio management, we have aligned our business to sectors that continue to demonstrate robust growth through multiple economic scenarios. We continue to enhance our overall growth rate with our climate response consulting and advisory and data solutions strategic accelerators. Given the volatility of FX rates, we are providing our outlook under 2 FX scenarios: one, an outlook based on constant currency which provides greater insight of underlying business performance; and two, an outlook based on more recent FX rates. Although we transact in multiple currencies, one example for reference is the pound sterling. The full year 2022 average conversion rate for the pound sterling was $1.28 compared to $1.15 early November 2022. As footnote in our earnings release and investor presentation, based on fiscal 2022 average rate, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.465 billion to $1.545 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.90, up 10% and 12%, respectively, at the midpoint. Based on rates in early November, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.20 to $7.50, both up 6% at the midpoint. On a net revenue basis, the difference between these 2 scenarios is approximately $430 million. Looking beyond fiscal 2023, we remain confident achieving double-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, consistent with our strategic plan. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel.\nBert Subin: Congratulations to both Bob and Steve.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks, Bert.\nBert Subin: Bob, maybe to start out with you. You ended there talking about feeling pretty confident in sort of double-digit growth. You guys have previously provided your fiscal '24 targets by segment on both a margin and a sales basis. If we exclude the impact of FX, do you still remain confident in those bands across each segment?\nBob Pragada: We do, Bert. The tailwinds that we see in the markets that we're certain, we stand by those commitments that we made on the -- in the '24 strategic line.\nBert Subin: Okay. And just a quick follow-up in terms of thinking about P&PS. It performed really well during the quarter and you made some pretty positive comments on what you're seeing on the advanced facility side. Should we expect any sort of incremental softness just as your semiconductor clients slow their spend? And in terms of the infrastructure side of things in the segment, are you starting to see a material uptick from IIJA? Or is that just the plan as you sort of -- as you progress through '23?\nBob Pragada: Sure. So let me answer the first question. On the semiconductor spend, the industry as a whole from a demand standpoint is in a bit of soft period. The client base and the geographies that we're working in, we have not seen that. And so the front end, the design work, the momentum that we've seen over the course of the last 6 to 8 quarters, that has not slowed at all. And so we're feeling comfortable about where we sit in that ecosystem of consultants to that, specifically with our client base. So we're positive on that front. On IIJA, we actually -- we are seeing those projects that we have been tracking through the development of both grants as well as the formula funding coming to fruition. Probably the bigger element to that is that the release of those monies is actually unlocking the base funding that the states previously, specifically during COVID, had locked up not knowing kind of what the future looks like. So overall, the pipeline is up on the U.S. basis and infrastructure. Our pipeline is up of 4% to 5% -- I'm sorry, 5% without IIJA, 18% with IIJA from a pipeline standpoint; so we are seeing that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair.\nLouie Dipalma: I would like to echo congrats to Steve and Bob on your new roles.\nBob Pragada: Thank you.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks, Louie\nLouie Dipalma: For Steve and Bob, you referenced several cyber intel awards associated with your KeyW and Buffalo Group acquisitions. Are these awards margin accretive? And should the Critical Missions operating profit in 2023 be back to the 2021 level?\nBob Pragada: So both question, Louie, the answer is yes. The award -- the 2 awards that Steve and I specifically spoke about are coming in through those 2 at a portals or through those relationships that we had and the acquisitions that we made during that period. So we are seeing that. They are margin accretive. This -- the flip side of this is that these are awards that we had expected in previous quarters. And we talked about it a lot in previous earnings calls, that the knock-on effect of the CR has now had an effect on kind of when those things start. So we do see margins going up and these are serving as catalysts for that too.\nKevin Berryman: The other thing, Louis, though, '21 was the high point. So I would say that the underlying business is returning. We had some other events in 2021 that accelerated the margin a little bit higher. We had some one-off closeouts which were pretty strong. But I think in 2023, the underlying is getting back up well into the 8s, I would say. So maybe not all the way back up to the -- I think we were at 9% in 2021 but we're going to get underlying to be quite consistent with 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe for Bob or Kevin, you call out in your CMS the improved in -- the book-to-bill but also the gross margin book-to-bill. Maybe you can talk a little bit about P&PS and PAC in a similar light? Or do you want to give out the actual numbers? And how much is -- as you look into timing of awards and ramp up and some of the utilization issues that you or fit in '22, is that more of mid- to later '23 to show some much better for FX better growth as we move towards the end of '23?\nKevin Berryman: I'm sorry, Mike, you were breaking up. I was having trouble understanding you. I apologize.\nMichael Dudas: So first, Kevin, I'm just talking about like your book to bill, you talked about the CMS gross margin book-to-bill. Maybe you could highlight in PP&S [ph] and PAC similar just the observations relative to what's in backlog, what do you anticipate in new orders? And maybe the timing of those orders relative to your outlook for 2023?\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Okay, got that. All right. Thanks, Mike. So look, People & Places continue to show good margin profile and backlog as well. So I think that's obviously, a very critical part of our strategy. When we think about delivering more value-added solutions, the margin is it's got to come with it. So the backlog margin profile is better in People & Places and also it's better in PA as well. And the dynamic of PA relative to the Q4 number really was effectively the continued utilization we -- to get up to around 20%. We fell a little bit short of that but it's continuing to improve and we would expect that we'll get back up to those more normalized levels that we saw over the course of '22 -- early '22 relative to the margin profile there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Congrats, Bob. And congrats, Steve. I guess first question, over the long term, can you just talk to -- on CMS, can you talk to the strategic importance of CMS to the portfolio? And if margins continue to sort of underperform, would you consider sort of other options? Or do you see a path over time to get to, I think, the margin improvement targets that you laid out in the 2024 targets like how long before we get there? And then my second question, Kevin, the cash flow generation that you're implying for 2023, it's quite strong and your balance sheet is in good shape. So just trying to understand how you're looking at -- how you're thinking about the M&A profile versus share repurchase?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes. It's Steve here, Jamie. So I can speak for both the Board and management around that question is we, first of all, the whole strategy around Divergent Solutions was to break out the elements of CMS that are highly consistent, especially with the data solutions side of our 3 accelerators; and so obviously [indiscernible]. We're excited about that. That's where we're really going to see accelerated margin growth, especially with these recent cyber wins that we've talked about but also across the entire platform. And then when you get into the remaining CMS business, just as an example, nuclear most recently has been surging with regard to becoming a clean energy transition solution. And as you know, we're a major player in nuclear, not just in the remediation side but the new build side, especially in the new technology of advanced small modular reactors. So, we're excited about the future of those and we'll continue to monitor the entire company as far as fit, et cetera, long term, as we've done in the past. And I mentioned in my remarks but we're very optimistic about the CMS business as we move into 2023.\nKevin Berryman: Jamie, about the cash flow. Yes, we feel continued strength in our cash flow is expected over the course of 2023, that provides us degrees of freedom, to your point, about how we will deploy that additional capital that's available. So look, I think we continue to monitor the M&A front, I think we were very clear during our strategy as to where we would probably be focusing those ideas and thoughts relative to the 3 accelerators that we outlined in strategy and we're continuing to monitor those opportunities. There are things out there that are being evaluated obviously. Got to result in bid equalling ask where we feel like we can add an ROIC and a return profile to our shareholders that are appropriate; and so we'll see how that plays out. Of course, we also talked about during the prepared remarks, the proactive stance that we've been taking on the share repurchases. And so we feel like we're well positioned to be able to act when appropriate relative to a potential strategic opportunity and/or do share buybacks when there's market dislocation.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Steve and Bob, congratulations.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Bob, I'm wondering if you could just talk about your strategic priorities over the next 3 to 5 years just from a high-level standpoint, anything that we should be keeping in mind?\nBob Pragada: Yes, Jerry, obviously something that we've been -- I've been thinking about a lot. Maybe a couple of precursor comments and then directly to the question. The precursor comment was and I tried to infer -- say it almost explicitly, the way Steve has run the executive team and the company has been really very inclusive. And so when you look at our strategy, not just the one that we released last March but even in '16 and '19, that's a strategy that was developed by all of us as a team. So it's not me coming in with a new strategy. I feel very, very bought in and tied to with the strategy that we have. So the first big area around our clients. The accelerators that we have are the national and global priorities that are driving the world. And so that's going to continue to drive our business as we come up with more technology-enabled and client-driven type solutions. The second is around investments in our people. Our people have delivered time and time again over decades. But if you look at the profile of our people, although our business is weighted towards the U.S., our -- we have about a 55-45 U.S. versus outside of the U.S. profile of our people, really driven around that global delivery that we've counted for so long. And so those investments and continued driving around inclusion and diversity and sourcing talent from all over the world is going to be really, really important. And the last piece I'd say is around resilience. Resilience in our business with regards to our systems and how we run the company but also simplicity of our business. We've diversified the business and we've tried to have direct access to our clients. But making that -- having simplicity in the forefront is really key as well. So kind of segregated in those 3 main areas.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher: So we have about a month left on the current continuing resolution. So I'm curious what you've baked into the guidance for continuing resolution across your segments? And then I guess there's clearly a lot of cross currents in the global economy at the moment. What do you see as any other big risk to your guidance? And maybe what contingency plans do you have in process to address those risks?\nKevin Berryman: Maybe I'll make some comments first and then have my partners here add any additional commentary to think appropriate. So look, I think we feel pretty good about the continuing resolution, given the makeup of the Senate and the House and how that's going to be coming together. And we just had a really deep dive review from a government relations team feeling pretty good about how things are going to play out over the course of this quarter. So we don't believe that there is going to be a continuing resolution that extends well into 2023. We're hoping that that will become resolved near the end of the calendar year. So I think that we're already starting to see, regardless of that continuing resolution, some momentum building relative to what Bob alluded to as -- and I made some comments on in terms of the cyber and intelligence business starting to get unlocked relative to bids being awarded and whatnot. So, we think that the combination of those 2 things are embedded into our guidance. And I feel -- we feel pretty good about it actually.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Steve and Bob, congratulations.\nBob Pragada: Thanks, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So you mentioned you're still targeting double-digit constant currency revenue growth for PA Consulting but I think constant currency Q4 was in the high single digits. Does the recent large contract when you mentioned to give you the visibility you need to be confident around constant currency double-digit growth for FY '23 despite U.K. economic concerns? And does margin normalize higher quite significantly impair as revenue ramps up towards that 20% goal that you've given us before? Or should we think about a gradual margin ramp-up from here in PA?\nKevin Berryman: So if you look at the ramp-up of the year, certainly, that large win is part of the equation but it ends up kind of building over the course of 2023. And so it's less of a direct impact in 2023. What we do believe and our view on the U.K. is that we've -- I guess, I would characterize us as being underwhelmed by the level of activity -- productive activity in the government which has actually put some pressure in the short term relative to the U.K. But with the recent budget that was announced and some of the activity of our clients is starting to look much better. So we're feeling like longer-term into 2023, that we're going to start to see some incremental momentum versus kind of what we've been seeing over the last, I'm going to call it, 6 months. So, we're feeling that things will start to improve. The other thing is that the backlog and the pipeline of PA, we're seeing no challenges associated with that. Seeing a little bit of the burn profile, as mentioned just earlier relative to the, I'm going to call it, the unknown relative to the U.K. government but we're starting to see that instance in that issue going away as we speak.\nBob Pragada: Just to put some -- just to quantify Kevin's last comment, the pipeline growth in PA alone this quarter was 52% year-on-year. So the pipeline continues to grow. And the way we evaluate pipeline within the PA world, since it's a pure-play consultancy, are projects, programs, engagements where we already actually have started a bit of them, too. So these are promising as well as the programs that were announced in the budget that Kevin referenced. Other programs that PA and Jacobs are actually partnered on right now. So that's -- hence, the bit of positivity there along with some realism of the last couple of months on what's gone down.\nOperator: Your next question is from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: I just wanted to confirm whether we should still anticipate Divergent Solutions to be broken out as a new segment starting in the first quarter? And perhaps in advance of that, just trying to get a rough expectation as to what that business line is contributing to this initial fiscal '23 outlook maybe from an EBIT perspective?\nKevin Berryman: So the business is effectively operational right now and we will be executing against the promise that we made relative to reporting that as a separate segment on the financials. So Sean, we're on track to do that. So I think that we'll -- we're going to provide additional color commentary because we're still working through all of the accounting mechanisms to make sure that our systems are reporting accurately and the controls are in place because it's a pretty large change. But I will tell you that it will be one of the highest growth areas that we're expecting in the company for 2023. And effectively, it will be a margin profile that will be growing substantially over time, a little bit lower in 2023 than what we expect at the exit rate. But at the end of the day, we'll provide a lot of details in Q1 relative to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: So I was hoping you guys could expand on just like the opportunities for increased wallet share on infrastructure work? Maybe you can weave in some of the recent acquisitions and some of your expanded digital capabilities and just talk about just what sort of margin we should be kind of thinking about for these new projects?\nBob Pragada: Sorry, Chad, you were a little broken up there. Can you repeat the question?\nChad Dillard: Yes. So can you just expand on like what sort of incremental wallet share opportunities you have in your infrastructure business. And maybe weave into it as some of the recent acquisitions that you've had in terms of your expanded digital capabilities?\nBob Pragada: Okay. Infrastructure, was that -- that part?\nChad Dillard: Correct.\nBob Pragada: Yes, got it. Okay. In infrastructure, the opportunities continue to grow. I'd say broadly driven mostly in the U.S. but we're seeing this and Steve talked about the international -- I'm sorry, Kevin talked about the international business but heavily geared towards transportation and water with a growing profile around energy transition. And so those are kind of the 3 main areas. Environmental continues to be robust. So, we see those -- I mean, the pipeline growth I talked about before, has been really, really strong. On the acquisitions, that's a business where StreetLight Data probably was the last -- the one that we did, it was a smaller acquisition. And we are immediately seeing fit that we had anticipated in the deal kind of thesis around StreetLight all around that data-enabled [indiscernible] data in driving a different type of solution for our clients. They had clients before, predominantly the state DOTs in the U.S. but that's been expanded with our relationships. And then we're seeing private sector utilization too, as private sector firms have looked at the use of data in order to cite different investments that they're making from a capital project perspective; so very positive news on that front.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: I believe you're guiding 2023 growth mid-single digit or high single digit on a constant currency basis. You're citing some really robust sectors, EVs, life sciences, reshoring, hydrogen, autonomous. So what isn't growing that fast in the portfolio? Does it just take longer? Is there momentum the project [indiscernible]? Does organic growth profile actually reaccelerate further in 2024? And in 2024, you get just better operating leverage off that type of growth with higher utilization? How should we kind of think about that as we move forward into 2024?\nKevin Berryman: Well, look, if you think about the high single digits in terms of constant currency growth, I think that's pretty strong actually. And look, I think that the bottom line is -- for example, Bob just quoted the pipeline growth in the United States of near 20% kind of growth in the pipeline. It just takes a while for that to kind of [indiscernible] be won and then start to build the burn associated with it. So you're relying on your clients as much as you are anything else to be able to execute against that. And they're sometimes not as quick as we are ready to execute. So look, I think it's a growing momentum. And I think we're being prudent assuming how that's going to build over the course of 2023.\nBob Pragada: If I could add, Kevin, while we're adding on those end markets that do have a quicker burn profile, all 3 of us today talked about the growth in advanced facilities where that has been a catalyst for growth. So though the top line might be in those numbers that were quoted, I did think -- we did say on a constant currency basis, our bottom line growth would be double digits. So I think there's some real optimism in the portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Congrats, Steve and Bob.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks.\nGautam Khanna: I wanted -- just following up on some of the recent questions. Can you frame recompete exposure in fiscal '23 and maybe even opine on at that CMS and wherever you think it's noteworthy percentage of sales up for rebid? Or if there are any lumpy individual contracts that are up and maybe the timing of those?\nBob Pragada: Sure. I'd say that the recompete exposure in '23 is moderate to low. We -- it's predominantly in our CMS business and we've already gotten some real positive indications of some of those larger ones that are -- I say there's only a couple. So I would not characterize that as a big exposure in '23.\nKevin Berryman: The only one that -- we've called out the one at Kennedy which is -- that's a big one but we feel good about our position there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. And Bob, congratulations on promotion, Steve yours as well. Kevin, I just thought maybe a question for you. I wanted to understand the fourth quarter results here a little bit clear. I guess your corporate unallocated expense was $28 million. I think you were kind of suggesting it was going to be higher than that for the quarter as well as your guidance for '23 is implying a run rate of about $50 million per quarter. So I was wondering, I guess you called out incentive comp. You also mentioned an FX impact, keeping that number down this quarter. So could you comment on the size of the FX impact? And was that -- what the nature of that was? Is that like a noncash accounting thing for some hedges that you had in FX? Or was there something else in there that was driving that benefit to the quarter?\nKevin Berryman: No. Look, the dynamic -- I don't have the FX dynamic specifically outlined but certainly, we can follow up with you, Andy, on that. But if you think about it, our corporate-related costs that support costs are embedded around the world. And so effectively, if you have U.K., for example, corporate-related costs, they're getting translated into a lower rate effectively. So the value of those costs go down and that effectively had some benefits associated with us because it's all -- it's effectively corporate costs and not corporate revenue. So if you get the difference between the two. And then look, we have known that the constant currency dynamic was still robust but we knew that the reported currency continued to be a challenge and we are very proactive in terms of taking steps to ensure that we reach the commitment levels that we had established for the company. So we pay attention to this and very, very proactive in terms of the management of our cost structure during Q4.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets.\nSabahat Khan: Just, I guess, the earlier commentary around how much the pipeline is building up, including the IIJA. Kind of if we think about that bill and the other ones starting to flow through, maybe some offset with pricing maybe moderating, how do you expect, I guess, backlog just to trend over the course of the next 12 to 18 months? I guess is it fair to assume with that extra government funding it could continue to grow? I just want to understand what you have embedded in the guidance that you've provided today?\nKevin Berryman: Well, I will tell you that, as you may know, backlog is one of our incentive metrics. And I can assure you that our incentives are based on backlog continuing to show very strong growth year-over-year.\nBob Pragada: Maybe I could you like to add one more thing, just on what drives backlog which is sales at, we've put a tremendous amount we've been a sales-driven company for since inception. I think Dr. Jacob started that mantra. Our sales-driven growth and the investments we've made, [indiscernible] now our new Chief Growth Officer as well, has been very, very specific as our portfolio has developed over the period -- this most recent period of time. So we're putting the full force effort on our sales effort as the pipeline continues to grow; so timing is good.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Bob Pragada.\nBob Pragada: Yes. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. I'm looking forward to providing further updates on our progress and upcoming events and calls. Have a -- for those of you in the U.S., have a wonderful Thanksgiving.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year and net revenue was 6% and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. All lines of businesses grew fourth quarter revenue over 9% versus a year ago in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% and improved slightly from the third quarter but was approximately down 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by: one, our CMS line of business due to the newly ramped remediation contract; and two, investments in incremental employees in TA in advance of the large wins such as the U.K. MOD award that will ramp over the coming months. We expect gross margins to modestly improve from Q4 levels during fiscal 2023, driven by recent wins in cyber, favorable revenue mix, recent wins in PA Consulting and continued strong performance in our People & Places Solutions business. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.2%, down 40 basis points from Q3 and down 200 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from lower labor expenses as we managed our cost structure. We are targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $309 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $14 million with over half associated with integration costs of acquisitions. And finally, a positive benefit from third-party recoveries of $27 million pretax which we excluded from our adjusted results. Adjusted operating profit was therefore $347 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, it was up 19% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.75 per share and included a $0.16 benefit from the third-party recovery receivable, a $0.12 benefit to align to our effective adjusted tax rate, offset by a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.06 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.80, up 14% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. Jacobs' consolidated Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $350 million and was up 13% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year. Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, backlog was impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar at year-end compared to the end of the third quarter. As an example, the dollar strengthened 8% versus the pound sterling from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4. As a result, on a constant currency basis, backlog was flat sequentially. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.94x with our gross margin book-to-bill at 1.05x given a higher margin profile within backlog on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching Kennedy NASA rebid as backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Now moving to Slide 10 for a brief recap of our full year 2022 performance. Fiscal [ph] year gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 10% in constant currency. On a reported basis, we expect fiscal 2023 revenue growth in the mid-single digits and high single digits on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating profit was $918 million, up significantly year-over-year, driven by a material decrease in onetime items related to transaction and restructuring as well as solid underlying constant currency growth in the business. GAAP EPS was $4.98 and adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% year-over-year and up 13% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit grew 10.6% and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins expanded nearly 30 basis points to 10.4%, driven by revenue mix benefits and lower support costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 10% and up 12% in constant currency. As a percentage of net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%, up 20 basis points from fiscal 2021. We expect modest adjusted operating profit margin expansion in fiscal 2023, driven by a combination of a higher margin revenue mix and lower employee-related costs. However, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be flat year-over-year as other income will be burdened primarily by unfavorable pension costs driven by the higher interest rate environment. On a trailing 12-month basis, book-to-bill was 0.97x and gross margin book-to-bill was over 1 at 1.05. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q4 performance and Slide 12 for full year performance. Starting with CMS; Q4 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 12% in constant currency, [indiscernible] contributed approximately $22 million to the fourth quarter revenue. Fiscal 2020 revenue on a reported and constant currency basis grew 3% as the part of the year -- as the first part of the year did not benefit from the ramp of the Idaho nuclear remediation win. Black Links contributed $50 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the CMS business and higher double-digit growth in our Divergent Solutions unit. Q4 CMS operating profit was $95 million, down 17% year-over-year and down 14% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins as a result, were down 220 basis points year-over-year to 6.9%. Consistent with our previous outlook, Q4 operating margin percentage were impacted by a rate true-up in our cyber and intelligence business. The rate true-up was related to higher G&A over the course of the year given the slower ramp in the business during the continuing resolution. Looking forward, we have successfully been awarded a large new classified cyber win that was previously delayed during the continuing resolution, indicating developing momentum. Looking into fiscal 2023, we expect approximately 75 basis points of sequential operating margin expansion in Q1 and driven by immediate rebound from the onetime rate true-up in Q4. We're also targeting further margin expansion through fiscal 2023 as we win and ramp new higher-margin awards. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Overall, P&PS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 net revenue was up 6% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. On a constant currency basis, each P&PS region demonstrated net revenue growth. And for the full year, P&PS grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Looking deeper into our business units, our advanced facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and EV supply chains, posted another stellar quarter of double-digit revenue operating profit growth. For the fiscal year, the business grew operating profit well north of 25%. We expect our advanced facilities growth rate to continue to remain robust during the fiscal year 2023 at approximately 10% despite the strong year-over-year comparisons. The P&PS International business, Q4 revenue and operating profit was essentially flat year-over-year on a reported basis but grew double digits in constant currency. For the full year, international operating profit was up 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during fiscal 2023, resulting in flattish reported revenue growth but is poised for full year growth on a constant currency basis. Total P&PS Q4 gross profit and margins were up year-over-year with Q4 operating profit up 31% and operating profit as a percentage of net revenue up 275 basis points, driven by revenue growth and mix as well as lower labor costs during the quarter. Full year People & Places operating profit was up 5.5% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency, with operating margins of 13.2%, up 20 basis points versus a year ago. In terms of PA's performance, PA Q4 revenue declined 7.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but it grew 9% in pound sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 19.4% during the quarter due to continued lower utilization and investments in pipeline pursuits. As Bob mentioned, PA Consulting has been successful winning the large [indiscernible] award with the MOD for which we expect to show benefit later in 2023. We continue to target double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis with operating margins returning to above 20% throughout 2023, driven by improved utilization. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $28 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from lower incentive costs and to a lesser extent, from a positive currency impact on our supported costs and other benefits. We now expect non-allocated costs -- corporate costs to be $190 million to $210 million for fiscal 2023 which is slightly higher than fiscal year 2022 as we expect higher incentive costs on a year-over-year basis. Now turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $230 million in Q4 and included $12 million related to transaction costs and other items. On a full year basis, reported cash flow was $347 million but included the net $475 million of cash outflows related to the previously announced Inpex settlement, the first $55 million repayment of Cares Act payroll tax deferral and a net $4 million cash benefit related to other items. Excluding these items, free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 97% for the year. For fiscal 2023, we expect 2 items to impact cash flow an approximately net $15 million of further cash outflows from restructuring, transaction and other related costs. And a final repayment of $60 million of Cares Act payroll tax deferral benefits. Excluding these items, we anticipate again to achieve 100% free cash flow to adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2023. We are also continuing to evaluate further real estate opportunities given our developing insight as to our longer-term needs given the hybrid work environment and we will update on our Q1 earnings call with further developments in this regard. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $31 million of shares. And for the full year, we repurchased $282 million. After September, we have continued to be actively purchasing shares with approximately $135 million repurchased as of last week. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic and repurchasing shares as we see disruption in the market. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.4 billion, resulting in a $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.6x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q4, approximately 60% of our debt is like the floating rate debt. And as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward which we have incorporated into our outlook. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.6%. Early in the fourth quarter, we entered into a notional $500 million interest rate lock at a rate of 2.7% as related to a planned future fixed rate issuance. The mark-to-market benefit from the in the money interest rate lock is currently recognized in other comprehensive income but will offset interest expense of our future expected fixed income issuance. Also, in early October, we redeemed $481 million of private notes at par. In the appendix on Slide 16 of the presentation, we included additional detail related to our debt maturities and interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which we announced at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and paid on October 28. I will now turn the call back over to Bob. The other thing, Louis, though, '21 was the high point. So I would say that the underlying business is returning. We had some other events in 2021 that accelerated the margin a little bit higher. We had some one-off closeouts which were pretty strong. But I think in 2023, the underlying is getting back up well into the 8s, I would say. So maybe not all the way back up to the -- I think we were at 9% in 2021 but we're going to get underlying to be quite consistent with 2021. I'm sorry, Mike, you were breaking up. I was having trouble understanding you. I apologize. Yes. Okay, got that. All right. Thanks, Mike. So look, People & Places continue to show good margin profile and backlog as well. So I think that's obviously, a very critical part of our strategy. When we think about delivering more value-added solutions, the margin is it's got to come with it. So the backlog margin profile is better in People & Places and also it's better in PA as well. And the dynamic of PA relative to the Q4 number really was effectively the continued utilization we -- to get up to around 20%. We fell a little bit short of that but it's continuing to improve and we would expect that we'll get back up to those more normalized levels that we saw over the course of '22 -- early '22 relative to the margin profile there. Jamie, about the cash flow. Yes, we feel continued strength in our cash flow is expected over the course of 2023, that provides us degrees of freedom, to your point, about how we will deploy that additional capital that's available. So look, I think we continue to monitor the M&A front, I think we were very clear during our strategy as to where we would probably be focusing those ideas and thoughts relative to the 3 accelerators that we outlined in strategy and we're continuing to monitor those opportunities. There are things out there that are being evaluated obviously. Got to result in bid equalling ask where we feel like we can add an ROIC and a return profile to our shareholders that are appropriate; and so we'll see how that plays out. Of course, we also talked about during the prepared remarks, the proactive stance that we've been taking on the share repurchases. And so we feel like we're well positioned to be able to act when appropriate relative to a potential strategic opportunity and/or do share buybacks when there's market dislocation. Maybe I'll make some comments first and then have my partners here add any additional commentary to think appropriate. So look, I think we feel pretty good about the continuing resolution, given the makeup of the Senate and the House and how that's going to be coming together. And we just had a really deep dive review from a government relations team feeling pretty good about how things are going to play out over the course of this quarter. So we don't believe that there is going to be a continuing resolution that extends well into 2023. We're hoping that that will become resolved near the end of the calendar year. So I think that we're already starting to see, regardless of that continuing resolution, some momentum building relative to what Bob alluded to as -- and I made some comments on in terms of the cyber and intelligence business starting to get unlocked relative to bids being awarded and whatnot. So, we think that the combination of those 2 things are embedded into our guidance. And I feel -- we feel pretty good about it actually. So if you look at the ramp-up of the year, certainly, that large win is part of the equation but it ends up kind of building over the course of 2023. And so it's less of a direct impact in 2023. What we do believe and our view on the U.K. is that we've -- I guess, I would characterize us as being underwhelmed by the level of activity -- productive activity in the government which has actually put some pressure in the short term relative to the U.K. But with the recent budget that was announced and some of the activity of our clients is starting to look much better. So we're feeling like longer-term into 2023, that we're going to start to see some incremental momentum versus kind of what we've been seeing over the last, I'm going to call it, 6 months. So, we're feeling that things will start to improve. The other thing is that the backlog and the pipeline of PA, we're seeing no challenges associated with that. Seeing a little bit of the burn profile, as mentioned just earlier relative to the, I'm going to call it, the unknown relative to the U.K. government but we're starting to see that instance in that issue going away as we speak. So the business is effectively operational right now and we will be executing against the promise that we made relative to reporting that as a separate segment on the financials. So Sean, we're on track to do that. So I think that we'll -- we're going to provide additional color commentary because we're still working through all of the accounting mechanisms to make sure that our systems are reporting accurately and the controls are in place because it's a pretty large change. But I will tell you that it will be one of the highest growth areas that we're expecting in the company for 2023. And effectively, it will be a margin profile that will be growing substantially over time, a little bit lower in 2023 than what we expect at the exit rate. But at the end of the day, we'll provide a lot of details in Q1 relative to that. Well, look, if you think about the high single digits in terms of constant currency growth, I think that's pretty strong actually. And look, I think that the bottom line is -- for example, Bob just quoted the pipeline growth in the United States of near 20% kind of growth in the pipeline. It just takes a while for that to kind of [indiscernible] be won and then start to build the burn associated with it. So you're relying on your clients as much as you are anything else to be able to execute against that. And they're sometimes not as quick as we are ready to execute. So look, I think it's a growing momentum. And I think we're being prudent assuming how that's going to build over the course of 2023. The only one that -- we've called out the one at Kennedy which is -- that's a big one but we feel good about our position there. No. Look, the dynamic -- I don't have the FX dynamic specifically outlined but certainly, we can follow up with you, Andy, on that. But if you think about it, our corporate-related costs that support costs are embedded around the world. And so effectively, if you have U.K., for example, corporate-related costs, they're getting translated into a lower rate effectively. So the value of those costs go down and that effectively had some benefits associated with us because it's all -- it's effectively corporate costs and not corporate revenue. So if you get the difference between the two. And then look, we have known that the constant currency dynamic was still robust but we knew that the reported currency continued to be a challenge and we are very proactive in terms of taking steps to ensure that we reach the commitment levels that we had established for the company. So we pay attention to this and very, very proactive in terms of the management of our cost structure during Q4. Well, I will tell you that, as you may know, backlog is one of our incentive metrics. And I can assure you that our incentives are based on backlog continuing to show very strong growth year-over-year."

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. I'm honored to take on the role of CEO early next year and advance the exciting work underway to further diversify our capabilities and offerings, increasing opportunities and value for our people, our clients and our shareholders alike. I want to thank Steve for his partnership and guidance over the past 7 years. He is an incredible leader who inspires all around and will leave a tremendous legacy at Jacobs. I'll begin on Slide 6, discussing our People & Places Solutions business where we achieved strong top and bottom line results with backlog up 8% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency. With critical infrastructure priorities on the rise over the past year, our quarter results show that we've been successful in converting opportunity into accessible backlog. This success is underpinned by our global workforce which expanded 12% this year. For example, in FY '22, our advanced facilities operating -- advanced facilities unit operating profit grew by well over 25% and on a constant currency basis due to our scalable multi-geography delivery teams. Overall, we see our quarter results as Jacobs strategy in action. It's proof that Jacobs deep domain expertise can transform client outcomes, replacing conventional infrastructure delivery with modern data-enabled solutions. I'll discuss results under the themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization and climate response. Across these themes, I'll highlight how our technology and data solutions enable our success. First, supply chain diversification has led to expanded delivery for clients with long-term investment profiles that continue through changing economic conditions. In life sciences, our clients are in the middle of a generational expansion of therapeutics and vaccines as well as advanced health care and [indiscernible] on a global scale. Our confidential clients can accelerate production capacity for life-saving medicines for the most widespread chronic diseases by leveraging Jacobs' expertise in digital design to optimize delivery across multiple large-scale biotech campuses. We are also advising and delivering predictive analytics for point-of-care treatment resulting in improved outcomes for a growing and aging population with clients such as New South Wales Health Infrastructure in Australia, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. Jacobs remains uniquely positioned across the entire electric vehicle ecosystem to address all aspects of this rapidly expanding market from manufacturing capacity to EV charging infrastructure to advanced mobility implementation. With favorable tailwinds and expanding list of automobile and EV manufacturing clients are seeking Jacobs' leading support to develop sustainable production capacity. Moving to climate response. Global demand for affordable green energy led to an increase of over 33% in bookings with wins across multiple geographies, including the U.K.'s National Grid, U.S. Department of Energy, [indiscernible] of Energy in Korea where we're developing a new green hydrogen production and import facility. In the U.S., IIJA supported pipeline is building momentum and projects are moving through the sales cycle into delivery. For example, there is a broad focus on transportation decarbonization with support for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, NEVI, across multiple DOTs. Charging infrastructure for the navy and in multiple states under the low or no emission vehicle brand programs. For the environment agency in the U.K., we are living a digital proof of concept, leveraging spatial, predictive analytics to avoid extensive damage in human casualties due to flooding and other climate-driven disasters. At the same time, national highways chose us to streamline their complex data landscape, thanks to our cyber and digital capabilities, partnered with PA Consulting. With StreetLight Data's multimodal transportation insights platform, we've expanded opportunities for both traditional public sector transportation clients and new private sector clients to prioritize marketing and real estate investments. Water sector clients are investing in our new technologies, such as AquaDNA, Dragonfly and intelligent operations maintenance. These integrated AI and ML cloud-based technologies enable clients to provide reliable clean water access for all communities, leading to expanded services this quarter from wins in Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, the U.K., Singapore and Australia. These innovative platforms are driving the new standard for asset management. In Hawaii, we are delivering a 20-year installation development plan to address climate adaptation for the joint base Pearl Harbor hiccup. Under infrastructure modernization, mega program delivery trends continue as clients look for more efficient ways to deliver sustainable, liveable places. In Scandinavia, we are designing the Nord Aven tunnel to across the harbor in Copenhagen, Denmark. And in Toronto, MetroLinx recently awarded Jacobs a multiyear extension to support their $85 billion regional transit expansion. In summary, People & Places Solutions is positioned for long-term growth as evidenced by strong performance across all geographies and client segments. Clients are continuing to partner with Jacobs to deliver transformative infrastructure, advanced manufacturing expansion and energy security projects with sustainable lasting outcomes. Moving to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions line of business. CMS delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter with backlog remaining strong at $10.6 billion, flat year-over-year, with gross profit in backlog was up 10% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating diligent revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. CMS's service and solutions offerings are delivered across our core customer markets: space, cyber, intelligence, defense and energy. And we continue to see strong demand for our solutions across all of them. In space, Jacobs is a critical prime contractor to NASA's Artemis program, including being the key integrator of the successful uncrewed launch last week of the space launch system rocket in preparation to spend U.S. astronauts back to the moon by 2025. The Artemis 1 launch is historic and we are proud of Jacob's role in the mission. Also, we were awarded contracts by the Scottish rocket manufacturer and small sat launch service provider, Urbex, to help them build and operate a vertical launch site for satellites in the U.K. Several trends in other Jacobs key markets that we are seeing contributing to our continued growth include Zero Trust Architecture [ph], hypersonics and modular reactors. Beginning with Zero Trust Architecture or ZTA. White House Executive Order, 1028, mandates, adoption of ZTA cybersecurity models across the federal government. Importantly, ZTA requires continuous verification of identity as movers as users move laterally through network systems. Jacobs' cyber intelligence team which is now part of our new Divergent Solution operating unit is the program manager for one of the intelligence communities largest [indiscernible], responsible for identity, credential and access management, ICAM. ICAM is a critical architectural component of effective Zero Trust models and Jacobs' technical leadership in this area positions us to help clients across the federal government, meet the White House executive order. Our cyber and intelligence business unit has a significant pipeline of opportunities requiring ZTA adoption. In Q4, our cyber intelligence team also won several new non-ZTA contracts, including an agile software development and sustainment contract or a classified contract and one assisting the Navy to advance their radar sensing capability at the Naval Research Laboratory. We also recently cleared the protest period for a $470 million 6-year IDIQ, providing identity intelligence support to the DoD which is not yet reflected in backlog. Moving on to hypersonics. With advances in hypersonic missile technology by China and Russia, the U.S. Department of Defense is developing missile defenses to defend against hypersonic weapons and other emergent threats. Because hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of at least MAC 5, roughly 1 mile per second and can maneuver in route to their target, they are more difficult to defend against. Jacobs has decades of experience supporting the U.S. Air Force and NASA and has positioned itself as a leader in hypersonic solutions. In last quarter, Jacobs was awarded a 5-year $100 million IDIQ to help the U.S. Navy design and operate an underwater launch test system with the Naval Surface Warfare [ph]. The contract also covers modernization, design, fabrication and operation support for an in-air launch testing platform at the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake in California. Finally, demand for modular reactors. Nuclear power is coming into favor as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuels. For countries to achieve their next zero carbon emission goals and ensure energy independence and security, leaders are realizing they need to include the always-on emission-free generation. Small modular reactors or SMRs are reactors with electric generating capacity of 300 megawatts versus traditional large reactors with generating capacity of 1 gigawatt or more. SMRs have numerous benefits, including lower initial capital investment, greater scalability through factory manufacturing processes, greater siding flexibility on smaller grid and isolated areas and greater energy efficiency. In the U.K., we are delivering engineering and technical services to the Rolls-Royce SMR program and licensing advice to GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy as they look to enter the U.K. market. There's also increased interest in new advanced modular reactors or AMRs, that can be designed to provide specific benefits such as producing high heat for green hydrogen. We are supporting multiple AMR vendors in the U.S. and U.K. Jacobs is a leader in global nuclear solutions, building on our long legacy of organic capabilities and acquisitions of CH2M and Wood Nuclear. In summary, we continue to see solid revenue visibility for our solutions in FY '23 and with approximately 85% of CMS's portfolio, consisting of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than 4 years and 88% from federal level government funding. We are also pleased with the Government Accountability Office's recent guidance to have the U.S. Air Force re-evaluate proposals for its large Integrated Support Contract, ISC 2.0, in support of a new source selection decision. And therefore, this remains in our pipeline as a potential multibillion-dollar opportunity. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business at approximately $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Moving on to PA Consulting on Slide 8. PA continues to deliver its strategy and is securing exciting and enduring work. PA's deep insight lasting relationships and ability to assist clients through economic cycles is also generating consistent demand for its expertise. This quarter, PA was awarded marquee wins across the key markets. As Steve mentioned, in the U.K. public sector, where it's a major player, PA was selected as the lead systems integrator for a multiyear contract providing next-generation solutions to counter threats posed by radio-controlled improvised explosive devices, IED. The contract leverages PA's extensive experience in major program delivery as they lead the delivery consortium, Team Protect. PA was also appointed to oversee the delivery of a once-in-a-generation program for social care reform in the U.K., further cementing its position in government and public sector. Transport continues to be a major focus with additional awards won at Schipol Airport in the Netherlands, where the joint capabilities of Jacobs and PA continue to create further opportunities to include boardroom advisory and digitalization of airside operations. The Jacobs PA partnership is strongly positioned to continue to capitalize on substantial market opportunities. Jacobs' global footprint and broad-based domain expertise together with PA's high-end digital consulting, creates a compelling value proposition in distinct areas of opportunity. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 14. As we discussed throughout our remarks, through proactive portfolio management, we have aligned our business to sectors that continue to demonstrate robust growth through multiple economic scenarios. We continue to enhance our overall growth rate with our climate response consulting and advisory and data solutions strategic accelerators. Given the volatility of FX rates, we are providing our outlook under 2 FX scenarios: one, an outlook based on constant currency which provides greater insight of underlying business performance; and two, an outlook based on more recent FX rates. Although we transact in multiple currencies, one example for reference is the pound sterling. The full year 2022 average conversion rate for the pound sterling was $1.28 compared to $1.15 early November 2022. As footnote in our earnings release and investor presentation, based on fiscal 2022 average rate, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.465 billion to $1.545 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.90, up 10% and 12%, respectively, at the midpoint. Based on rates in early November, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.20 to $7.50, both up 6% at the midpoint. On a net revenue basis, the difference between these 2 scenarios is approximately $430 million. Looking beyond fiscal 2023, we remain confident achieving double-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, consistent with our strategic plan. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. We do, Bert. The tailwinds that we see in the markets that we're certain, we stand by those commitments that we made on the -- in the '24 strategic line. Sure. So let me answer the first question. On the semiconductor spend, the industry as a whole from a demand standpoint is in a bit of soft period. The client base and the geographies that we're working in, we have not seen that. And so the front end, the design work, the momentum that we've seen over the course of the last 6 to 8 quarters, that has not slowed at all. And so we're feeling comfortable about where we sit in that ecosystem of consultants to that, specifically with our client base. So we're positive on that front. On IIJA, we actually -- we are seeing those projects that we have been tracking through the development of both grants as well as the formula funding coming to fruition. Probably the bigger element to that is that the release of those monies is actually unlocking the base funding that the states previously, specifically during COVID, had locked up not knowing kind of what the future looks like. So overall, the pipeline is up on the U.S. basis and infrastructure. Our pipeline is up of 4% to 5% -- I'm sorry, 5% without IIJA, 18% with IIJA from a pipeline standpoint; so we are seeing that. Thank you. So both question, Louie, the answer is yes. The award -- the 2 awards that Steve and I specifically spoke about are coming in through those 2 at a portals or through those relationships that we had and the acquisitions that we made during that period. So we are seeing that. They are margin accretive. This -- the flip side of this is that these are awards that we had expected in previous quarters. And we talked about it a lot in previous earnings calls, that the knock-on effect of the CR has now had an effect on kind of when those things start. So we do see margins going up and these are serving as catalysts for that too. Thank you, Jerry. Yes, Jerry, obviously something that we've been -- I've been thinking about a lot. Maybe a couple of precursor comments and then directly to the question. The precursor comment was and I tried to infer -- say it almost explicitly, the way Steve has run the executive team and the company has been really very inclusive. And so when you look at our strategy, not just the one that we released last March but even in '16 and '19, that's a strategy that was developed by all of us as a team. So it's not me coming in with a new strategy. I feel very, very bought in and tied to with the strategy that we have. So the first big area around our clients. The accelerators that we have are the national and global priorities that are driving the world. And so that's going to continue to drive our business as we come up with more technology-enabled and client-driven type solutions. The second is around investments in our people. Our people have delivered time and time again over decades. But if you look at the profile of our people, although our business is weighted towards the U.S., our -- we have about a 55-45 U.S. versus outside of the U.S. profile of our people, really driven around that global delivery that we've counted for so long. And so those investments and continued driving around inclusion and diversity and sourcing talent from all over the world is going to be really, really important. And the last piece I'd say is around resilience. Resilience in our business with regards to our systems and how we run the company but also simplicity of our business. We've diversified the business and we've tried to have direct access to our clients. But making that -- having simplicity in the forefront is really key as well. So kind of segregated in those 3 main areas. Thanks, Andy. Just to put some -- just to quantify Kevin's last comment, the pipeline growth in PA alone this quarter was 52% year-on-year. So the pipeline continues to grow. And the way we evaluate pipeline within the PA world, since it's a pure-play consultancy, are projects, programs, engagements where we already actually have started a bit of them, too. So these are promising as well as the programs that were announced in the budget that Kevin referenced. Other programs that PA and Jacobs are actually partnered on right now. So that's -- hence, the bit of positivity there along with some realism of the last couple of months on what's gone down. Sorry, Chad, you were a little broken up there. Can you repeat the question? Okay. Infrastructure, was that -- that part? Yes, got it. Okay. In infrastructure, the opportunities continue to grow. I'd say broadly driven mostly in the U.S. but we're seeing this and Steve talked about the international -- I'm sorry, Kevin talked about the international business but heavily geared towards transportation and water with a growing profile around energy transition. And so those are kind of the 3 main areas. Environmental continues to be robust. So, we see those -- I mean, the pipeline growth I talked about before, has been really, really strong. On the acquisitions, that's a business where StreetLight Data probably was the last -- the one that we did, it was a smaller acquisition. And we are immediately seeing fit that we had anticipated in the deal kind of thesis around StreetLight all around that data-enabled [indiscernible] data in driving a different type of solution for our clients. They had clients before, predominantly the state DOTs in the U.S. but that's been expanded with our relationships. And then we're seeing private sector utilization too, as private sector firms have looked at the use of data in order to cite different investments that they're making from a capital project perspective; so very positive news on that front. If I could add, Kevin, while we're adding on those end markets that do have a quicker burn profile, all 3 of us today talked about the growth in advanced facilities where that has been a catalyst for growth. So though the top line might be in those numbers that were quoted, I did think -- we did say on a constant currency basis, our bottom line growth would be double digits. So I think there's some real optimism in the portfolio. Sure. I'd say that the recompete exposure in '23 is moderate to low. We -- it's predominantly in our CMS business and we've already gotten some real positive indications of some of those larger ones that are -- I say there's only a couple. So I would not characterize that as a big exposure in '23. Maybe I could you like to add one more thing, just on what drives backlog which is sales at, we've put a tremendous amount we've been a sales-driven company for since inception. I think Dr. Jacob started that mantra. Our sales-driven growth and the investments we've made, [indiscernible] now our new Chief Growth Officer as well, has been very, very specific as our portfolio has developed over the period -- this most recent period of time. So we're putting the full force effort on our sales effort as the pipeline continues to grow; so timing is good. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. I'm looking forward to providing further updates on our progress and upcoming events and calls. Have a -- for those of you in the U.S., have a wonderful Thanksgiving."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 business performance and 2023 outlook. As I transition to Jacobs' Executive Chair, I'm excited and confident about the next phase of our strategy boldly moving forward. This strategy continues to unlock and elevate our transformed high-performance culture to capture significant growth opportunities we've identified across climate response, consulting advisory and data solutions, while benefiting from the recurring nature and diversity of our core businesses. From a financial standpoint, we believe the rigorous execution of this strategy will result in enhanced long-term revenue growth and expansion in our profit margin profile. During our last 2 strategies, we maintained a focus on continuing to reshape our business through organic investments, acquisitions and divestitures. And by doing so, we were able to deliver value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Since we started our journey together in 2016, we intentionally transformed our culture and our brand, grew revenue and expanded profit margins, leading to a total shareholder return of approximately 250%, almost twice the return of the S&P 500. We believe the next phase will be equally as transformative as we maintain our brand promise of challenging today and reinventing tomorrow. Let's now discuss our fourth quarter results. We're seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in our sales pipelines in a number of marquee recent wins which underscores our strategy. During the quarter, net revenue grew 6% year-over-year and grew 11% on a constant currency basis with another quarter of constant currency growth across each line of business. Backlog was up 5% from the prior year's quarter and 8% on a constant currency basis. Within People & Places Solutions, our advanced facilities business again posted double-digit year-over-year top line and operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. And the remaining P&PS units in constant currency also experienced year-over-year growth. During the current quarter, Critical Mission Solutions is beginning to see previously delayed opportunities into the final stages with a major cyber win last week and with another win close to clearing the protest period. PA Consultancy and -- PA Consulting in constant currency continued to show strong Q4 growth with revenue up 9% and backlog up 8% year-over-year. PA successfully won a large multiyear contract with the Ministry of Defense to secure the next-generation soldier in what's proving to be a digitally enabled battlefield. From a full year standpoint, we finished the year within our original guidance range, even when recognizing the translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar with double-digit net revenue and operating profit growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss an element of our data solutions accelerator that's housed within the Divergent Solutions business unit which we will formally break out starting in our fiscal first quarter of 2023. We have consolidated the majority of our software and data solutions into a single unit to gain benefits from consistent product management, marketing and research and development. Our data solutions are aligned to 3 high-growth verticals of transportation, water and national security. A competitive differentiation of our vertical software platforms is access and integration of unique data sets and the ability to turn that data into actionable outcomes for our customers. For example, our StreetLight Data platform is a SaaS solution that ingests a variety of mobility data sources into proprietary algorithms that provide data analytics for both traditional transportation clients and giga projects within the broader infrastructure market. Our GeoPod technology creates mapping data for multiple confidential customers as they plan for autonomous driving, precision agriculture and other aerial surveillance requirements. In water, we continue to leverage smart algorithms developed by our domain experts to optimize our clients' operations and maintenance, both AquaDNA and our intelligent and our intelligent O&M solution can save 10% to 30% in energy use for wastewater treatment. We continue to expand our water solutions across our clients' assets life cycle. From a national security standpoint, our extreme search solution has proprietary algorithms and compute ability that can rapidly search large volumes of real-time or log data. One critical use case is quickly finding indicators of compromise to prevent cyber breaches. Given the significant amount of data that will be created and utilized in IT and OT environments, we believe the applications of these types of solutions are in the early stages of decades of robust growth. Before I turn the call over to Bob, first, I'd like to thank the amazing people at Jacobs for living our values and progressing our culture over the last several years. Every single day, Jacobs is providing critical solutions globally. For example, most recently, supporting NASA for the Artemis launch to the move or consulting on green hydrogen solutions for sovereign nations, delivering world-scale biotechnology manufacturing solutions, remediating harmful PaaS chemicals from our water or planning autonomous transportation for the city of the future. It is truly our people that make Jacobs a company like no other. Now, I'd like to congratulate Bob on his appointment to CEO and say that I'm excited to have experienced a dynamic leader who brings decades of industry domain knowledge and a proven track record to lead our boldly moving forward strategy into the future. Bob? Thanks, Bert. Thanks, Louie Yes. It's Steve here, Jamie. So I can speak for both the Board and management around that question is we, first of all, the whole strategy around Divergent Solutions was to break out the elements of CMS that are highly consistent, especially with the data solutions side of our 3 accelerators; and so obviously [indiscernible]. We're excited about that. That's where we're really going to see accelerated margin growth, especially with these recent cyber wins that we've talked about but also across the entire platform. And then when you get into the remaining CMS business, just as an example, nuclear most recently has been surging with regard to becoming a clean energy transition solution. And as you know, we're a major player in nuclear, not just in the remediation side but the new build side, especially in the new technology of advanced small modular reactors. So, we're excited about the future of those and we'll continue to monitor the entire company as far as fit, et cetera, long term, as we've done in the past. And I mentioned in my remarks but we're very optimistic about the CMS business as we move into 2023. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures, and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons the current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including StreetLight Data and BlackLynx, as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full fiscal period.\nKen: Steve will begin by reviewing our third quarter results, and then discuss our Jacobs and PA accelerating social impact. Bob will then review our performance by line of business, Ken will provide an update on PA Consulting, and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion about financial metrics as well as review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide details on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we have provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: All right, thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our near term outlook. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to be conducting today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call on PA Consulting offices in London and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide more color in just a moment on our strong early on success of our investment in PA. But first turning to Slide 4, at Jacobs the combination of a proactive approach to strategic portfolio management and driving a high performance culture has created a touch quality business with substantial recurring revenue that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resilient during a variety of macroeconomic conditions. This is complemented by our focus on secular growth in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions. Our competitive advantage is based on strength staying true to our values. We harness a deep technical expertise to reinvent the way we solve problems and chase the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients. As I shift to the quarterly results, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly seeing strong underlying trends in accelerated growth at Jacobs. From the velocity of our sales pipeline, our recent major wins that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about today and next quarter, to increasing trends in utilization, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re positioned for strong profitable growth going forward. During the quarter net revenue grew 8% year-over-year and double digits on a constant currency basis, with growth across each line of business. More importantly, bookings were strong across the company, resulting in revenue backlog up 10% year-over-year and actually up 13% in constant currency. We saw continued strong performance in our Advanced Facilities business as demonstrated by our 25% year-over-year top line growth and an acceleration in P&PS  bookings during the quarter within our Americas business, driven by awards related to the U.S. infrastructure modernization. Within Critical Mission Solutions, we were awarded a strategic $3.9 billion NASA Johnson 10-year rebate significantly larger than our existing contract and which will be added to our backlog in the fourth quarter. This is one of many long-term recurrent contracts that provide revenue visibility for the business. On a constant currency basis, PA Consulting continued to show strong growth with revenue up 22% and backlog up 19% year-over-year. The strong visibility of our diverse business with upside from secular growth trends combined with robust cash flow generation affords us the ability to generate returns for our shareholders in times of economic uncertainty. Now turning to Slide 5. This time two years ago in the height of the pandemic we were zeroing in on the PA Consulting transaction, and PA  is significantly exceeding our financial expectations and revenue synergies are accelerating. Results are strong across all PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peak performance indicators. In Culture and Talent the number of partners has increased more than 20% since the transaction closed, with additional key hires across operations, research, technology and sales, further strengthening PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities in client solutions. And very exciting is their women and leadership program with the current PA leadership team now at 50% female. Financial performance continues strong with the weighted pipeline up more than 40% compared to the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date revenues are up 20% in constant currency with an operating margin of 21%, which is an indicator of PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high quality business. On the Operations and Strategy front, PA is seeing success following the launch of it IP monetization, and they are gaining momentum in the U.S. with new leadership and an expanding portfolio. And in the area of revenue synergies we have posted 18 joint wins since the beginning of the partnership and are seeing significant collaborative opportunities in multiple markets, including health and life sciences, energy and utilities, and consumer products. Our partnership with PA has been one of the most successful in value creating investments and our Consulting and Advisory accelerator is a clear priority for future capital deployment. Turning to Slide 6. A key to our successful partnership has been the close alignment of our purpose around creating solutions that have positive social impact, whether it's working together to improve healthcare for families through leading edge cell and gene therapy, addressing patient safety and emergency departments across the U.S., solving issues of connectivity and decarbonization for global rail market, delivering resilient solutions in the areas of deforestation and fire prevention in the UK, and the undergrounding of 10,000 miles of cable for PG&E to mitigate forest fires in California, and on the clean energy front, collaborating on analyzing investments for private equity and green hydrogen. Once again, looking ahead, we believe our partnership with TA is critical to delivering our new Jacobs strategy. Now I'll turn it over to Bob Pragada to discuss our line of businesses.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued its strong performance in the third quarter with total backlog increasing 7% on a reported basis and reported on a pro forma basis to $10.2 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient, recurring revenue growth and market expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Our service and solution offering are delivered across our core customers markets, space, national security, cyber intelligence, and energy environment and we are leveraging our growth accelerators of data solutions, climate response in Consulting and Advisory to catalyze the business. We have substantial revenue visibility as approximately 85% of CMS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolio consists of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than four years and 88% from federal level government funding. Although economic and geopolitical uncertainties continue, our strong Q3 ending backlog gives us confidence in our next 12 months forecast of revenue. Three market trends that we see contributing to our continued growth include space debris management, robotics, and 5G network build out. Beginning with space debris management, decades of space travelers resulted in large amounts of space debris damage to the satellites and future launches, adding to the cost of operating satellites and other space platforms like the International Space Station or ISS. If debris destroys a satellite, it can take months and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to restore its service. We support the orbital debris tracking program at NASA and provide plume analysis and communication systems, simulation for vehicles visiting the ISS. In addition, we provide media tracking data for multiple government agencies. Space debris tracking is one of many services Jacobs provides on the recently awarded Johnson Engineering, Technology and Science or JETS II contract with builds on Jacobs more than 17 years of continuous support at Johnson Space Center. Under this contract, we will provide multidisciplinary technical services to support the future of human space exploration, as well as help NASA incubate the emerging commercial space economy. This 10-year $3.9 billion win will book in Q4 and represents a $1.8 billion increase to our existing contract. This serves to illustrate the continuing strong, massive Jacobs partnership. Moving on to robotics. We are increasingly delivering valued solutions to our clients by utilizing robots that reduce costs and increase accuracy and safety in otherwise manual human processes. And we're excited to announce the last quarter we integrated the Resolve robotics team in the UK into CMS, who brings software expertise and IP to help accelerate our growth. Our existing CMS robotics team already delivers groundbreaking innovations, developing and deploying robotics systems in challenging environments such as the robotic tool to retrieve sand like debris from inside a damaged nuclear reactor at Fukushima in Japan, autonomous systems to map riverbeds for the British army, and designing robotic systems for ITER, the world's largest fusion power experiment. Finally demand for 5G telecommunications. Our telecom group provides full solutions for the deployment of next generation wireless and wireline networks for leading telecommunication companies like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as Fortune 1000 healthcare and commercial companies looking to build their own 5G networks. We also support the infrastructure market providing 5G integration, network optimization, and technical services alongside our PMPs teams to accelerate growth. While rollout of 5G infrastructure deployment is still in its early ramp phase, we continue to see increased demand for both integrated 4G and 5G solutions from our commercial telco infrastructure, healthcare and government clients. During the quarter, our telecom group added several new awards, total more than $150 million to deliver projects advancing 5G nationwide. We are excited for the team's recent successes and are well positioned for growth as adoption of 5G use cases and penetration growth. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our CMS solutions. Last week, we were notified that we were awarded a $470 million, six-year cyber and intelligence related task order, which we expect to benefit and begin ramping at the end of this current quarter. The sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business pipeline at approximately $25 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Turning to Slide 8, during the quarter, People & Places Solutions delivered record setting, quarterly bookings that topped pre-pandemic levels. We also enjoyed year-over-year bookings growth of 11% and backlog growth of 13%, delivering a high mark for operating profit in the quarter. Despite macroeconomic concerns, we performed well due to the balance of public and private sector clients with a multinational focus, resulting in continued high percentage of revenue already booked in backlog. As I talk about the quarter, I'll address our four ongoing themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization, climate response, and data solutions. Starting with supply chain diversification. With continued breakthroughs in biotechnology, strong customer demand and robust operating cash flow, life sciences clients are investing in manufacturing expansion and contract operations capacity globally. As a leader in the market, tier one clients have confidence in Jacobs ability to deliver highly complex Greenfield and expansion projects at speed that provides time to market for our clients, that maximizes their competitive advantage in new therapeutics. Growing health service needs are leading to innovative approaches to care. We are optimizing facilities for clients, such as the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, where we serve as their project delivery partner. We are improving sustainability access and energy efficiency for NHS Scotland, as well as increasing much needed access to critical mental healthcare in Australia. We continue to see robust demand for semiconductor chips, data center capacity expansion, and growth in the electric vehicle market and have secured recent confidential wins in all three categories. On top of strong secular demand for semiconductors, we are pleased to see the passing of the $53 billion U.S. CHIPS Bill, which will incentivize investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and specialized tools. Infrastructure modernization. Increased client investments in mega and giga scale infrastructure continues, and with our number one ENR ranking in program management, our delivery reputation has been a key differentiator in staying ahead of our client's needs in a dynamic global environment. We recently have been awarded several strategic full lifecycle programs for new transformative scale cities in the Middle East that will address social, economic and climate priorities, and we'll have flexible and long-term contracting vehicles. With a renewed interest in equitable, sustainable transportation, we are experiencing a significant investment in the transit and rail sector with wins across the globe, such as Irish Rail, British Railways, multiple clients in Australia and resilient transit planning for Sacramento area Council of Governments here in the U.S. The infrastructure investment in JOBS Act is resulting in a steady increase in new project awards to modernize and increase the resiliency of U.S. infrastructure. For example, we won a major water supply resilience program for Eastern New Mexico Water Utility Authority, a five-year storm water implementation program for the City of Baton Rouge, and a funding strategy with Oklahoma DoT. Additionally, our IIJA advisory team is positioning our clients to win funding opportunities with over 50 differentiated grant applications across transportation, water, and energy. We anticipate additional awards in the coming quarters as the opportunities in our sales pipeline move into the next phase of procurement. Moving to Climate Response. We see our clients continuing to invest in clean energy across all sectors with primary spend related to grid modernization, cost effective renewable energy generation and EV Charging Infrastructure or EVCI. Our progress in these areas is demonstrated globally. In Asia through advisory and policy consulting for the Asia Development Bank, in Canada with a pipeline utility program, in Australia through transmission and distribution design projects with AusNet Services, and in the U.S. via New Consulting and Advisory framework to advance energy transition with a leading provider. Transportation electrification and advanced charging infrastructure plans have topped our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agendas across all regions for aviation, ports, highways and rail and transit. This includes projects for Heathrow Airport in the UK to implement landside EBCI, Ohio DoT Statewide EV Infrastructure program, and a major U.S. Transportation Authority transitioning operations to zero emissions for one of the world's largest bus fleets by 2040. Collectively, this is a very exciting space for us and aligns strongly with our climate response accelerator. Moving to Data Solutions. We are using advanced data analytics to optimize our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decision making as well as their ability to de-risk long-term investments. For example, in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board, our StreetLight Data team is using advanced analytics to better measure and manage transportation emissions. We are also continuing our technology consulting support for a U.S. State DoT with integrated corridor management, connected automated transportation systems, and other advanced mobility solutions to maximize use of their existing transportation infrastructure. In the water market we are awarded a contract with the Water Research Foundation to develop the first full scale deployment of machine learning, predictive control for wastewater systems, a new technology to advance the global water industry. Our Cyber and Digital Services teams were awarded projects in support of the Operational Technology Resiliency plan for a major UK utility network operator. And in Australia, we have secured the Digital and Data Advisory Services scope to support advanced analytics across Brisbane City Council's entire asset lifecycle. In summary, our strong sales pipeline is supported by well-funded government budgets to modernize their infrastructure and commercial clients that are addressing secular growth opportunities. The agility of our global workforce, combined with elevated spend on transformative, complex infrastructure, uniquely positions us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Given these dynamics and the visibility of our revenue in backlog, we are excited in the growth trajectory for our People and Places business, both now and into the future.\nKen:\nKen Toombs: Thanks Bob. Moving to Slide 9, PA's current quarter continued to see strong sales bookings up 25% and backlog was up 19% in constant currency. Here's what I see driving that. We've unique value proposition that starts with our purpose, bringing ingenuity to life to build a positive human future. This enables us to deliver both , but our purpose is critical in our ability to attract and retain top talent. Our differentiation extends to our strategy, which is focused on helping clients address some of the biggest forces shaping society with our unique end-to-end innovation offering. Indeed having technologists, scientists, engineers, and designers working together creates a unique set of propositions. Let me shift gears and talk a bit about our partnership with Jacobs. As Steve mentioned, our partnership supports key aspects of our strategy. We have numerous key accounts in common. Those accounts are ones where we can leverage PA's relationships at the C-suite to bring Jacobs into the mix early and create a differentiated solution. In some cases it could be the advantage of scale that Jacobs has or a specialized expertise. It can also work the opposite way where Jacobs has a key relationship and brings PA into complex deals. A great example is PG&E in California, where Jacobs has a strong existing relationship. The differentiation on this project was a combination of Jacob's program management expertise with PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategic consultancy advice and deep domain expertise. And more than a year into the partnership, these types of opportunities are growing. Another area of our strategy is expansion in the United States, where the outlook is very promising with strong double digit revenue growth over the last six months. Beyond the synergies with Jacobs, we see a big demand for our end-to-end services. We're focused on three sectors in particular, energy and utilities, health and life sciences and consumer and manufacturing. In each of these areas we're winning and delivering exciting purpose-driven work. For example, innovating cell and gene therapy manufacturing with Ori Biotech and creating a growth strategy for Green Boom, a startup, which has developed a sustainable way to prevent, reduce and clean up oil spills. Over time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made several U.S. acquisitions which have provided a platform for further organic growth. Additionally, the significant hiring of great new talent at the partner level is another way we are stimulating growth. Since the beginning of 2020, we've grown the number of U.S. partners by 60%. Now I'd like to spend a minute on resiliency of our business. We enjoy a loyal client base with approximately 90% of revenue typically coming from repeat clients over the last five years and our expertise continues to be in high demand. We also enjoy resiliency, given our balance in private and public sector work. For example, during the pandemic, we transformed entire corporate business models to account for new customer behaviors. While in the public sector, we work with some of the biggest government agencies that provide critical services that are largely unaffected by short term budget decisions, like the UK National Health Service and Ministry of Justice. This helps to mitigate risk from future macroeconomic trends. So to summarize, we're running a purpose-driven business with a clear strategy to address our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 biggest challenges in an end-to- end manner that separates us from the competition. And structurally we're set up to be able to pivot in response to external factors, ensuring we're well positioned for the future. Kevin, I'll hand it over to you.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Ken. I'm going to Slide 10 for a financial overview of third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 7% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Pro forma for acquired revenue, net revenue also grew 7% year-over-year, which is an acceleration in growth from the second quarter. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly 400 basis points. And given current foreign exchange spot rates, we expect FX to impact our Q4 revenue by nearly 450 basis points on a year-over-year basis. On a reported basis for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, which translates into double digit growth on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, down 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by our CMS line of business related to newly ramping remediation contracts and the timing of the ramp on higher margin federal contracts, and the investment in incremental resources in PA in advance of expected growth.\nP&PS: GAAP operating profit was $266 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal related costs and restructuring efforts of $10 million with over half of that associated with integration costs associated with acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit was $327 million, up 4% year-over-year on both a reported and pro forma basis. On a constant currency basis adjusted operating profit was up 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit and net revenue was 10.3% and we expect a similar level in Q4. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.52 and included a $0.27 impact related to our amortization, charge of acquired intangibles, $0.04 from transaction related costs, only $0.02 of other restructuring costs and a $0.01 benefit adjustment to align to our effective tax rate. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.86, up 13% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis FX impacted our EPS negatively by $0.09. Within the other income line on the P&L, important to note, we realized a cash pretax gain of approximately $14 million or $0.08 in after tax EPS from the sale of our ownership and commercial cybersecurity provider WatchGuard Technologies that came as part of the KEYW acquisition. This benefit was captured within our other income line and adjusted EBITDA, but not reflected in operating profit results. The sale of this strategic investment was driven by contract terms associated with our interests, which would have limited future monetization of our investment. We remain excited about our continued partnership with WatchGuard. Jacobs consolidated Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $363 million and was up nearly 13% year-over-year representing 11.4% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year. Finally turning to our bookings during the quarter, the revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 times and did not include the estimated $550 million backlog value of the 10-year $3.9 billion for NASA Johnson win, which will be recognized in backlog in our fourth quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, the contract ceilings of this rebid win is significantly higher than our existing contract and is an agency-wide contract not limited to Johnson Space Center. We've planned a backlog for the first two years of the approximate current revenue run rate, but expect on contract growth to the ceiling value over the life of the contract. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q3 revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by over 200 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to approach double digits and after adjusting for an estimated FX impact of 250 basis points, deliver constant currency double digit growth. Q3 CMS operating profit was $104 million, down 3.5% year-over-year, but flat on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was down over 90 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%. Q3 operating profit margin percentage continued to be impacted by the delay of the higher margin, shorter cycle awards that were pushed to the right due to the continuing resolution, as well as related timing of our investments ahead of new cyber and intelligence contract wins. Due to these investments and the timing of both new and anticipated awards, we expect CMS operating profit margin to remain under 8% for the fourth quarter, but improving in 2023 and beyond. Moving to People & Places, Q3 net revenue accelerated to 7% year-over-year, both including a negative effect of 350 basis points from FX. On a constant currency basis, P&PS overall grew double digits year-over-year. Also on a constant currency basis, each People & Places segment demonstrated net revenue growth with strong year-over-year growth acceleration in our America's business as impact from U.S. infrastructure spending begins to materialize. Our Advanced Facilities business continues to demonstrate robust double digit net revenue growth with strong performance in both semiconductors and life sciences. We expect this performance to continue given our strong backlog in sales pipeline. Our International business growth on a constant currency basis also remained strong as those governments continue to prioritize infrastructure modernization and investments related to our ESG Solutions. Total P&PS Q3 gross profit grew year-over-year and gross margins were consistent with Q3 2021, with Q3 operating profit up 2% year-over-year and up 8% when eliminating the impact from FX translation. In terms of PA's performance, PA revenue grew 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, and impressive 22% in PA's local currency. Q3 adjusted operating profit margin was 18.5% due to lower utilization, but still up 2% when factoring the impact of currency. The lower utilization during Q3 was driven by a proactive effort to add resources for additional growth expected in 2022 and 2023 for the PA team. Consequently, we expect PAs operating profit margin to return to greater than 20% next quarter and continue to strengthen further in 2023. We also expect continued double digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our unallocated corporate costs were $38 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from continuing moderation in medical costs and to a lesser extent from a positive currency impact on our support costs and other benefits. We now expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million versus our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Turning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid underlying cash flow generation. On a reported basis free cash flow was a negative $281 million, but included a $480 million cash outflow related to the previously discussed Inpex legal settlement, as well as $10 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding these outflows, free cash flow was strong and conversion was in line with our expectations. DSOs were relatively flat year-over-year. We expect solid free cash flow in the fourth quarter, again in light with our previous conversion expectations for the full year. During the quarter we repurchased approximately $200 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares as we see dislocation in the market. As a result of the strong underlying cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and a gross debt of $3.6 billion, resulting in $2.5 billion of net debt. Our net debt to adjusted 2022 expected EBITDA of approximately 1.8 times is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate pre-payable debt and as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward, which we have incorporated into our outlook. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which we recently announced. Before I turn it back to Steve I'd like to talk about the resiliency of our portfolio. The portfolio is strong and resilient, aligned around high priority Federal Government spend areas and state and local institutions supported by government stimulus programs. The private sector business is centered on high margin markets like semiconductors and life sciences, which are currently focused on incremental investment and capacity to resolve supply chain constraints and support novel therapies. As a result, while we may not be totally immune to the global economic uncertainties, we are confident that we are positioned to deliver the levels of growth identified in our strategy. Over to you, Steve.\nSteve Demetriou: All right, thank you, Kevin. As Kevin described we have a diverse portfolio with significant reimbursable recurring revenue, and it provides us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios, and manage the impacts of inflationary pressures on our business. With this diversity comes some exposure to foreign currency translation as we have approximately 34% of our revenue outside of the U.S. with 21% of that revenue in UK Pound Sterling. As a result of the latest foreign exchange dynamics, we're providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter of adjusted EBITDA in the range of $340 million to $360 million and an adjusted EPS of $1.75 to $1.85 with the midpoints tied to the current FX rates. We feel very confident in our underlying business trends in the fourth quarter, and it provided the lower end of the range to reflect the possibility of any FX erosion. It is important to note that relative to our fiscal 2022 forecast back in November, foreign currency translation has impacted our full year expected fiscal 2022 net revenue outlook by approximately $320 million, adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million and adjusted EPS by nearly $0.20 to ensure our change in annual guidance and EPS is effectively driven by currency volatility versus our original expectations. In closing, we are excited about the momentum across all of our business as demonstrated by our accelerating revenue growth, our strong bookings and backlog, and a robust sales pipeline globally. Operator, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now open the call for questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from a line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook:\nWatchGuard:\nKevin Berryman: First point relative to client, look we're really not sensing any significant commentary from clients which are indicating concerns on the impact to their business associated with their investment profile. And look, if you look at the, I'm going to call it the private parts of the portfolio, specifically the life sciences and semiconductors, those clients are really continuing to be quite robust in their outlook.\nWatchGuard, yes:\nOperator: Your next question\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nSteve Demetriou: The only thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d add\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Go ahead operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Hi, hey, good morning.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nKevin Berryman: Good morning, Bert.\nBert Subin: Bob, you mentioned the CHIPS Bill in your prepared marks. How much of a tailwind, if any, should we expect that to be for your fab design business? And then just to a, just a quick follow up to what you were talking about on the resilient side, is it fair to think that the PA consulting would be sort of the most volatile piece of your business as we think about sort of going through a potential economic recession? Thanks.\nBob Pragada: Yes. Bert on the first part on the CHIPS Bill, I think the way that we're thinking about it is, is that, that was already such a robust business for us based on the clientele that we have and what the business drivers were for them. But the CHIPS Bill did go as quick, even more credibility as well as substantiation of continued growth for those clients that are actually changing their business model. So I think it's putting more confidence that the cycle that we used to talk about being traditional 18 to 36 months cycles going even further with now support from the Federal Government, so we're, we're excited about that. With regards to the volatility in PA's business, you know, its \u00e2\u0080\u0093 PA is very unique model. It's structured where the traditional management consultant relying on discretionary spend of their clients for business transformation activities is not really where PA sits. PA sits in product innovation and in using that product innovation to transform businesses and so these are really at the core of the clients that they serve. So we're not really seeing -- we're not seeing that as evidenced by the bookings trends that we saw with PA this quarter being at the highest that they've been eventually ever which is really putting some credibility in the backlog moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you just expand Kevin on the, hi. Kevin if you wouldn't mind just expanding on the margin comments in your prepared remarks for Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places exiting the fourth fiscal quarter. You know, it sounds like you've got some idiosyncratic moving pieces that might impact normal seasonality as we head into the December quarter. Can you just tease that out a bit based on contract cadence, et cetera, that you alluded to for full fiscal year 2023? Thanks.\nKevin Berryman: Yes, Jerry couple of points. First is on the win profile associated with our CMS business, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been ramping some of the big environmental contracts, the nuclear remediation contracts, which are embedded into our forecast, which as you know, is lower margin. And we've previously discussed that the balance of the year would start to see an uptick in margins because of all of the shorter cycle and cyber and intelligence wins, which are coming. And actually Bob announced that one was, we just heard about this this week actually, and so, or last week and so look at the end of the day, all of those are happening. They're just not happening and won't ramp in Q4 which was our original expectation. So if you look at that dynamic, that puts a little bit of pressure on the Q4 margin that we have in addition to continue to have the investment profile and we're not backing off of that in Q4 because of the anticipation of the growth in 2023 and beyond. So it's a double kind of double impact on Q4, but ultimately then translates into 2023 starting to rebound and come back into the margin profile that we've seen in the past. Now it's going to take a while to get there, but ultimately we're confident that the margin profile will start to kick back up in 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on that discussion about the cyber contracts and you mentioned that $500 million one, I guess that's the one from last week, and I guess I'd call that a mid-sized award compared to the NASA type opportunities. Can you just talk a little bit more about how much more of that you have in the pipeline and the timing of those and then how relatively important they are to that 2023 plan?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, so Steve here. Yes, the good news is we actually had two wins in the last 30 days in the cyber intelligence business. There was a $500 million one that did get booked late in the third quarter, and then we've had one just in the last week that Kevin just talked about that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just under $500 million. And those are two good sized cyber intelligence awards with better margins than some of our longer term enterprise contracts that we have in CMS. So they're going be margin are creative and we're really going to see those playing out as early as, you know, as far as the P&L in the first quarter of 2023. So, and then on top of that, we have about $1.5 billion of things that could hit sometime in the fourth quarter, as far as pursuits out there, and if you look at our normal win rate, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to add on top of that. And then on the back of that, there's a series of other pursuit opportunities that will play out sometime in the first half of 2023. So we're, you know, we are excited about cyber intelligence, a little frustrated that it's taken a few quarters longer than we had expected. And then I just want to add on the back of that outside of cyber intelligence, which also gives us some optimism is that the Americas IIJA initiatives, we are clearly seeing momentum now in that. The pipeline is building. We've had some early on wins. We've got about 50 grants out there that we are highly confident of winning a large share of, and that's going to translate into business. And we see that, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starting to accelerate in 2023. And so it really hasn't been a material impact on our business to date and we all know that that's coming because of the commitment of the U.S. Government around that IIJA. So, those are reasons for optimism as we get into both top line and margin improvement as we enter 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning guys.\nSteve Demetriou: Hi Chad.\nChad Dillard: So, on the back of the announcement the 2022 Inflation Reduction Bill, particularly the climate change portion, can you give a little bit of color on that and just like how much would be addressable to Jacobs?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, it's the, very similar to the IIJA when you look at the climate change portion, which is in the high $300 billion, I think it's somewhere in the $370 billion $380 billion. We see somewhere in the 85% plus coverage by Jacobs of when you break that bill down to what we're able to see so far. And we haven't been able to get a 100% of it, but based on some of the specifics and what we're hearing, it's going to be a majority of it that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be an opportunity for Jacobs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Whitman from Baird. Your line is open.\nAndrew Whitman: Yes, great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. I guess just a clarification. I think Kevin, in your remarks, you made a comment, there was an FX benefit in your corporate unallocated. Is that the $8 million? And was that like, did you sell a swap or a currency hedge there to realize that? I'm just curious if that was cash or noncash as well?\nKevin Berryman: No this is basically translation related efforts or impacts, I should say Andy. So effectively, if you think about the revenue and the gross margin, all of that is negatively impacted by the dollar strength as the foreign currencies get translated into lower revenue and gross margin. That's partially offset by the fact that our costs are also reduced in terms of our international operations. So it's really driven more by that. No effective kind of trend transaction was related to that.\nOperator:\nLouie:\nLouie DiPalma: Good afternoon, Steve, Bob, Kevin and Ken.\nSteve Demetriou: Hey Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: With the announcement of this earnings call from PA Consulting from headquarters in London, do you have any plans to acquire the remaining 40% of PA Consulting that you don't already own?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, we've talked about this in the past and continue to have the same view that we really love the model that we've set up for the investment in PA and think it not only is unique, but it's one of the reasons why we were able to get that and to get this investment across the finish line. And, yes, there could be a scenario where we incrementally grow our ownership, but right now over the long-term we think having the PA partners and employees have ownership and the collaborative opportunities that that gives us is really part of, is really a key reason why we're off to such a strong start in the first year plus. And so we see that kind of model continuing going forward.\nOperator:\nMichael Feniger:\nMichael Feniger: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I realize you added in some areas investing in people, adding resources for the stronger growth outlook. You're talking about CMS, how some of these cyber contracts, which are higher margin are going to pick up next year. Just based on what you're saying and the expected pickup in funding, should we be seeing an outsized level of margin expansion in 2023 as utilization levels are likely to pick up?\nKevin Berryman: Hey, Michael, is this Kevin. Is your comment about CMS specifically?\nMichael Feniger: It's about overall the mix of the business?\nKevin Berryman: Well look, if we look at our margin profile just in Q3 and Q4, we do believe there's going to be an ability to increase margins as we come out of this dynamic that we're facing in Q3, Q4, where growth hasn't kicked in as much as we want or continuing to invest. So we do believe that there's margin upside in 2023 versus current level. But I wouldn't say extraordinary because we're going to ultimately continue to drive investments and support our business ability to grow longer term and at higher gross margins.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning or good afternoon. You know, as far as the Russian war with Ukraine and rising tensions in the Taiwanese Strait, could you just talk about, if you've seen any specific uptick in demand for Jacobs capabilities, space, cyber, is it -- you've seen international demand or mostly domestic? And then I guess a related question to the commercial side, what does the flow of European energy projects look like at this point?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, Josh, I I'd say two. Yes, the short answer is yes. We have seen an uptick in the client conversations and the -- and just the dialogue around potential opportunities. I'd break it down into two main parts and then to address your energy comment in Europe. For cyber services, yes these are predominantly U.S. based framework agreements that we have in place. And we've seen efforts around those agreements be applied to cyber intelligence activities, specifically surrounding what's going on in the Ukraine. And then the second part has been around defense infrastructure. And so you mentioned what's happening in the Taiwanese Straits, you probably say that our posture, well, when I say the Western hemisphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture around defense infrastructure in Asia has been going on for the better part of a decade. But now, in addition to that, we're seeing more requests. In fact, we've been awarded, they're confidential, a few jobs already in Eastern Europe around similar types of lay down platforms and defense infrastructure in Eastern Europe as a whole. On the second part around energy in Europe, the answer again is yes. Energy transition and in that effort, not just in continental Europe, but in the UK and in Europe and in Ireland as well is probably at an all-time high with regards to the activities and that continues to be a strong catalyst for growth for us in our European business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, thanks guys. I had a couple of quick questions. First on the CMS segment, you talked about the $10 billion of source selection bids out there, does that, is that net of the $4 billion NASA contract? And in general, what are you looking at for the September quarter? Were you looking for some fairly sizeable bookings? And if you could also refresh us on the recompete dynamic over the next 12 months, how much of the CMS business is up for rebid?\nSteve Demetriou: Let me just start and Bob, you can pick up. So the insource election around the $10 billion is net. So the -- I just want to be clear that the Johnson win is not in our backlog in the third quarter and will be added to the backlog in the fourth quarter. But what we're talking about now moving into the fourth quarter with our bid process is, I already covered several billion of that, being around the cyber and intelligence business, and also some opportunities specifically in our  segment working with the U.S. government. And so we're talking about net around all that. Bob, anything to add?\nBob Pragada: No, and may be probably the biggest recompete is NASA Kennedy that is coming up later in the year. We're currently under an extension there. So we like our -- we're confident about our opportunities in both Q4 and Q1.\nSteve Demetriou: Let me just clarify that. The $10 billion is new business, not rebid so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new awards.\nKevin Berryman: New awards insource collection and it's net of NASA, yes.\nOperator:\nKeyBanc:\nSean Eastman: Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to the investments being made this year. You know, I think it's been clear all through this year that this is somewhat of a major investment year for Jacobs, and it sounded like actually ramped up in the third quarter with sort of incremental investments offsetting that that gain on sale. I just wondered how much of that ramp is Jacobs really getting more aggressive and really bolstering that personnel to support growth versus it ending up costing more than you thought at the start of the year to build up that personnel to support growth? I hope that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fair question.\nKevin Berryman: Let me characterize our investment profile. Certainly we entered the year with, as we've talked about over the course of the fiscal year, some pretty strong investment profiles associated with the expected growth. We've actually reduced that a tad in Q3 and Q4 as we've seen a delay in some of the revenue build that we had envisioned happening faster and sooner in the second half of 2022. Now this one particular investment partially offset the WatchGuard benefit. But I think we've continued to be very proactive in sort of supporting people. I know that PA has invested in terms of salary improvements and have increased the pricing associated with efforts in that regard. So effectively, I think it's been broad based that we've continued to be investing against our people and supporting our people, but actually probably faster and in the first half versus the second half, other than this incremental investment we just made because of the WatchGuard benefit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nSteve Demetriou: Hey Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Can you give a little more color into the PA Consulting margin? I know you talked about it being pressured by FX and the incremental investments. Can you quantify those investments possibly? And I know you mentioned margins, you returned over 20% in the short term, but you still have confidence in your longer term margin expectations for PA, that sort of 23% flattish as you go ahead over the next several years?\nKevin Berryman: Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a crack at it and then we have Ken here with us and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it to him to see if he has any additional color. But the PA team has been very aggressive in getting new talent into the organization, both at an executive level and at a partner level, which ultimately helps drive and support incremental growth going long-term. They were very successful, especially in Q3 in bringing on board a bevy of talent, which is going to be positioning them for really strong growth going forward in 2023. That all came together, and fundamentally when they brought those folks on board, they're not obviously originally billable from day one and so that will put some pressure on their gross margin. Now it's just about adjusting their hiring going forward, determining how much they need and they'll start to see an improvement back up to the operating profit margin that we discussed in prepared remarks over 20% in the fourth quarter and ultimately beyond into 2023 and beyond and we feel confident on that. Ken?\nKen Toombs: Yes, I think you hit it, Kevin. Two things, one was significant amount of senior executive hiring, which came together all at the same time. So we actually had five senior executives join in the same quarter, which had significant cost with it. And then the second part was given the large deals that we have in the pipeline that we historically have not had, we started to ramp up hiring in advance to ensure we can actually service those should we win one or more of them. So we're very confident about the profile going forward and we've obviously watched our recruiting go forward that the pipeline remains very active and strong and we're confident.\nOperator:\nRBC Capital Markets.:\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks and good morning. Just kind of the first question is the 50 grants that I think Steve called out earlier related to the IIJA. Anyway you could quantify sort of the dollar amount or how much of that money has sort of come through already? And then just the second question is, maybe a bit more philosophical, but as you mentioned earlier, you are seeing not really any meaningful slowdown in the outlook, but -- and in the past downturns, government's really stepped up with spending across some of your end markets and regions. In the conversations you're having and how much those governments have spent over the last couple of years, what do you think the propensity is there to step up if there is any meaningful slowdown as you look over the next one, two, three years? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Yes, let me start, Steve here, let me start with it and then I'll turn it over to Bob, but first of all, congratulations. We understand you just had a new baby and wish you success on that big opportunity with your family. So on the grant side, I mentioned 50, there's -- we really, right now we, just some small fees associated with that, but the big opportunity is that we see the first 12 coming to fruition as far as a go decision over the next few weeks, and then those will start to ramp up and there's other grants on the back of that. So we have yet to see the benefit of those, and we're pretty excited about what those will lead to as the procurement cycle progresses on those. Bob why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you handle this?\nBob Pragada: Yes. And may be just a add on to that, which would then lead into those growth trajectories that we highlighted in our strategy, which we're gaining more confidence around that specifically in our infrastructure business, in our three major markets which actually four if you count the Middle East, but in the U.S., UK and Australia. On the government's historical reaction to recessionary type periods and then how does that compare to what's happening right now? We actually see that step up as being positive again. We're seeing governments pretty bullish on infrastructure spin, and then in areas where that might be a little bit in debate, those political candidates that seem to have some traction in the marketplace are making very vocal comments about putting more money into major programs in those geographies. So, all-in-all we're feeling very positive about what the future looks like in infrastructure.\nKevin Berryman: You also asked about the percent of money that's out there. I think it's over 30% now on the IIJA. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly what the number is right now, but it's over 30%.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Demetriou, I turn the call back over to you for some closing comments.\nSteve Demetriou: I just want to thank everyone for calling in and we look forward to updating you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. I'm going to Slide 10 for a financial overview of third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 7% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Pro forma for acquired revenue, net revenue also grew 7% year-over-year, which is an acceleration in growth from the second quarter. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly 400 basis points. And given current foreign exchange spot rates, we expect FX to impact our Q4 revenue by nearly 450 basis points on a year-over-year basis. On a reported basis for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, which translates into double digit growth on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, down 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by our CMS line of business related to newly ramping remediation contracts and the timing of the ramp on higher margin federal contracts, and the investment in incremental resources in PA in advance of expected growth. First point relative to client, look we're really not sensing any significant commentary from clients which are indicating concerns on the impact to their business associated with their investment profile. And look, if you look at the, I'm going to call it the private parts of the portfolio, specifically the life sciences and semiconductors, those clients are really continuing to be quite robust in their outlook. Good morning, Bert. Yes, Jerry couple of points. First is on the win profile associated with our CMS business, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been ramping some of the big environmental contracts, the nuclear remediation contracts, which are embedded into our forecast, which as you know, is lower margin. And we've previously discussed that the balance of the year would start to see an uptick in margins because of all of the shorter cycle and cyber and intelligence wins, which are coming. And actually Bob announced that one was, we just heard about this this week actually, and so, or last week and so look at the end of the day, all of those are happening. They're just not happening and won't ramp in Q4 which was our original expectation. So if you look at that dynamic, that puts a little bit of pressure on the Q4 margin that we have in addition to continue to have the investment profile and we're not backing off of that in Q4 because of the anticipation of the growth in 2023 and beyond. So it's a double kind of double impact on Q4, but ultimately then translates into 2023 starting to rebound and come back into the margin profile that we've seen in the past. Now it's going to take a while to get there, but ultimately we're confident that the margin profile will start to kick back up in 2023. No this is basically translation related efforts or impacts, I should say Andy. So effectively, if you think about the revenue and the gross margin, all of that is negatively impacted by the dollar strength as the foreign currencies get translated into lower revenue and gross margin. That's partially offset by the fact that our costs are also reduced in terms of our international operations. So it's really driven more by that. No effective kind of trend transaction was related to that. Hey, Michael, is this Kevin. Is your comment about CMS specifically? Well look, if we look at our margin profile just in Q3 and Q4, we do believe there's going to be an ability to increase margins as we come out of this dynamic that we're facing in Q3, Q4, where growth hasn't kicked in as much as we want or continuing to invest. So we do believe that there's margin upside in 2023 versus current level. But I wouldn't say extraordinary because we're going to ultimately continue to drive investments and support our business ability to grow longer term and at higher gross margins. New awards insource collection and it's net of NASA, yes. Let me characterize our investment profile. Certainly we entered the year with, as we've talked about over the course of the fiscal year, some pretty strong investment profiles associated with the expected growth. We've actually reduced that a tad in Q3 and Q4 as we've seen a delay in some of the revenue build that we had envisioned happening faster and sooner in the second half of 2022. Now this one particular investment partially offset the WatchGuard benefit. But I think we've continued to be very proactive in sort of supporting people. I know that PA has invested in terms of salary improvements and have increased the pricing associated with efforts in that regard. So effectively, I think it's been broad based that we've continued to be investing against our people and supporting our people, but actually probably faster and in the first half versus the second half, other than this incremental investment we just made because of the WatchGuard benefit. Yes, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll take a crack at it and then we have Ken here with us and Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn it to him to see if he has any additional color. But the PA team has been very aggressive in getting new talent into the organization, both at an executive level and at a partner level, which ultimately helps drive and support incremental growth going long-term.

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued its strong performance in the third quarter with total backlog increasing 7% on a reported basis and reported on a pro forma basis to $10.2 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient, recurring revenue growth and market expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Our service and solution offering are delivered across our core customers markets, space, national security, cyber intelligence, and energy environment and we are leveraging our growth accelerators of data solutions, climate response in Consulting and Advisory to catalyze the business. We have substantial revenue visibility as approximately 85% of CMSa\u0302\u0080\u0099 portfolio consists of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than four years and 88% from federal level government funding. Although economic and geopolitical uncertainties continue, our strong Q3 ending backlog gives us confidence in our next 12 months forecast of revenue. Three market trends that we see contributing to our continued growth include space debris management, robotics, and 5G network build out. Beginning with space debris management, decades of space travelers resulted in large amounts of space debris damage to the satellites and future launches, adding to the cost of operating satellites and other space platforms like the International Space Station or ISS. If debris destroys a satellite, it can take months and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to restore its service. We support the orbital debris tracking program at NASA and provide plume analysis and communication systems, simulation for vehicles visiting the ISS. In addition, we provide media tracking data for multiple government agencies. Space debris tracking is one of many services Jacobs provides on the recently awarded Johnson Engineering, Technology and Science or JETS II contract with builds on Jacobs more than 17 years of continuous support at Johnson Space Center. Under this contract, we will provide multidisciplinary technical services to support the future of human space exploration, as well as help NASA incubate the emerging commercial space economy. This 10-year $3.9 billion win will book in Q4 and represents a $1.8 billion increase to our existing contract. This serves to illustrate the continuing strong, massive Jacobs partnership. Moving on to robotics. We are increasingly delivering valued solutions to our clients by utilizing robots that reduce costs and increase accuracy and safety in otherwise manual human processes. And we're excited to announce the last quarter we integrated the Resolve robotics team in the UK into CMS, who brings software expertise and IP to help accelerate our growth. Our existing CMS robotics team already delivers groundbreaking innovations, developing and deploying robotics systems in challenging environments such as the robotic tool to retrieve sand like debris from inside a damaged nuclear reactor at Fukushima in Japan, autonomous systems to map riverbeds for the British army, and designing robotic systems for ITER, the world's largest fusion power experiment. Finally demand for 5G telecommunications. Our telecom group provides full solutions for the deployment of next generation wireless and wireline networks for leading telecommunication companies like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as Fortune 1000 healthcare and commercial companies looking to build their own 5G networks. We also support the infrastructure market providing 5G integration, network optimization, and technical services alongside our PMPs teams to accelerate growth. While rollout of 5G infrastructure deployment is still in its early ramp phase, we continue to see increased demand for both integrated 4G and 5G solutions from our commercial telco infrastructure, healthcare and government clients. During the quarter, our telecom group added several new awards, total more than $150 million to deliver projects advancing 5G nationwide. We are excited for the team's recent successes and are well positioned for growth as adoption of 5G use cases and penetration growth. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our CMS solutions. Last week, we were notified that we were awarded a $470 million, six-year cyber and intelligence related task order, which we expect to benefit and begin ramping at the end of this current quarter. The sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business pipeline at approximately $25 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Turning to Slide 8, during the quarter, People & Places Solutions delivered record setting, quarterly bookings that topped pre-pandemic levels. We also enjoyed year-over-year bookings growth of 11% and backlog growth of 13%, delivering a high mark for operating profit in the quarter. Despite macroeconomic concerns, we performed well due to the balance of public and private sector clients with a multinational focus, resulting in continued high percentage of revenue already booked in backlog. As I talk about the quarter, I'll address our four ongoing themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization, climate response, and data solutions. Starting with supply chain diversification. With continued breakthroughs in biotechnology, strong customer demand and robust operating cash flow, life sciences clients are investing in manufacturing expansion and contract operations capacity globally. As a leader in the market, tier one clients have confidence in Jacobs ability to deliver highly complex Greenfield and expansion projects at speed that provides time to market for our clients, that maximizes their competitive advantage in new therapeutics. Growing health service needs are leading to innovative approaches to care. We are optimizing facilities for clients, such as the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, where we serve as their project delivery partner. We are improving sustainability access and energy efficiency for NHS Scotland, as well as increasing much needed access to critical mental healthcare in Australia. We continue to see robust demand for semiconductor chips, data center capacity expansion, and growth in the electric vehicle market and have secured recent confidential wins in all three categories. On top of strong secular demand for semiconductors, we are pleased to see the passing of the $53 billion U.S. CHIPS Bill, which will incentivize investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and specialized tools. Infrastructure modernization. Increased client investments in mega and giga scale infrastructure continues, and with our number one ENR ranking in program management, our delivery reputation has been a key differentiator in staying ahead of our client's needs in a dynamic global environment. We recently have been awarded several strategic full lifecycle programs for new transformative scale cities in the Middle East that will address social, economic and climate priorities, and we'll have flexible and long-term contracting vehicles. With a renewed interest in equitable, sustainable transportation, we are experiencing a significant investment in the transit and rail sector with wins across the globe, such as Irish Rail, British Railways, multiple clients in Australia and resilient transit planning for Sacramento area Council of Governments here in the U.S. The infrastructure investment in JOBS Act is resulting in a steady increase in new project awards to modernize and increase the resiliency of U.S. infrastructure. For example, we won a major water supply resilience program for Eastern New Mexico Water Utility Authority, a five-year storm water implementation program for the City of Baton Rouge, and a funding strategy with Oklahoma DoT. Additionally, our IIJA advisory team is positioning our clients to win funding opportunities with over 50 differentiated grant applications across transportation, water, and energy. We anticipate additional awards in the coming quarters as the opportunities in our sales pipeline move into the next phase of procurement. Moving to Climate Response. We see our clients continuing to invest in clean energy across all sectors with primary spend related to grid modernization, cost effective renewable energy generation and EV Charging Infrastructure or EVCI. Our progress in these areas is demonstrated globally. In Asia through advisory and policy consulting for the Asia Development Bank, in Canada with a pipeline utility program, in Australia through transmission and distribution design projects with AusNet Services, and in the U.S. via New Consulting and Advisory framework to advance energy transition with a leading provider. Transportation electrification and advanced charging infrastructure plans have topped our clientsa\u0302\u0080\u0099 agendas across all regions for aviation, ports, highways and rail and transit. This includes projects for Heathrow Airport in the UK to implement landside EBCI, Ohio DoT Statewide EV Infrastructure program, and a major U.S. Transportation Authority transitioning operations to zero emissions for one of the world's largest bus fleets by 2040. Collectively, this is a very exciting space for us and aligns strongly with our climate response accelerator. Moving to Data Solutions. We are using advanced data analytics to optimize our clientsa\u0302\u0080\u0099 decision making as well as their ability to de-risk long-term investments. For example, in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board, our StreetLight Data team is using advanced analytics to better measure and manage transportation emissions. We are also continuing our technology consulting support for a U.S. State DoT with integrated corridor management, connected automated transportation systems, and other advanced mobility solutions to maximize use of their existing transportation infrastructure. In the water market we are awarded a contract with the Water Research Foundation to develop the first full scale deployment of machine learning, predictive control for wastewater systems, a new technology to advance the global water industry. Our Cyber and Digital Services teams were awarded projects in support of the Operational Technology Resiliency plan for a major UK utility network operator. And in Australia, we have secured the Digital and Data Advisory Services scope to support advanced analytics across Brisbane City Council's entire asset lifecycle. In summary, our strong sales pipeline is supported by well-funded government budgets to modernize their infrastructure and commercial clients that are addressing secular growth opportunities. The agility of our global workforce, combined with elevated spend on transformative, complex infrastructure, uniquely positions us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Given these dynamics and the visibility of our revenue in backlog, we are excited in the growth trajectory for our People and Places business, both now and into the future. Yes. Bert on the first part on the CHIPS Bill, I think the way that we're thinking about it is, is that, that was already such a robust business for us based on the clientele that we have and what the business drivers were for them. But the CHIPS Bill did go as quick, even more credibility as well as substantiation of continued growth for those clients that are actually changing their business model. So I think it's putting more confidence that the cycle that we used to talk about being traditional 18 to 36 months cycles going even further with now support from the Federal Government, so we're, we're excited about that. With regards to the volatility in PA's business, you know, its a\u0302\u0080\u0093 PA is very unique model. It's structured where the traditional management consultant relying on discretionary spend of their clients for business transformation activities is not really where PA sits. PA sits in product innovation and in using that product innovation to transform businesses and so these are really at the core of the clients that they serve. So we're not really seeing -- we're not seeing that as evidenced by the bookings trends that we saw with PA this quarter being at the highest that they've been eventually ever which is really putting some credibility in the backlog moving forward. No, and may be probably the biggest recompete is NASA Kennedy that is coming up later in the year. We're currently under an extension there. So we like our -- we're confident about our opportunities in both Q4 and Q1. Yes. And may be just a add on to that, which would then lead into those growth trajectories that we highlighted in our strategy, which we're gaining more confidence around that specifically in our infrastructure business, in our three major markets which actually four if you count the Middle East, but in the U.S., UK and Australia. On the government's historical reaction to recessionary type periods and then how does that compare to what's happening right now? We actually see that step up as being positive again. We're seeing governments pretty bullish on infrastructure spin, and then in areas where that might be a little bit in debate, those political candidates that seem to have some traction in the marketplace are making very vocal comments about putting more money into major programs in those geographies. So, all-in-all we're feeling very positive about what the future looks like in infrastructure."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "All right, thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our near term outlook. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re excited to be conducting todaya\u0302\u0080\u0099s call on PA Consulting offices in London and Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll provide more color in just a moment on our strong early on success of our investment in PA. But first turning to Slide 4, at Jacobs the combination of a proactive approach to strategic portfolio management and driving a high performance culture has created a touch quality business with substantial recurring revenue thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s resilient during a variety of macroeconomic conditions. This is complemented by our focus on secular growth in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions. Our competitive advantage is based on strength staying true to our values. We harness a deep technical expertise to reinvent the way we solve problems and chase the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients. As I shift to the quarterly results, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re clearly seeing strong underlying trends in accelerated growth at Jacobs. From the velocity of our sales pipeline, our recent major wins that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll talk about today and next quarter, to increasing trends in utilization, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re positioned for strong profitable growth going forward. During the quarter net revenue grew 8% year-over-year and double digits on a constant currency basis, with growth across each line of business. More importantly, bookings were strong across the company, resulting in revenue backlog up 10% year-over-year and actually up 13% in constant currency. We saw continued strong performance in our Advanced Facilities business as demonstrated by our 25% year-over-year top line growth and an acceleration in P&PS  bookings during the quarter within our Americas business, driven by awards related to the U.S. infrastructure modernization. Within Critical Mission Solutions, we were awarded a strategic $3.9 billion NASA Johnson 10-year rebate significantly larger than our existing contract and which will be added to our backlog in the fourth quarter. This is one of many long-term recurrent contracts that provide revenue visibility for the business. On a constant currency basis, PA Consulting continued to show strong growth with revenue up 22% and backlog up 19% year-over-year. The strong visibility of our diverse business with upside from secular growth trends combined with robust cash flow generation affords us the ability to generate returns for our shareholders in times of economic uncertainty. Now turning to Slide 5. This time two years ago in the height of the pandemic we were zeroing in on the PA Consulting transaction, and PA  is significantly exceeding our financial expectations and revenue synergies are accelerating. Results are strong across all PAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s peak performance indicators. In Culture and Talent the number of partners has increased more than 20% since the transaction closed, with additional key hires across operations, research, technology and sales, further strengthening PAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s capabilities in client solutions. And very exciting is their women and leadership program with the current PA leadership team now at 50% female. Financial performance continues strong with the weighted pipeline up more than 40% compared to the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date revenues are up 20% in constant currency with an operating margin of 21%, which is an indicator of PAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s high quality business. On the Operations and Strategy front, PA is seeing success following the launch of it IP monetization, and they are gaining momentum in the U.S. with new leadership and an expanding portfolio. And in the area of revenue synergies we have posted 18 joint wins since the beginning of the partnership and are seeing significant collaborative opportunities in multiple markets, including health and life sciences, energy and utilities, and consumer products. Our partnership with PA has been one of the most successful in value creating investments and our Consulting and Advisory accelerator is a clear priority for future capital deployment. Turning to Slide 6. A key to our successful partnership has been the close alignment of our purpose around creating solutions that have positive social impact, whether it's working together to improve healthcare for families through leading edge cell and gene therapy, addressing patient safety and emergency departments across the U.S., solving issues of connectivity and decarbonization for global rail market, delivering resilient solutions in the areas of deforestation and fire prevention in the UK, and the undergrounding of 10,000 miles of cable for PG&E to mitigate forest fires in California, and on the clean energy front, collaborating on analyzing investments for private equity and green hydrogen. Once again, looking ahead, we believe our partnership with TA is critical to delivering our new Jacobs strategy. Now I'll turn it over to Bob Pragada to discuss our line of businesses. All right, thank you, Kevin. As Kevin described we have a diverse portfolio with significant reimbursable recurring revenue, and it provides us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios, and manage the impacts of inflationary pressures on our business. With this diversity comes some exposure to foreign currency translation as we have approximately 34% of our revenue outside of the U.S. with 21% of that revenue in UK Pound Sterling. As a result of the latest foreign exchange dynamics, we're providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter of adjusted EBITDA in the range of $340 million to $360 million and an adjusted EPS of $1.75 to $1.85 with the midpoints tied to the current FX rates. We feel very confident in our underlying business trends in the fourth quarter, and it provided the lower end of the range to reflect the possibility of any FX erosion. It is important to note that relative to our fiscal 2022 forecast back in November, foreign currency translation has impacted our full year expected fiscal 2022 net revenue outlook by approximately $320 million, adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million and adjusted EPS by nearly $0.20 to ensure our change in annual guidance and EPS is effectively driven by currency volatility versus our original expectations. In closing, we are excited about the momentum across all of our business as demonstrated by our accelerating revenue growth, our strong bookings and backlog, and a robust sales pipeline globally. Operator, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll now open the call for questions. The only thing Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d adda\u0302\u0080\u00a6Go ahead operator. Good morning. Yes, so Steve here. Yes, the good news is we actually had two wins in the last 30 days in the cyber intelligence business. There was a $500 million one that did get booked late in the third quarter, and then we've had one just in the last week that Kevin just talked about thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s just under $500 million. And those are two good sized cyber intelligence awards with better margins than some of our longer term enterprise contracts that we have in CMS. So they're going be margin are creative and we're really going to see those playing out as early as, you know, as far as the P&L in the first quarter of 2023. So, and then on top of that, we have about $1.5 billion of things that could hit sometime in the fourth quarter, as far as pursuits out there, and if you look at our normal win rate, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to add on top of that. And then on the back of that, there's a series of other pursuit opportunities that will play out sometime in the first half of 2023. So we're, you know, we are excited about cyber intelligence, a little frustrated that it's taken a few quarters longer than we had expected. And then I just want to add on the back of that outside of cyber intelligence, which also gives us some optimism is that the Americas IIJA initiatives, we are clearly seeing momentum now in that. The pipeline is building. We've had some early on wins. We've got about 50 grants out there that we are highly confident of winning a large share of, and that's going to translate into business. And we see that, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s starting to accelerate in 2023. And so it really hasn't been a material impact on our business to date and we all know that that's coming because of the commitment of the U.S. Government around that IIJA. So, those are reasons for optimism as we get into both top line and margin improvement as we enter 2023. Hi Chad. Yes, it's the, very similar to the IIJA when you look at the climate change portion, which is in the high $300 billion, I think it's somewhere in the $370 billion $380 billion. We see somewhere in the 85% plus coverage by Jacobs of when you break that bill down to what we're able to see so far. And we haven't been able to get a 100% of it, but based on some of the specifics and what we're hearing, it's going to be a majority of it thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to be an opportunity for Jacobs. Hey Louie. Yes, we've talked about this in the past and continue to have the same view that we really love the model that we've set up for the investment in PA and think it not only is unique, but it's one of the reasons why we were able to get that and to get this investment across the finish line. And, yes, there could be a scenario where we incrementally grow our ownership, but right now over the long-term we think having the PA partners and employees have ownership and the collaborative opportunities that that gives us is really part of, is really a key reason why we're off to such a strong start in the first year plus. And so we see that kind of model continuing going forward. Yes, Josh, I I'd say two. Yes, the short answer is yes. We have seen an uptick in the client conversations and the -- and just the dialogue around potential opportunities. I'd break it down into two main parts and then to address your energy comment in Europe. For cyber services, yes these are predominantly U.S. based framework agreements that we have in place. And we've seen efforts around those agreements be applied to cyber intelligence activities, specifically surrounding what's going on in the Ukraine. And then the second part has been around defense infrastructure. And so you mentioned what's happening in the Taiwanese Straits, you probably say that our posture, well, when I say the Western hemispherea\u0302\u0080\u0099s posture around defense infrastructure in Asia has been going on for the better part of a decade. But now, in addition to that, we're seeing more requests. In fact, we've been awarded, they're confidential, a few jobs already in Eastern Europe around similar types of lay down platforms and defense infrastructure in Eastern Europe as a whole. On the second part around energy in Europe, the answer again is yes. Energy transition and in that effort, not just in continental Europe, but in the UK and in Europe and in Ireland as well is probably at an all-time high with regards to the activities and that continues to be a strong catalyst for growth for us in our European business. Let me just start and Bob, you can pick up. So the insource election around the $10 billion is net. So the -- I just want to be clear that the Johnson win is not in our backlog in the third quarter and will be added to the backlog in the fourth quarter. But what we're talking about now moving into the fourth quarter with our bid process is, I already covered several billion of that, being around the cyber and intelligence business, and also some opportunities specifically in our  segment working with the U.S. government. And so we're talking about net around all that. Bob, anything to add? Let me just clarify that. The $10 billion is new business, not rebid so ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s new awards. Hey Andy. Yes, let me start, Steve here, let me start with it and then I'll turn it over to Bob, but first of all, congratulations. We understand you just had a new baby and wish you success on that big opportunity with your family. So on the grant side, I mentioned 50, there's -- we really, right now we, just some small fees associated with that, but the big opportunity is that we see the first 12 coming to fruition as far as a go decision over the next few weeks, and then those will start to ramp up and there's other grants on the back of that. So we have yet to see the benefit of those, and we're pretty excited about what those will lead to as the procurement cycle progresses on those. Bob why dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t you handle this? I just want to thank everyone for calling in and we look forward to updating you next quarter."

Throughout the presentation and in the appendix of this presentation, we provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I\u2019ll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you, John. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and an update on our newly launched strategy. In March, we shared the details of our new strategy boldly moving forward, which unleashes a culture of inclusion, innovation and inspiration across Jacobs, enabling us to execute against one of the most exciting periods in our company\u2019s history. Our excitement surrounding the new strategy is driven by multiple robust growth opportunities across all lines of business, with additional opportunities to accelerate our performance in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions. For those that are new to Jacobs, we are a professional services company that combines deep technical knowledge across a variety of scientific engineering and technology disciplines with cutting edge proprietary solutions. We serve a diverse set of sectors and global clients that are navigating the need to modernize their infrastructure and supply chains to protect national security, while embarking upon multiyear digital transformations across all facets of their operational environments. This dynamic creates a compelling opportunity for decades of growth for Jacobs. By staying true to our values and purpose, we are a company like no other, reinventing the way we solve problems and shaping the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients. During the quarter, net revenue grew 10% year-over-year with growth across each line of business. Bookings were strong across the company resulting in our revenue backlog up 9% year-over-year with an approving gross profit profile. We were awarded a record level of higher margin professional services and People & Places Solutions, including several strategic wins developing grants that will enable our clients to access funds from the U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act as well as an increasing number of larger opportunities entering our sales pipeline. Critical Mission Solutions benefited from the large space intelligence win, we disclosed last quarter, and PA Consulting had another outstanding quarter with 15% reported year-over-year revenue growth and 19% growth in constant currency, while delivering adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our Advanced Facilities business continues to achieve record year-over-year growth rates driven by wins in the semiconductor, life sciences, and electric vehicle sectors. Given our increased visibility and confidence for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook with no change to the midpoint. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to expect strong organic growth with healthy cash flow conversion that affords us the ability to deploy capital for enhanced value creation. Turning to Slide 5. As we outlined during our new strategy launch, we are a purpose-led company with deep domain knowledge and a track record of delivering solutions to combat the global climate crisis. With this sense of urgency top of mind, we have made significant achievements both internally and externally. With approximately $6 billion in revenue driven from ESG and climate-related solutions, we are playing a pivotal role in mitigating one of our generation\u2019s greatest threats. Working with our clients, we are co-creating solutions and energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation, resilience, natural resource, stewardship and ESG business transformation. Similarly, we have delivered on our corporate commitments through our significant emissions reductions and carbon neutrality status. And in April, we took another major step and launched our updated Climate Action Plan to align our net zero commitments with the new recognized international standard. Our ambitious commitments include ensuring every client project we undertake becomes a client response opportunity, achieving net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040 and maintaining carbon neutrality with 100% low carbon electricity for our operations. I\u2019m also proud to share that we are one of the world\u2019s first companies in the first consultancy organization to have validated net zero targets approved by our Science Based Targets Initiative. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued to strong backlog performance in the second quarter increasing 8% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. This strategy is underpinned by our focus on key capabilities tied to our growth accelerators, data and cyber solutions, Climate Response, and Consulting & Advisory across our core customer market of national security, space and energy. Three market trends that we are seeing offering continued strong growth this year and beyond include all-source intelligence, energy transition, and space exploration. Beginning with all-source intelligence, the increasing intelligence threat levels require analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial, and measurement and signature to allow for better real time decision making. All-source intelligence offerings are advancing to include specialized collection management, visualization, and dissemination as a service aligned to specific threats like drug trafficking, organized crime and threat finance. Jacobs\u2019 cyber and intelligence business has a full spectrum of all-source intelligence solution to guide our national security clients through these increasingly sophisticated digital threats. In the second quarter, Jacobs won the U.S. Army\u2019s intelligence operations support contract to provide comprehensive 24/7 all-source intelligence analysis to the Army\u2019s Joint Task Force, Combatant Commands, and Service Component Commands. Also, we were awarded a seat  on the DoDs and Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Data Readiness for AI development, which encompasses all tasks required to prepare, manage and secure dataset in DoD AI models and assist DevSecOps. Moving on to energy transition. Nuclear energy, along with renewables are critical components of the global energy portfolio to transition economies away from fossil fuels. There is now a growing recognition that to achieve net zero we must include the always on emission free generation that only nuclear power can provide. Every year, nuclear power averts  a gigaton of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 217 million cars. Power generated from nuclear provides stability and resilience to electrical grids, due to its unique ability to ensure 24/7 energy supply, regardless of weather conditions, and Jacobs is well positioned as a leader in delivering global nuclear solutions. We were recently awarded a contract by EDF Energy operator of the Sizewell B nuclear plant, located in Suffolk, UK, to support the extension of the station\u2019s operating life by 20 years to 2055. Another aspect of our nuclear science expertise is our strong remediation capabilities. Our environmental team has successfully faced in the Idaho cleanup project at the Idaho National Laboratory and won the Oak Ridge Reservation Contract to perform environmental remediation work for the Department of Energy in Eastern Tennessee. Finally, demand for space exploration. In past , Jacobs supported NASA and rolling out the fully integrated Space Launch System for the Artemis 1 mission with launch to occur this summer. Artemis 1 will be the first uncrewed flight mission in NASA\u2019s Deep Space Human Exploration Program. The Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025, including the first woman and first person of color. Also for NASA, we were recently awarded the NASA Ames test operations and maintenance contracts. The 5th consecutive victory for Jacobs on this contract, which we originally won in 1998, this 5-year $220 million win will book in Q3, but highlights the continuing and strong NASA-Jacobs partnership. This quarter, Jacobs was also awarded a contract from Australia\u2019s Department of Defense Space Command to support the implementation of new space capabilities in Deep Space Advanced Radar, Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance and Space Control. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our solutions in the second half of 2022 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 month qualified new business add more than $25 billion, including $15 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Now on to Slide 8 are discussed our People & Places Solutions business. Our strategy is being actualized in real time with strong quarter backlog performance at 9% growth, while building sales momentum across multiple markets and geographies, specifically, in our advanced manufacturing, health and life sciences and U.S. infrastructure markets. I will discuss the P&P results under the themes of supply chain diversification, climate response, data solutions, and infrastructure modernization. Starting with supply chain diversification, we continue to respond to increasing demand and supply chain realignment that secures supply for health and life sciences and semiconductor manufacturing. For example, we\u2019re seeing an expansion of both organic and contract manufacturing for life sciences capacity in the U.S., Ireland and Denmark. And in Singapore, we\u2019re bringing a world class team of clinical specialists and facility experts to reimagined sustainable patient-centered care models for expanded facilities at Alexandra Hospital. To address the global semiconductor shortage, Jacobs\u2019 leveraging global resources, expertise, and design automation to deliver critical capacity expansion for multiple semiconductor manufacturing clients in the U.S. and Europe. In a related industry, Jacobs is working with clients in all phases of the electric vehicle ecosystem, implementing state-of-the-art facilities that co-locate lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle production to improve system delays and resilience. Across geographies, alternative fuel planning continues to drive investment for transportation agencies with recent awards for Michigan and Nevada DoT to unlock U.S. Infrastructure Act Funding. Moving to Climate Response. Jacobs remains on the forefront of advising our clients on true carbon impacts in areas ranging from biodegradable materials with an award from NatureWorks to embodied carbon calculations with a recent study for a major data center client. We\u2019re seeing material pipeline growth in our climate response and energy transition portfolio, as evidenced by wins with national grid in the UK to deliver innovative clean energy transmission, a wind farm in Australia, large coastal resiliency programs in Louisiana, and an offshore wind project in the Northeastern United States to convert and underutilized port to support one of the largest most advanced offshore wind facilities in the country. In addition, our innovation investments in PFAS solutions have resulted in an award for its first-of-its-kind program to study nature-based remediation options at more than 35 airports across Australia. Moving to Data Solutions, our deep domain expertise combined with our digital platforms to bring world class technology-enabled solutions to our clients. Our recent acquisition StreetLight is working with Siemens and New York State to forecast impacts of renewables and EV charging infrastructure to plan strategic investment upgrade. In the UK, Jacobs and PA Consulting are transforming Hampshire  with multi-sector digitally enabled solutions to support economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. Additionally, we\u2019ve had an exciting new win for smart connected and secure infrastructure with national highways and confidential manufacturing clients. Now, discussing infrastructure modernization, faced with aging infrastructure and financial and social equity challenges, Jacobs is helping our clients to reimagine infrastructure. In Melbourne, our delivery excellence resulted in a renewed contract with Yarra Valley Water representing up to 18 years of partnership. In Los Angeles, we are expanding our legacy of being a trusted adviser to the Department of Water and Power by delivering a $17 billion master plan development for water reuse facilities. And for the Port of Alaska, we were recently awarded a contract extension to create a safer, more efficient and resilient port with coastal protection. This quarter, we saw significant growth in rail and transit with 2 clients awarding Jacobs their largest expansion ever. This includes an underground rail line in Singapore and New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority leveraging of the U.S. Infrastructure Act to strengthen the regional rail system and equitably bridge communities. We also expanded our portfolio in Continental Europe in partnership with NIRAS with two 8-year framework agreements for the Copenhagen Metro and the Greater Copenhagen Light Rail. Overall, we\u2019re seeing double-digit pipeline growth that is strengthening due to global infrastructure stimulus across transportation, water, energy and environment, as well as advanced manufacturing. Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 8, as Steve mentioned, PA had another impressive quarter. Their unique digital consultancy services enables clients to accelerate new growth ideas from concept through to commercial success. This allows PA to capitalize quickly and efficiently on global trends and growth markets such as climate response, and health and life sciences. Specifically in the health market, PA continues to use it skills as a force for good, and it\u2019s currently advising the American College of Emergency Physicians on how to build and operate a first-of-its-kind national registry. This next generation digital platform will transform healthcare for the nation\u2019s infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Focusing on climate response, there are 2 examples which demonstrate the breadth of PAs capabilities. The first is for the UK government where PA provided consultancy services for a launch of a new infrastructure fund to drive the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country. Secondly, PA and the Swedish R&D and IP company PulPac continue to accelerate their exclusive global development partnership for the revolutionary patented technology. PulPac uses renewable pulp and cellulose to produce fiber-based packaging and single use products as an alternative to plastics creating up to 80% lower CO2 footprint. The partnership recorded 3 strategic confidential win this quarter and have developed a solid go-to market plan to the United States. It is evident from all these examples that PA continues to be a crucial part of our strategy with their alignment to Jacobs\u2019 3 growth accelerators. I had the privilege of joining the 1-year PA Consulting and Jacobs\u2019 celebratory road show last month, attending sessions at 6 different PA offices in 4 different countries. PA CEO, Ken Toombs, and I met over 1,300 PA employees with extremely positive feedback. We continue to build on collective success during our first year, and I look forward to continued collaborative successes for our clients and the world. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob, and good day to all that are joining us on the call today. Like to turn to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter fiscal 2022 results. Second quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year, although net revenue grew 10% and was up 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points, and given current spot FX rates, we expect FX pressure to continue for the remainder of the year. Exiting Q2, we fully lapped the impact from the lower margin CMS procurement contract and the timing difference between our 2 large environmental remediation contracts. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect total net revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26.6%, up 80 basis points driven by improvement in People & Places and PAs improved mix impact, partially offset by the revenue ramp from the large new environmental remediation project win in CMS. Looking past 2022, as we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix. We expect our gross margins to continue to expand. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 16.5% down slightly from our first quarter. Within G&A, we are making investments to prepare for the increase in opportunities from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure stimulus, as well as other investments to improve the efficiency of businesses, who are focused 2023 initiative. We expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to trend lower for the remainder of the fiscal year. GAAP operating profit was $166 million and was mainly impacted by $99 million charge associated with the Legacy CH2M Matter we disclosed in April and other related legal costs. Also included in GAAP operating profit was $48 million of amortization costs from acquired intangibles. Other acquisition deal costs and restructuring efforts were $18 million, with around half related to acquisition related costs. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 7% year-over-year, and down slightly on a pro forma basis. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.1%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.68 per share, and included the $0.63 charge related to the settlement of the previously mentioned Legacy CH2M Matter and related legal costs. A $0.25 impact related to our amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.09 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower and a $0.07 impact from a higher tax rate in the quarter versus our expected rate for the full year. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.72. Jacobs consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $340 million, and was up nearly 3% year-over-year and represented 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, the revenue book-to-bill ratio was just under 1.94 times, but was 1.12 on a gross profit basis, as we saw a continued increase in profitability in our backlog. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS Q2 revenue was up 4% year-over-year and up 3% on our pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by nearly 100 basis points. During the quarter, CMS revenue growth left the impact from the contract run off of a lower margin large procurement contract and benefited from the timing of our large DOE environmental remediation win at Idaho. As a result, we expect CMS revenue to show double-digit second half 2022 revenue growth driven by strong performance in space intelligence from our recent large new award continued increase from the large environmental contracts to its expected full run rate. Accelerating performance in our telecom business driven by a strategic relationships with 5G providers and Cyber and Intel awards delayed during the continuing resolution beginning to ramp. Q2 CMS operating profit was $113 million, down 1%. Operating profit margin was down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%. As expected, operating margins were impacted by the ramp up of our large environmental remediation win and the delay of the higher margin shorter cycle awards that were pushed to the right do the continuing resolution. We expect operating profit margin to trend slightly above Q2 levels for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Moving to People & Places, Q2 net revenue was up 2.8% year-over-year and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from foreign exchange. Our advanced facilities business net revenue growth, again, was up double-digits year-over-year, driven by investments in the semiconductor and pharma supply chains. We expect continued robust growth from advanced facilities throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong Q2 year-over-year growth, despite the impact from currency determined by more steady government funding. For the second half of fiscal 2022, we expect net revenue growth from our international business to moderate with pressure from the unfavorable impact of FX. Moving to People & Places Americas, net revenue growth in Q2 improved from Q1 driven by front end work related to the infrastructure stimulus. We\u2019re seeing the benefit from the budget resolution and meaningful build in our 12 to 18 months pipeline from the infrastructure stimulus projects. Our second quarter gross margin bookings and pipeline provides us confidence in sequential gross profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 versus the first half. Total P&PS Q2 gross profit grew year-over-year, but Q2 operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by increased G&A expenses as we continued to spend, again, strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PAs performance, PA contributed $297 million in revenue, and $68 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q2 revenue grew 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 19% in constant currency. Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 23%. As a quick reminder, PA grew revenue and constant currency 24% year-over-year for fiscal year 2021 and delivered a 23% operating profit margin, thus making year-to-date revenue and margin performance even more impressive. Our non-allocated corporate expenses were $41 million, up year-over-year and within our expectations as medical costs moderated. We now expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be at the lower end of our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid cash flow generation with $96 million from reported free cash flow, which was in line with our expectations given the timing of PA employee tax-related costs associated with their annual bonus payments, and the net working capital impact of discrete items which effectively offset each other. DSOs ticked up modestly year-over-year driven by the timing of new CMS wins and the ramp of the large environment Idaho win in our CMS line of business. The quarter\u2019s cash flow included a net $40 million cash benefit related to monetizing an Australian dollar FX had related to the CH2M legal matters settlement partially offset by cash restructuring. To date since March, we have repurchased approximately $135 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistically repurchase our shares. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be affected by the gross cash settlement of the CH2M related legal matter of $480 million, with nearly $100 million in cash tax benefits, partially offsetting that amount over the next few quarters. Adjusting for the impact of the legal sub settlement, other restructuring items, we remain on track toward achieving our onetime free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income target and expect similar or better free cash flow conversion going forward. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.2 billion resulting in $2 billion of net debt. Pro forma for the legal settlement, and including our estimated second half cash flow, we expect Q4 net debt to adjusted 2022 EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which we recently announced. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve for Slide 14.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you, Kevin. Our diverse portfolio has proven resilient, providing us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios with an asset-light business model and the ability to manage pricing during an inflationary environment. Given our increased visibility and competence for fiscal 2022, we are tightening our outlook and maintaining the midpoint guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.385 billion to $1.435 billion from the $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion previous guidance. And our adjusted EPS outlook is now in the range of $6.95 to $7.35 from $6.85 to $7.45, previously. Looking past fiscal 2022, our backlog performance and increasing sales pipeline provides us with the continued conviction in achieving the multi-year financial growth targets we provided during our March strategy launch. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Adam on for Jerry today. Good morning.\nJonathan Doros: \nUnidentified Analyst: Hello, can you hear me? Hello?\nOperator: Adam, you\u2026\nJonathan Doros: We\u2019re switching over to another line in case you can\u2019t hear us? With that line, so can you repeat the question, please?\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Adam on for Jerry, can you hear me?\nJonathan Doros: Yes, we can hear you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about recent FX movements in context with the guidance?\nKevin Berryman: Yeah, look \u2013 thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one. As we\u2019ve seen actually over the last week a significant change in uncertain of the foreign exchange rates, specifically in pound sterling. But we do think that there\u2019s some incremental challenges in the second half relative to the potential associated with that probably $0.05 plus. But it\u2019s almost in the range of being able to offset that with other things going on in our guidance for the year. So as we think about going forward, certainly, there\u2019s an incremental risk profile that\u2019s developed over the last couple of days. But effectively, we\u2019re still holding to the gains at this point in time and we\u2019ll obviously be monitoring that on an ongoing basis.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then in your strategy update, you laid out expectations for PA Consulting revenues to grow 12% to 15% CAGR through 2024, but with margins flat. Is the assumption for flat margins the result of changing geographic mix? And then once we get a steady mix, how should we think about margin expansion in this business?\nKevin Berryman: I think that there\u2019s a couple of things going on as it relates to the mix dynamic. As we have said, in the past, the incremental strength of that business, even over and above kind of what the plans have been, both in our deal model and for the team at PA. They\u2019ve been running at very, very high utilization factors, which we don\u2019t believe is sustainable longer term. So it\u2019s really more about getting back to a utilization rate that\u2019s probably more sustainable longer-term, which mitigates upward trends in gross margin and profitability. But that ultimately, that level of profitability is being held longer-term just because of the incremental strength of the margin profile of the new business coming in. So all-in-all, while it\u2019s a flat margin outlook, it\u2019s a really strong underlying because they\u2019re actually increasing or decreasing their utilization by factors, which has been offset by underlying gross margin improvements in the business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Hi, good morning.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nBert Subin: Bob, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned semi and EV CapEx is rising cost the industry, I think that comes as no surprise to anyone. How are you thinking about the growth progression of advanced facilities as you sort of marched towards your $10 EPS target?\nBob Pragada: Strong. I think that right now that business, Bert, it\u2019s anywhere from 12 to 18 months kind of look forward, sometimes 6 for the first time in a long time for us being in that space. We\u2019re seeing visibility from a pipeline perspective well into 2023, and in certain cases into 2024. So, in this strategy cycle, it will play a play on material part.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nKevin Berryman: Good morning, Mike.\nBob Pragada: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe for, I mean, have you intrigued about a couple of things. One, could you discuss maybe, Bob, the pipeline, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that $25 billion and $15 billion on CMS side. We will have more discussion on the pipeline opportunities you mentioned just now the event facilities, but other areas, I said, you indicate some more international exposure that could be supportive in addition to what\u2019s the IIJ will provide. And Kevin, the book-to-bill on the margin of 1.12 is an interesting data point. How\u2019s that compare? How\u2019s that trend? And, as we think about not only better bookings, but better margins into that backlog and over the next, say, several quarters.\nJonathan Doros: Hey, Bob or Kevin, who want to go first?\nSteve Demetriou: I\u2019ll pick it up here. It\u2019s Steve. So the look on \u2013 as far as moving to the other, Kevin talked about PA. But as far as P&PS goes, as Bob said, we\u2019re going to see continued strength in advanced facilities moving through the rest of this year and into the next few years. And then on the back of that, we\u2019re going to start to see the Americas business wrap up, we\u2019re already seeing the pipeline significantly increase, we\u2019ll start to see sequential growth in the second half of this year and P&PS U.S. And we expect that to really start to ramp up more significantly as we enter 2023. As far as the infrastructure stimulus, that incremental $550 billion of money that is going to flow into the U.S., about close to $100 billion has been specifically earmarked for defined programs and projects. And, we\u2019re tracking that and obviously, in the front end of that grant process, early on a lot of that is going to be formulaic. And so that should start to flow nicely as we enter 2023. And then our federal infrastructure business and environmental, because of a lot of the dynamics going on globally should really be also something that\u2019s going to help drive growth. On the Critical Mission Solutions, what\u2019s really playing out nicely as the diversity of our portfolio. Right now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in telecom, obviously, the space intelligence and the fact that that classified win, cyber and intelligence is going to start to ramp up now as the continued resolution that finalized. And the ramp-up of our nuclear businesses is robust. And we have an excellent pipeline of opportunities that should start to hit as we finish up this year, and rolling to 2023. So, all-in-all, we\u2019re pretty excited about the prospects of the second half, and especially as we move into 2023 and beyond. And as far as that gross profit, book-to-bill \u2013 the bookings in the last quarter specifically, was more significant and margin because of a higher professional services ratio. And so, what we are seeing is an increase in book-to- bill on our gross profit, as you\u2019ve outlined, that we\u2019re pretty excited about that going forward.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Kevin, I heard a very clear top-line growth outlook for CMS in the second half, but I\u2019m not sure I heard one for PPS. I\u2019m just curious, is there still some variability there that that keeps you from putting some bumpers on the PPS trajectory into the second half? I guess, what I\u2019m really trying to get at is that, all in sort of exit growth rate as we\u2019re going into 2023? So any color or perspective you can provide around that would be very helpful.\nKevin Berryman: Look, the dynamic associated with calling out of the CMS is really, because of the strong growth that we\u2019re seeing in the second half of the year, what CMS wanted to make sure that we call that out. It\u2019s not editorial comment on lack of growth in People & Places. We do believe sequentially, we\u2019re going to be able to see some growth as we get into Q3, and when you compare to the year ago figures that that means an accelerating level of growth as well. So look it\u2019s not necessarily in the double-digit figures that we were talking about in CMS, but we see sequential growth in third quarter versus second quarter, even stronger in Q4 versus Q3. So, we think, we\u2019re getting positioned for a strong Q2 \u2013 2023 as a result of that. So look, I think, what\u2019s really attributed to the teams here is a great work that our program management office is doing and really highlighting and helping sort out the incremental monies that are going to be coming into play for the infrastructure bill, and helping our customers figure out when that\u2019s going to hit where they aren\u2019t going to be able to gain access. And I think that\u2019s going a long way for us to start to identify that longer-term build in our infrastructure pipeline. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it.\nSteve Demetriou: And just to \u2013 the one other point about P&PS that as we look at sequentially moving into the third, fourth quarter is the \u2013 a margin profile is going to improve with the G&A that we pre-invested that Kevin talked about that held down on margins in the second quarter. We\u2019re going to start to see a significant change in the utilization of that G&A that\u2019s going to give us a much better profile in the second half on a margin.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Brandon on for Chad. Can you please give some more color on the volume of new inquiries on the infrastructure design side? How\u2019s that picked up year-over-year? And when do you think this activity will peak over the next few years?\nJonathan Doros: Bob, can you hear that?\nBob Pragada: Sure. Yeah, I did. So, incrementally, when you look at it from Q2 to Q2 standpoint, 2021 to 2022. But if you look at the bookings profile of what we accomplished in Q2, and how those jobs burn over the course of the next 2 to 3 quarters, it is a unique inflection point that we\u2019re seeing in the business. And those are on the front end studies, and on some of these more lumpy jobs that were actually already in the planning mode. And now when the CR  was approved, and monies were available. These were the immediate recipients of these jobs, which are going to really hone in on that design component. So we\u2019re actually feeling good outside of the U.S., we are seeing some of the biggest rail and transit opportunities haven\u2019t booked them yet. But we\u2019re in the middle of them that we have in quite a bit \u2013 quite a long time, specifically in the UK and in Australia, so overall positive.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. So you narrow your range and that suggests more confidence in your outlook in general. I guess, wondering what you see as still the biggest areas of uncertainties. And more typically, with Jacobs, we would expect kind of still some upside potential on the upper end of the range. So by taking that down, I\u2019m wondering if there are other things that that we should be considering here this sort of upside scenarios and downside scenarios,\nSteve Demetriou: Yeah, I think, obviously, raising the bottom was an indication of more confidence. The top side, I\u2019d say is, what\u2019s on our mind is the FX uncertainty that\u2019s out there, specifically. And just the question of with all this political activity, geopolitical activity, just how projects and programs are going to get across the finish line and get awarded. We\u2019re confident that there\u2019s no concern about anything getting canceled, it\u2019s really more around just the timing of how things unfold in the second half. And so that\u2019s where we sort of decided to keep our midpoint where it is in spite of the strong second quarter.\nOperator: And our next question will come from   with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a commentary around invest the strategic investments ahead of the infrastructure bill, can you maybe talk about where in the lifecycle of those investments you are? Is this something that\u2019s going to continue until you sort of have full run rate contribution from the bill? And just the second part in terms of the indicator, there\u2019s some gains coming in from the U.S. IIJ. How are those coming in relative to what you would have expected at this point in the timeline things?\nSteve Demetriou: Let me go first, and certainly address the strategic investments. We have investments that are supporting the focus 2023 initiatives, which are substantive this year, specifically, and will depending upon how the program goes forward will be less into the future, but more substantive this year specifically. I think the biggest number though, in terms of the investments really are people related, because we\u2019re building up our employee headcount, specifically relative to be able to satisfy the developing pipeline that\u2019s there. And ultimately, when that translates into our backlog and starts to burn, we need to make sure we\u2019re ahead of the curve as it relates to being able to deliver the high quality and strategic value added solutions that we provide to our clients. So that\u2019s the single biggest. So as we start to get that momentum build, which we talked about sequential growth in People & Places and CMS, when you have a particular part of our teams, which are occupied 50% of the time versus 85% of the time that that idle time ultimately is charged to our G&A figure. So as we start to ramp that G&A numbers are going to come, those G&A numbers come down, profitability goes up. And fundamentally, that\u2019s the single biggest investment we\u2019re making this in terms of the people.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for, Kevin, I wanted to ask about the adjusted unallocated corporate expense, comments that you had here in the prepared remarks, I guess, you said, you\u2019re going to be at the lower end of the $200 million to $250 million range. I guess, in the quarter it came in at $41 million had been running in the mid-50s. The guidance it just implies that the last 2 quarters, they are going to be around 50 each if it\u2019s the very low end. And so that implies that something unique happened in the fiscal second quarter, and I was wondering if you could discuss what that was that made it so low in the second quarter? And if you could also talk a little bit more about the tax rate in the quarter, the $0.07 that you called out there? What was that related to? It sounds like your tax rate is going to be higher? Was this an adjustment only for this year? Or was this for a prior period outside of this year as to why that $0.07 was called out?\nKevin Berryman: No. Look, let me go to the G&A first and talk about that really is a matter of timing, as to when we\u2019re making the investments as opposed to one we\u2019re not. And so think about it really from a timing perspective, in terms of the management of our programs, and we don\u2019t pre-spend when we don\u2019t need to. So ultimately think about it from a timing perspective, that\u2019s really all it is, Andy. As it relates to the other issue on tax, but effectively, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, beginning last year, we took to on our adjusted tax rate, just to book to what our expected effective tax rate is going to be for the year. And then, of course, our GAAP rate fluctuates around that either plus or minus relative to that. So really, this is just an adjustment to get back to put that effective tax rate is going to be on an adjusted basis for the full year. Until which time we think that number is different, we will always book to that adjusted figure in the quarter so that really is all it is. And it\u2019s just the difference between the GAAP and the adjusted figure that we expect for the full year. Hopefully, that\u2019s clear.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Thanks so much for the follow-up. I just got cut off earlier and had a quick clarification question for Bob. On the advanced facilities commentary, the visibility, you mentioned sort of being more extended, is that the result of just what we\u2019re seeing on the semiconductor CapEx side? Or are you also starting to see a step function change on the EV and biotech side? Thanks again for the question.\nBob Pragada: Yeah, Bert is both. Semiconductor side, it\u2019s really kind of the concentration of clients that we have and those clients being on the forefront of the chip shortage. And as well as one of those clients that we\u2019ve talked about before also changing a bit of the business model to become more of a foundry. So that\u2019s extending out that visibility. From an EV perspective, the biggest one is one that\u2019s driving some of that visibility and the spend that company is going through, but these not just the classic OEMs, the Fords, the GMs. But we\u2019re seeing kind of this next generation of EV providers come into play, which is giving us greater visibility to 2023 and beyond. So we\u2019re getting that information from our clients not necessarily exclusively market data.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nKevin Berryman: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Maybe you could give us a little more color into the double-digit growth forecast for CMS in the second half of the year, which I think is better than some of your government services peers, obviously, we know about Idaho, ramping up and some of the recent wins. But how much is cyber helping? For instance, I think you mentioned telecom ramping up and one of your peers suggested space is a little sluggish right now, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that for you?\nKevin Berryman: Look, as I outlined in our previous remarks earlier in the call. And yes, look, I think there\u2019s a multitude of things. There\u2019s a little bit of incremental revenue we\u2019ll see from the ramp on the Idaho project. That\u2019s not the driver. That\u2019s ultimately a small piece of it. It really is the incremental space intelligence business that\u2019s starting to burn relative to the wind that we announced. I think it was last quarter and that\u2019s going to be helping drive some incremental growth. And then, of course, we also are seeing good cybersecurity ramp in terms of the continuing resolution was putting pressure as it relates to that opportunity. So those are all positives, as it relates to telecom, while it\u2019s not a huge part of our business. It is a high growth business that\u2019s occurring, given the focus on the 5G stuff. So all of that added together, I think, exhibits the power of the diversity of the portfolio within CMS. And until we\u2019re excited about getting back to really strong growth numbers in Q3 and Q4, and we\u2019ve been calling out that we expected it to happen, and now it\u2019s going to be happening.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I apologize. I\u2019m managing through 4 calls. But, we\u2019re getting lots of questions from investors on just \u2013 which business models would be more resilient, during a potential recession, given the macro concerns out there? So can you sort of just help me understand which parts of your business would be more resilient sort of on a top line and margin side? And to what degree do some of the restructuring and cost cutting actions help you and as well how PA Consulting performed in prior downturns? And then, Kevin, my other question, just \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, if you ask this \u2013  , then I can just go back. But to what degree, what are you thinking right now, in terms of preference for repo versus acquisition, I know you did buyback stock and acquire, but any help there? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: Let me start with resilience. Let\u2019s turn it over to Kevin, for the capital deployment question. But look, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this, Jamie, as you know, and we believe we really positioned our portfolio going forward to be even more resilient than Jacobs in the past, which had a good resilient track record. Clearly leading that is going to be the infrastructure side with the fact that as we get into potential uncertainty and economic sluggishness that governments around the world, especially in the U.S. We\u2019re going to look to stimulate the economy and create jobs with infrastructure. And then on top of that, we\u2019ve got the IIJA that law. And so we\u2019re pretty positive about the momentum on that in the backlog, that pipeline that\u2019s building, and that\u2019s going to play out. And then, of course, we have \u2013 what\u2019s going on with the whole geopolitical side, the increased needs around defense spending and cyber protection and critical infrastructure around the world. And so that\u2019s going to bode well for resiliency on our critical mission solutions. And then even in the advanced facilities business, which could be historically impacted by economic slowdown with the dynamics of a chip shortage, which is going to continue even in some economic downturn, and the need to pent-up demand on life sciences, because of all the focus on the pandemic, and the energy transition that has to happen. We feel pretty good about where Jacob stands, uncertain environment going forward. Kevin, on the capital deployment?\nKevin Berryman: Yeah, we \u2013 thanks, Jamie, for the question. We like the investment in the shares at this current time. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a list of opportunities on the M&A side that that could potentially be executed against with the recent large settlement that we will be paying out in relative to the impacts. We\u2019re probably not doing any real large deals at this particular point in time, but certainly given the dislocation in our share price over the last few months. So we\u2019d like that investment. So I think, certainly, repos are in the mix and probably maybe some smaller acquisitions.\nOperator: And that will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Steve Demetriou for any closing remarks.\nSteve Demetriou: Thanks everyone for your attention and focus, and we look forward to talking to you next year. Thanks.\nOperator: And I will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good day to all that are joining us on the call today. Like to turn to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter fiscal 2022 results. Second quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year, although net revenue grew 10% and was up 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points, and given current spot FX rates, we expect FX pressure to continue for the remainder of the year. Exiting Q2, we fully lapped the impact from the lower margin CMS procurement contract and the timing difference between our 2 large environmental remediation contracts. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect total net revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26.6%, up 80 basis points driven by improvement in People & Places and PAs improved mix impact, partially offset by the revenue ramp from the large new environmental remediation project win in CMS. Looking past 2022, as we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix. We expect our gross margins to continue to expand. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 16.5% down slightly from our first quarter. Within G&A, we are making investments to prepare for the increase in opportunities from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure stimulus, as well as other investments to improve the efficiency of businesses, who are focused 2023 initiative. We expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to trend lower for the remainder of the fiscal year. GAAP operating profit was $166 million and was mainly impacted by $99 million charge associated with the Legacy CH2M Matter we disclosed in April and other related legal costs. Also included in GAAP operating profit was $48 million of amortization costs from acquired intangibles. Other acquisition deal costs and restructuring efforts were $18 million, with around half related to acquisition related costs. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 7% year-over-year, and down slightly on a pro forma basis. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.1%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.68 per share, and included the $0.63 charge related to the settlement of the previously mentioned Legacy CH2M Matter and related legal costs. A $0.25 impact related to our amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.09 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower and a $0.07 impact from a higher tax rate in the quarter versus our expected rate for the full year. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.72. Jacobs consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $340 million, and was up nearly 3% year-over-year and represented 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, the revenue book-to-bill ratio was just under 1.94 times, but was 1.12 on a gross profit basis, as we saw a continued increase in profitability in our backlog. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS Q2 revenue was up 4% year-over-year and up 3% on our pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by nearly 100 basis points. During the quarter, CMS revenue growth left the impact from the contract run off of a lower margin large procurement contract and benefited from the timing of our large DOE environmental remediation win at Idaho. As a result, we expect CMS revenue to show double-digit second half 2022 revenue growth driven by strong performance in space intelligence from our recent large new award continued increase from the large environmental contracts to its expected full run rate. Accelerating performance in our telecom business driven by a strategic relationships with 5G providers and Cyber and Intel awards delayed during the continuing resolution beginning to ramp. Q2 CMS operating profit was $113 million, down 1%. Operating profit margin was down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%. As expected, operating margins were impacted by the ramp up of our large environmental remediation win and the delay of the higher margin shorter cycle awards that were pushed to the right do the continuing resolution. We expect operating profit margin to trend slightly above Q2 levels for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Moving to People & Places, Q2 net revenue was up 2.8% year-over-year and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from foreign exchange. Our advanced facilities business net revenue growth, again, was up double-digits year-over-year, driven by investments in the semiconductor and pharma supply chains. We expect continued robust growth from advanced facilities throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong Q2 year-over-year growth, despite the impact from currency determined by more steady government funding. For the second half of fiscal 2022, we expect net revenue growth from our international business to moderate with pressure from the unfavorable impact of FX. Moving to People & Places Americas, net revenue growth in Q2 improved from Q1 driven by front end work related to the infrastructure stimulus. We're seeing the benefit from the budget resolution and meaningful build in our 12 to 18 months pipeline from the infrastructure stimulus projects. Our second quarter gross margin bookings and pipeline provides us confidence in sequential gross profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 versus the first half. Total P&PS Q2 gross profit grew year-over-year, but Q2 operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by increased G&A expenses as we continued to spend, again, strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PAs performance, PA contributed $297 million in revenue, and $68 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q2 revenue grew 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 19% in constant currency. Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 23%. As a quick reminder, PA grew revenue and constant currency 24% year-over-year for fiscal year 2021 and delivered a 23% operating profit margin, thus making year-to-date revenue and margin performance even more impressive. Our non-allocated corporate expenses were $41 million, up year-over-year and within our expectations as medical costs moderated. We now expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be at the lower end of our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Let's turn now to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid cash flow generation with $96 million from reported free cash flow, which was in line with our expectations given the timing of PA employee tax-related costs associated with their annual bonus payments, and the net working capital impact of discrete items which effectively offset each other. DSOs ticked up modestly year-over-year driven by the timing of new CMS wins and the ramp of the large environment Idaho win in our CMS line of business. The quarter's cash flow included a net $40 million cash benefit related to monetizing an Australian dollar FX had related to the CH2M legal matters settlement partially offset by cash restructuring. To date since March, we have repurchased approximately $135 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistically repurchase our shares. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be affected by the gross cash settlement of the CH2M related legal matter of $480 million, with nearly $100 million in cash tax benefits, partially offsetting that amount over the next few quarters. Adjusting for the impact of the legal sub settlement, other restructuring items, we remain on track toward achieving our onetime free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income target and expect similar or better free cash flow conversion going forward. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.2 billion resulting in $2 billion of net debt. Pro forma for the legal settlement, and including our estimated second half cash flow, we expect Q4 net debt to adjusted 2022 EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which we recently announced. Now, I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide 14. Yeah, look \u2013 thanks for the question. It's a good one. As we've seen actually over the last week a significant change in uncertain of the foreign exchange rates, specifically in pound sterling. But we do think that there's some incremental challenges in the second half relative to the potential associated with that probably $0.05 plus. But it's almost in the range of being able to offset that with other things going on in our guidance for the year. So as we think about going forward, certainly, there's an incremental risk profile that's developed over the last couple of days. But effectively, we're still holding to the gains at this point in time and we'll obviously be monitoring that on an ongoing basis. I think that there's a couple of things going on as it relates to the mix dynamic. As we have said, in the past, the incremental strength of that business, even over and above kind of what the plans have been, both in our deal model and for the team at PA. They've been running at very, very high utilization factors, which we don't believe is sustainable longer term. So it's really more about getting back to a utilization rate that's probably more sustainable longer-term, which mitigates upward trends in gross margin and profitability. But that ultimately, that level of profitability is being held longer-term just because of the incremental strength of the margin profile of the new business coming in. So all-in-all, while it's a flat margin outlook, it's a really strong underlying because they're actually increasing or decreasing their utilization by factors, which has been offset by underlying gross margin improvements in the business. Good morning, Mike. Look, the dynamic associated with calling out of the CMS is really, because of the strong growth that we're seeing in the second half of the year, what CMS wanted to make sure that we call that out. It's not editorial comment on lack of growth in People & Places. We do believe sequentially, we're going to be able to see some growth as we get into Q3, and when you compare to the year ago figures that that means an accelerating level of growth as well. So look it's not necessarily in the double-digit figures that we were talking about in CMS, but we see sequential growth in third quarter versus second quarter, even stronger in Q4 versus Q3. So, we think, we're getting positioned for a strong Q2 \u2013 2023 as a result of that. So look, I think, what's really attributed to the teams here is a great work that our program management office is doing and really highlighting and helping sort out the incremental monies that are going to be coming into play for the infrastructure bill, and helping our customers figure out when that's going to hit where they aren't going to be able to gain access. And I think that's going a long way for us to start to identify that longer-term build in our infrastructure pipeline. So we're feeling pretty good about it. No. Look, let me go to the G&A first and talk about that really is a matter of timing, as to when we're making the investments as opposed to one we're not. And so think about it really from a timing perspective, in terms of the management of our programs, and we don't pre-spend when we don't need to. So ultimately think about it from a timing perspective, that's really all it is, Andy. As it relates to the other issue on tax, but effectively, as we've talked about in the past, beginning last year, we took to on our adjusted tax rate, just to book to what our expected effective tax rate is going to be for the year. And then, of course, our GAAP rate fluctuates around that either plus or minus relative to that. So really, this is just an adjustment to get back to put that effective tax rate is going to be on an adjusted basis for the full year. Until which time we think that number is different, we will always book to that adjusted figure in the quarter so that really is all it is. And it's just the difference between the GAAP and the adjusted figure that we expect for the full year. Hopefully, that's clear. Good morning. Look, as I outlined in our previous remarks earlier in the call. And yes, look, I think there's a multitude of things. There's a little bit of incremental revenue we'll see from the ramp on the Idaho project. That's not the driver. That's ultimately a small piece of it. It really is the incremental space intelligence business that's starting to burn relative to the wind that we announced. I think it was last quarter and that's going to be helping drive some incremental growth. And then, of course, we also are seeing good cybersecurity ramp in terms of the continuing resolution was putting pressure as it relates to that opportunity. So those are all positives, as it relates to telecom, while it's not a huge part of our business. It is a high growth business that's occurring, given the focus on the 5G stuff. So all of that added together, I think, exhibits the power of the diversity of the portfolio within CMS. And until we're excited about getting back to really strong growth numbers in Q3 and Q4, and we've been calling out that we expected it to happen, and now it's going to be happening. Yeah, we \u2013 thanks, Jamie, for the question. We like the investment in the shares at this current time. But that doesn't mean that there aren't a list of opportunities on the M&A side that that could potentially be executed against with the recent large settlement that we will be paying out in relative to the impacts. We're probably not doing any real large deals at this particular point in time, but certainly given the dislocation in our share price over the last few months. So we'd like that investment. So I think, certainly, repos are in the mix and probably maybe some smaller acquisitions."

The CMS business continued to strong backlog performance in the second quarter increasing 8% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. This strategy is underpinned by our focus on key capabilities tied to our growth accelerators, data and cyber solutions, Climate Response, and Consulting & Advisory across our core customer market of national security, space and energy. Three market trends that we are seeing offering continued strong growth this year and beyond include all-source intelligence, energy transition, and space exploration. Beginning with all-source intelligence, the increasing intelligence threat levels require analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial, and measurement and signature to allow for better real time decision making. All-source intelligence offerings are advancing to include specialized collection management, visualization, and dissemination as a service aligned to specific threats like drug trafficking, organized crime and threat finance. Jacobs' cyber and intelligence business has a full spectrum of all-source intelligence solution to guide our national security clients through these increasingly sophisticated digital threats. In the second quarter, Jacobs won the U.S. Army's intelligence operations support contract to provide comprehensive 24/7 all-source intelligence analysis to the Army's Joint Task Force, Combatant Commands, and Service Component Commands. Also, we were awarded a seat  on the DoDs and Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Data Readiness for AI development, which encompasses all tasks required to prepare, manage and secure dataset in DoD AI models and assist DevSecOps. Moving on to energy transition. Nuclear energy, along with renewables are critical components of the global energy portfolio to transition economies away from fossil fuels. There is now a growing recognition that to achieve net zero we must include the always on emission free generation that only nuclear power can provide. Every year, nuclear power averts  a gigaton of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 217 million cars. Power generated from nuclear provides stability and resilience to electrical grids, due to its unique ability to ensure 24/7 energy supply, regardless of weather conditions, and Jacobs is well positioned as a leader in delivering global nuclear solutions. We were recently awarded a contract by EDF Energy operator of the Sizewell B nuclear plant, located in Suffolk, UK, to support the extension of the station's operating life by 20 years to 2055. Another aspect of our nuclear science expertise is our strong remediation capabilities. Our environmental team has successfully faced in the Idaho cleanup project at the Idaho National Laboratory and won the Oak Ridge Reservation Contract to perform environmental remediation work for the Department of Energy in Eastern Tennessee. Finally, demand for space exploration. In past , Jacobs supported NASA and rolling out the fully integrated Space Launch System for the Artemis 1 mission with launch to occur this summer. Artemis 1 will be the first uncrewed flight mission in NASA's Deep Space Human Exploration Program. The Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025, including the first woman and first person of color. Also for NASA, we were recently awarded the NASA Ames test operations and maintenance contracts. The 5th consecutive victory for Jacobs on this contract, which we originally won in 1998, this 5-year $220 million win will book in Q3, but highlights the continuing and strong NASA-Jacobs partnership. This quarter, Jacobs was also awarded a contract from Australia's Department of Defense Space Command to support the implementation of new space capabilities in Deep Space Advanced Radar, Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance and Space Control. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our solutions in the second half of 2022 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 month qualified new business add more than $25 billion, including $15 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Now on to Slide 8 are discussed our People & Places Solutions business. Our strategy is being actualized in real time with strong quarter backlog performance at 9% growth, while building sales momentum across multiple markets and geographies, specifically, in our advanced manufacturing, health and life sciences and U.S. infrastructure markets. I will discuss the P&P results under the themes of supply chain diversification, climate response, data solutions, and infrastructure modernization. Starting with supply chain diversification, we continue to respond to increasing demand and supply chain realignment that secures supply for health and life sciences and semiconductor manufacturing. For example, we're seeing an expansion of both organic and contract manufacturing for life sciences capacity in the U.S., Ireland and Denmark. And in Singapore, we're bringing a world class team of clinical specialists and facility experts to reimagined sustainable patient-centered care models for expanded facilities at Alexandra Hospital. To address the global semiconductor shortage, Jacobs' leveraging global resources, expertise, and design automation to deliver critical capacity expansion for multiple semiconductor manufacturing clients in the U.S. and Europe. In a related industry, Jacobs is working with clients in all phases of the electric vehicle ecosystem, implementing state-of-the-art facilities that co-locate lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle production to improve system delays and resilience. Across geographies, alternative fuel planning continues to drive investment for transportation agencies with recent awards for Michigan and Nevada DoT to unlock U.S. Infrastructure Act Funding. Moving to Climate Response. Jacobs remains on the forefront of advising our clients on true carbon impacts in areas ranging from biodegradable materials with an award from NatureWorks to embodied carbon calculations with a recent study for a major data center client. We're seeing material pipeline growth in our climate response and energy transition portfolio, as evidenced by wins with national grid in the UK to deliver innovative clean energy transmission, a wind farm in Australia, large coastal resiliency programs in Louisiana, and an offshore wind project in the Northeastern United States to convert and underutilized port to support one of the largest most advanced offshore wind facilities in the country. In addition, our innovation investments in PFAS solutions have resulted in an award for its first-of-its-kind program to study nature-based remediation options at more than 35 airports across Australia. Moving to Data Solutions, our deep domain expertise combined with our digital platforms to bring world class technology-enabled solutions to our clients. Our recent acquisition StreetLight is working with Siemens and New York State to forecast impacts of renewables and EV charging infrastructure to plan strategic investment upgrade. In the UK, Jacobs and PA Consulting are transforming Hampshire  with multi-sector digitally enabled solutions to support economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. Additionally, we've had an exciting new win for smart connected and secure infrastructure with national highways and confidential manufacturing clients. Now, discussing infrastructure modernization, faced with aging infrastructure and financial and social equity challenges, Jacobs is helping our clients to reimagine infrastructure. In Melbourne, our delivery excellence resulted in a renewed contract with Yarra Valley Water representing up to 18 years of partnership. In Los Angeles, we are expanding our legacy of being a trusted adviser to the Department of Water and Power by delivering a $17 billion master plan development for water reuse facilities. And for the Port of Alaska, we were recently awarded a contract extension to create a safer, more efficient and resilient port with coastal protection. This quarter, we saw significant growth in rail and transit with 2 clients awarding Jacobs their largest expansion ever. This includes an underground rail line in Singapore and New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority leveraging of the U.S. Infrastructure Act to strengthen the regional rail system and equitably bridge communities. We also expanded our portfolio in Continental Europe in partnership with NIRAS with two 8-year framework agreements for the Copenhagen Metro and the Greater Copenhagen Light Rail. Overall, we're seeing double-digit pipeline growth that is strengthening due to global infrastructure stimulus across transportation, water, energy and environment, as well as advanced manufacturing. Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 8, as Steve mentioned, PA had another impressive quarter. Their unique digital consultancy services enables clients to accelerate new growth ideas from concept through to commercial success. This allows PA to capitalize quickly and efficiently on global trends and growth markets such as climate response, and health and life sciences. Specifically in the health market, PA continues to use it skills as a force for good, and it's currently advising the American College of Emergency Physicians on how to build and operate a first-of-its-kind national registry. This next generation digital platform will transform healthcare for the nation's infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Focusing on climate response, there are 2 examples which demonstrate the breadth of PAs capabilities. The first is for the UK government where PA provided consultancy services for a launch of a new infrastructure fund to drive the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country. Secondly, PA and the Swedish R&D and IP company PulPac continue to accelerate their exclusive global development partnership for the revolutionary patented technology. PulPac uses renewable pulp and cellulose to produce fiber-based packaging and single use products as an alternative to plastics creating up to 80% lower CO2 footprint. The partnership recorded 3 strategic confidential win this quarter and have developed a solid go-to market plan to the United States. It is evident from all these examples that PA continues to be a crucial part of our strategy with their alignment to Jacobs' 3 growth accelerators. I had the privilege of joining the 1-year PA Consulting and Jacobs' celebratory road show last month, attending sessions at 6 different PA offices in 4 different countries. PA CEO, Ken Toombs, and I met over 1,300 PA employees with extremely positive feedback. We continue to build on collective success during our first year, and I look forward to continued collaborative successes for our clients and the world. I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results. Strong. I think that right now that business, Bert, it's anywhere from 12 to 18 months kind of look forward, sometimes 6 for the first time in a long time for us being in that space. We're seeing visibility from a pipeline perspective well into 2023, and in certain cases into 2024. So, in this strategy cycle, it will play a play on material part. Good morning. Sure. Yeah, I did. So, incrementally, when you look at it from Q2 to Q2 standpoint, 2021 to 2022. But if you look at the bookings profile of what we accomplished in Q2, and how those jobs burn over the course of the next 2 to 3 quarters, it is a unique inflection point that we're seeing in the business. And those are on the front end studies, and on some of these more lumpy jobs that were actually already in the planning mode. And now when the CR  was approved, and monies were available. These were the immediate recipients of these jobs, which are going to really hone in on that design component. So we're actually feeling good outside of the U.S., we are seeing some of the biggest rail and transit opportunities haven't booked them yet. But we're in the middle of them that we have in quite a bit \u2013 quite a long time, specifically in the UK and in Australia, so overall positive. Yeah, Bert is both. Semiconductor side, it's really kind of the concentration of clients that we have and those clients being on the forefront of the chip shortage. And as well as one of those clients that we've talked about before also changing a bit of the business model to become more of a foundry. So that's extending out that visibility. From an EV perspective, the biggest one is one that's driving some of that visibility and the spend that company is going through, but these not just the classic OEMs, the Fords, the GMs. But we're seeing kind of this next generation of EV providers come into play, which is giving us greater visibility to 2023 and beyond. So we're getting that information from our clients not necessarily exclusively market data."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and an update on our newly launched strategy. In March, we shared the details of our new strategy boldly moving forward, which unleashes a culture of inclusion, innovation and inspiration across Jacobs, enabling us to execute against one of the most exciting periods in our company's history. Our excitement surrounding the new strategy is driven by multiple robust growth opportunities across all lines of business, with additional opportunities to accelerate our performance in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions. For those that are new to Jacobs, we are a professional services company that combines deep technical knowledge across a variety of scientific engineering and technology disciplines with cutting edge proprietary solutions. We serve a diverse set of sectors and global clients that are navigating the need to modernize their infrastructure and supply chains to protect national security, while embarking upon multiyear digital transformations across all facets of their operational environments. This dynamic creates a compelling opportunity for decades of growth for Jacobs. By staying true to our values and purpose, we are a company like no other, reinventing the way we solve problems and shaping the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients. During the quarter, net revenue grew 10% year-over-year with growth across each line of business. Bookings were strong across the company resulting in our revenue backlog up 9% year-over-year with an approving gross profit profile. We were awarded a record level of higher margin professional services and People & Places Solutions, including several strategic wins developing grants that will enable our clients to access funds from the U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act as well as an increasing number of larger opportunities entering our sales pipeline. Critical Mission Solutions benefited from the large space intelligence win, we disclosed last quarter, and PA Consulting had another outstanding quarter with 15% reported year-over-year revenue growth and 19% growth in constant currency, while delivering adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our Advanced Facilities business continues to achieve record year-over-year growth rates driven by wins in the semiconductor, life sciences, and electric vehicle sectors. Given our increased visibility and confidence for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook with no change to the midpoint. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to expect strong organic growth with healthy cash flow conversion that affords us the ability to deploy capital for enhanced value creation. Turning to Slide 5. As we outlined during our new strategy launch, we are a purpose-led company with deep domain knowledge and a track record of delivering solutions to combat the global climate crisis. With this sense of urgency top of mind, we have made significant achievements both internally and externally. With approximately $6 billion in revenue driven from ESG and climate-related solutions, we are playing a pivotal role in mitigating one of our generation's greatest threats. Working with our clients, we are co-creating solutions and energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation, resilience, natural resource, stewardship and ESG business transformation. Similarly, we have delivered on our corporate commitments through our significant emissions reductions and carbon neutrality status. And in April, we took another major step and launched our updated Climate Action Plan to align our net zero commitments with the new recognized international standard. Our ambitious commitments include ensuring every client project we undertake becomes a client response opportunity, achieving net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040 and maintaining carbon neutrality with 100% low carbon electricity for our operations. I'm also proud to share that we are one of the world's first companies in the first consultancy organization to have validated net zero targets approved by our Science Based Targets Initiative. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Thank you, Kevin. Our diverse portfolio has proven resilient, providing us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios with an asset-light business model and the ability to manage pricing during an inflationary environment. Given our increased visibility and competence for fiscal 2022, we are tightening our outlook and maintaining the midpoint guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.385 billion to $1.435 billion from the $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion previous guidance. And our adjusted EPS outlook is now in the range of $6.95 to $7.35 from $6.85 to $7.45, previously. Looking past fiscal 2022, our backlog performance and increasing sales pipeline provides us with the continued conviction in achieving the multi-year financial growth targets we provided during our March strategy launch. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Good morning. Good morning. I'll pick it up here. It's Steve. So the look on \u2013 as far as moving to the other, Kevin talked about PA. But as far as P&PS goes, as Bob said, we're going to see continued strength in advanced facilities moving through the rest of this year and into the next few years. And then on the back of that, we're going to start to see the Americas business wrap up, we're already seeing the pipeline significantly increase, we'll start to see sequential growth in the second half of this year and P&PS U.S. And we expect that to really start to ramp up more significantly as we enter 2023. As far as the infrastructure stimulus, that incremental $550 billion of money that is going to flow into the U.S., about close to $100 billion has been specifically earmarked for defined programs and projects. And, we're tracking that and obviously, in the front end of that grant process, early on a lot of that is going to be formulaic. And so that should start to flow nicely as we enter 2023. And then our federal infrastructure business and environmental, because of a lot of the dynamics going on globally should really be also something that's going to help drive growth. On the Critical Mission Solutions, what's really playing out nicely as the diversity of our portfolio. Right now, we're seeing a lot of strength in telecom, obviously, the space intelligence and the fact that that classified win, cyber and intelligence is going to start to ramp up now as the continued resolution that finalized. And the ramp-up of our nuclear businesses is robust. And we have an excellent pipeline of opportunities that should start to hit as we finish up this year, and rolling to 2023. So, all-in-all, we're pretty excited about the prospects of the second half, and especially as we move into 2023 and beyond. And as far as that gross profit, book-to-bill \u2013 the bookings in the last quarter specifically, was more significant and margin because of a higher professional services ratio. And so, what we are seeing is an increase in book-to- bill on our gross profit, as you've outlined, that we're pretty excited about that going forward. And just to \u2013 the one other point about P&PS that as we look at sequentially moving into the third, fourth quarter is the \u2013 a margin profile is going to improve with the G&A that we pre-invested that Kevin talked about that held down on margins in the second quarter. We're going to start to see a significant change in the utilization of that G&A that's going to give us a much better profile in the second half on a margin. Yeah, I think, obviously, raising the bottom was an indication of more confidence. The top side, I'd say is, what's on our mind is the FX uncertainty that's out there, specifically. And just the question of with all this political activity, geopolitical activity, just how projects and programs are going to get across the finish line and get awarded. We're confident that there's no concern about anything getting canceled, it's really more around just the timing of how things unfold in the second half. And so that's where we sort of decided to keep our midpoint where it is in spite of the strong second quarter. Let me go first, and certainly address the strategic investments. We have investments that are supporting the focus 2023 initiatives, which are substantive this year, specifically, and will depending upon how the program goes forward will be less into the future, but more substantive this year specifically. I think the biggest number though, in terms of the investments really are people related, because we're building up our employee headcount, specifically relative to be able to satisfy the developing pipeline that's there. And ultimately, when that translates into our backlog and starts to burn, we need to make sure we're ahead of the curve as it relates to being able to deliver the high quality and strategic value added solutions that we provide to our clients. So that's the single biggest. So as we start to get that momentum build, which we talked about sequential growth in People & Places and CMS, when you have a particular part of our teams, which are occupied 50% of the time versus 85% of the time that that idle time ultimately is charged to our G&A figure. So as we start to ramp that G&A numbers are going to come, those G&A numbers come down, profitability goes up. And fundamentally, that's the single biggest investment we're making this in terms of the people. Let me start with resilience. Let's turn it over to Kevin, for the capital deployment question. But look, we've spent a lot of time on this, Jamie, as you know, and we believe we really positioned our portfolio going forward to be even more resilient than Jacobs in the past, which had a good resilient track record. Clearly leading that is going to be the infrastructure side with the fact that as we get into potential uncertainty and economic sluggishness that governments around the world, especially in the U.S. We're going to look to stimulate the economy and create jobs with infrastructure. And then on top of that, we've got the IIJA that law. And so we're pretty positive about the momentum on that in the backlog, that pipeline that's building, and that's going to play out. And then, of course, we have \u2013 what's going on with the whole geopolitical side, the increased needs around defense spending and cyber protection and critical infrastructure around the world. And so that's going to bode well for resiliency on our critical mission solutions. And then even in the advanced facilities business, which could be historically impacted by economic slowdown with the dynamics of a chip shortage, which is going to continue even in some economic downturn, and the need to pent-up demand on life sciences, because of all the focus on the pandemic, and the energy transition that has to happen. We feel pretty good about where Jacob stands, uncertain environment going forward. Kevin, on the capital deployment? Thanks everyone for your attention and focus, and we look forward to talking to you next year. Thanks."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs\u2019 Fiscal First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast.  Thank you. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information regarding forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons, current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including BlackLynx as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full period. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3, before turning to the agenda, I would like to share that on Friday, March 4, we will be releasing a digital deep dive of our new Jacobs strategy. We also plan to attend the Raymond James Investor Conference on March 7 in Orlando and the BofA Global Industrials Conference on March 15 in London. Now, to the agenda. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be our Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and then discuss our data solutions strategy, including the acquisition of StreetLight Data; Bob will then review our performance by line of business; and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by a review of PA Consulting\u2019s financial profile as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide detail on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solution. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our key strategic initiatives. As we have stated before, we are on the front end of a multiyear growth cycle for the company. This is driven by a combination of secular growth opportunities in our core sectors such as U.S. infrastructure investments, climate response, a super cycle of supply chain investments in electronics as well as being at the nexus of disruptive new technologies in domains of space, cyber and software analytics. We expect these opportunities to drive accelerated revenue growth for the balance of the year. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we envision Jacobs as a company like no other, a company that combines deep domain knowledge of operational environments with the latest advances in technology. We are excited to share a more comprehensive analysis of our strategy at our March investor event. Now, let\u2019s discuss the first quarter results. During the quarter, in People & Places Solutions, our Advanced Facilities business delivered double-digit revenue growth and over 20% growth in operating profit, driven by our work with Intel and other global microchip customers, along with growth in life sciences and the electrical vehicle market. And in the Americas, we are also seeing the beginnings of projects related to the U.S. Infrastructure Bill enter our pipeline. Within Critical Mission Solutions, we had a highly anticipated significant backlog addition from our space-based intelligence surveillance reconnaissance group called Rapid Solutions. The remainder of CMS pipeline remains strong with substantial new award opportunities expected this fiscal year. PA Consulting continued to outperform, posting another triple-double with 21% revenue growth, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% and double-digit pro forma year-over-year backlog growth. Total Jacobs\u2019 net revenue increased 6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 11% during the quarter. In the first quarter, we experienced strong bookings. As a result, our overall backlog ended the quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 10% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong backlog growth dynamics of our business, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond 2022, we expect strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025, excluding any potential deployment of material capital toward M&A opportunities. At our investor event in early March, we will provide additional detail on how capital deployment and focused new growth opportunities can provide additional upside to this expectation. Turning to Slide 5, one of the most attractive opportunities for Jacobs is to expand our data and cyber businesses across three focus areas of specialized consulting, operational technology solutions and data analytics platforms. With a combination of strategic acquisition and key talent additions, we have built a strong business providing data and cyber solutions at scale to protect national security. Expanding beyond national security, as attempts by bad actors to cripple both public and commercial assets and facilities continues to increase we see accelerating requests for our data and cyber solutions from our critical infrastructure customers. We have developed and acquired a portfolio of high-technology solutions such as synthetic aperture radar technology and the BlackLynx edge computing platform, which we plan to further scale and commercialize. Jacobs also has numerous software-based analytics solutions across the water, transportation and environmental verticals, which is now enhanced with the acquisition of StreetLight Data, which I\u2019d now like to discuss in further detail. Moving to Slide 6, StreetLight Data is a vertical data-as-a-service analytics platform that helps customers gain insights into three high-growth areas. First is understanding mobility and last-mile supply chain analytics of all modes of vehicle and pedestrian movement as well as trip patterns both in recent and comprehensive historical data. Second is analyzing the impact of infrastructure investments, including how to plan the expansion of future communities and where and when to deploy electrical vehicle charging solutions and autonomous vehicles to enhance sustainable solutions. And third is measuring the social value impact of infrastructure investments on underserved communities and populations overall. As the U.S. prepares to embark on one of the largest infrastructure investments in history, having access to these analytics will be crucial, which is a new multibillion dollar market for Jacobs. We view the addressable market for StreetLight in three buckets: expanding market share with North American transportation-focused customer base; leveraging into other infrastructure segments such as water, environmental and the built environment; exploiting adjacent opportunities by expanding internationally and developing large disruptive use cases across multiple areas, leveraging Jacobs\u2019 portfolio of data and technology solutions, including geospatial technology and edge computing capabilities from recently acquired BlackLynx to create expanded market penetration, growth opportunities and solutions for our clients. The team at StreetLight has built the industry\u2019s leading solution, which is deployed throughout several U.S. and Canadian transportation authorities and municipalities. Specifically, StreetLight is multiple software development cycles ahead of the competition driven by its unique multimodal data analytics mode, proprietary algorithms and front-end user experience technology. We expect revenue to grow at over a 30% CAGR through 2025. A key part of our strategy is investing, aligning and integrating our data and digital capabilities to truly advance our scale and gain the financial economics of a high margin recurring revenue opportunity that further supports high value client solutions. This StreetLight acquisition is an important step in this direction. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions, during the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance with total backlog increasing 11% on a pro forma basis to $10.8 billion, driven by strategic new wins in space, cyber and intelligence. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth this year include spaceborne ISR, edge analytics and Intelligent Asset Management. Beginning with space ISR, our military leaders contend that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver our near-peer adversaries across multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect data much more quickly than airborne ISR, covering 35-fold the number of miles per hour. These small sats with radio frequency synthetic aperture radar provide time-critical intelligence in support of commercial and military missions. Jacobs continues to develop its advanced payload production and integration capabilities building on technologies from KeyW. With our recent successes, along with the integration of BlackLynx innovative software platforms, we have unlocked the opportunity to create a potential $0.5 billion annual recurring space ISR business longer term. Also during the quarter, Jacobs won a 36-month contract to provide state-of-the-art digital aerial imagery data that will be used to enhance precision agricultural practices in the Midwestern United States. The services will be provided using KeyW technology called GEOpod, which is a scalable, highly agile, airborne imagery system. Moving on to edge analytics, data is often utilized in challenging and unlikely places like the International Space Station, a military satellite, ships at sea, factory floors, water purification plants, traffic lights and neighborhood pharmacies. Data might traditionally reside in a data center or cloud, but many important decisions need to happen on the edge. Jacobs\u2019 recent acquisition of BlackLynx, an edge analytics leader in providing the sensors, software and analytic services, allows leaders to speed their decision-making exponentially. As edge computing proliferates across all domains, rapidly gaining actionable insights from the vast data becomes essential. We are already leveraging BlackLynx edge computing capabilities not only across CMS but also the infrastructure sectors of P&PS in 2022. Now in the area of Intelligent Asset Management, we\u2019re continuing to build on the solutions we developed with NASA centers and have now deployed at multiple U.S. Navy installations. Typically, these programs range from $250 million to $300 million over 6 to 8 years. We see a growing pipeline of opportunities that span across DoD, the intelligence community and commercial clients. The value for our clients is increased uptime and availability of the facilities at lower total life cycle costs achieved through targeted use of predictive analytics while simultaneously upskilling the workforce at these mission-critical complex installations. In summary, we see solid demand for our solutions in 2022 despite the headwinds of the continuing resolution, which will likely get extended through March. Although we are seeing some funding pushouts impacting our cyber intelligence and defense clients, there are pockets of new funding across our diverse U.S. government customer base as well as in commercial sectors like telecom, where 5G continues to advance. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining at $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Now on Slide 8, I\u2019ll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We started the fiscal year with strong financial performance, resulting in 10% year-over-year backlog growth. I will discuss our results across four areas, including climate response, supply chain diversification, infrastructure data solutions and infrastructure modernization. Starting with climate response, opportunities continue to increase related to energy transition. And this has resulted in growth across our end markets and client sectors, notably for grid resiliency, green hydrogen and renewable energy generation. Most recently, Jacobs was selected as a program management partner to Pacific Gas & Electric on their multiyear electric undergrounding program, the largest of its kind in the U.S. The ambitious program will bring 10,000 miles of power lines underground to mitigate wildfires in and near high fire-threat areas to respond to California\u2019s evolving climate challenges. Jacobs will provide a global interdisciplinary team as well as advanced technology approaches that draw on more than 30 years of experience with PG&E and other large complex undergrounding programs like SuedLink in Germany. This important win also leveraged our subject matter experts in PA for yet another synergistic win together. With our recent award at the Pembrok Power Station in the UK, we are building on our portfolio of industry leadership in the area of hydrogen-based power. And we\u2019ve been successful with multiple awards related to solar and wind renewable generation projects in Wyoming and Australia. Moving to supply chain diversification, as a result of the global supply chain challenge, all sectors in our advanced facilities business are in growth mode, with semiconductors, life sciences and electric vehicles leading the field. And across these sectors, our ability to leverage our global integrated delivery platform and data-centric execution on these complex facilities is a clear market differentiator. Our solutions include significant win with an Asia chip manufacturer, expanding capacity in North America, continued support of Intel with additional facilities, including new builds in the U.S. And Jacobs was awarded the delivery of the first data center building for a major colocation client in the southwestern United States. In Health and Life Sciences, we recently won a project with Spark Therapeutics, a Roche Pharmaceuticals company, to build a gene therapy innovation center in downtown Philadelphia to research, develop and manufacture state-of-the-art products. Jacobs continues to deliver sustainable facilities across life sciences, like FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies\u2019 new large-scale cell culture facility in North Carolina, the largest of its kind in North America with the goal of 100% clean energy utilization and cutting-edge waste disposal and recycling system. This is a great example of projects that enable us to deliver on our purpose of creating a more connected sustainable world. Critical healthcare for thriving communities is central to our purpose, and our teams are working with clients to advance outcomes, including design of a mental health facility serving communities in western Sydney, recent completion of a state-of-the-art surgical center in Central Florida and a major hospital redevelopment in Southeast Asia. Moving to infrastructure data solutions, combining our recent digital acquisitions of BlackLynx and StreetLight as well as our venture investment in Microgrid Labs, we are well positioned to provide our clients with technology-enabled solutions through enhanced analytics and insights. We are also ideally positioned to deliver unparalleled value to the transportation and electric vehicle ecosystem, including an innovative in-road charging system in the Midwestern United States with ElectReon. In the UK, we are expanding our support of climate risk mitigation and multi-community resiliency for the environment agency through continued innovation of our proven proprietary digital technology, Flood Modeller. Additionally, as part of the first water breakthrough challenge, we provided technical sport to Anglian Water and United facilities, which resulted in innovation awards in the area of artificial intelligence for system operation and climate resilient solutions. Touching on the infrastructure monetization,  in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a unique greenfield opportunity where Jacobs is delivering strategic planning and consultancy services to build towards a net zero future. In the U.S., we are supporting clients on major programs and projects to align with capital funding and investment plan. We were selected for these awards based on our industry-leading implementation and long-term delivery success. Specifically, Jacobs was awarded the next phase of a major water treatment facility in North Texas, the new Tollway Ship Channel Bridge in Houston, Denver International Airport\u2019s seventh runway expansion and a critical win with our long-time customers in New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In summary, our global capability and innovative solutions have continued to differentiate Jacobs and provide confidence in the strength of our business based on early positioning with our clients and longer term global infrastructure stimulus. Turning to Slide 9, let\u2019s review our PA Consulting business. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to significantly outperform. Their unique combination of outcome-driven strategic and digital consulting means that they are able to capitalize on the world\u2019s current megatrends of agile working, climate change, human health and safety and digital transformation. As an example, their clients\u2019 focus on hybrid working is creating new opportunities for PA in organizational agility and resilience offerings in a range of sectors, including financial services and life sciences. Digital consulting remains PA\u2019s broadest technical capability, supported by increases in the last year in data science, analytics and AI. Aligned with this, PA continues to add to its technology portfolio with offerings such as Oakdoor, a data diode which provides a new level of security for highly-sensitive data even for the most sophisticated segmented networks; iPredict, a groundbreaking AI system for predicting failures in critical electricity distribution which has led to exciting new projects and opportunities for public utility providers in the United States. And in the health market, PA has partnered with U.S. based medical device start-up, Bearpac Medical, to create the Casio pump drainage system, a digital handheld single-patient use device to improve patient care and comfort. PA maintains its strong relationship with the UK government and has secured two new contracts for smart metering and electronic monitoring services. In the private sector, PA successfully completed two projects with U.S. based commercial partners. The first with Rheia LLC is to develop a new air distribution platform to overcome material shortages and system installation challenges facing the homebuilding industry. And the second with TeakOrigin a food startup to validate and launch an innovative business model to expand market opportunity. PA continues to be an exciting part of Jacobs\u2019 portfolio and is a crucial part of our new strategy as we continue to grow in the consulting and advisory space. Over to you, Kevin.\nKevin Berryman: Thanks Bob. Now turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of first quarter fiscal 2022 results, gross revenue was flat year-over-year, driven by a decrease in pass-through revenue with net revenue up 6% and down 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Pro forma net revenue growth was impacted by the timing of large CMS wins and P&PS Americas customers evaluating investments from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill. I\u2019ll explain these dynamics a bit further during the review of the lines of business performance. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.4%, up 430 basis points. Consistent with the last few quarters, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both P&PS, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin to the total Jacobs\u2019 portfolio. We expect gross margin as a percentage of net revenue to remain in the 26% to 27% range for the remainder of fiscal 2022. As we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix, longer term, our gross margins will expand. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, we saw an increase in medical costs higher than our expectations, indicating some pent-up demand for medical care near the end of the annual plan period, which ends on December 31. GAAP operating profit was $177 million and was mainly impacted by a $72 million largely noncash charge associated with a strategic reduction in our real estate footprint as well as $47 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. The real estate downsize is the result of our ability to further leverage technology as we adapt to our new strategic ways of working. We are finding that our teams enjoy this flexibility, and we continue to see productivity increases in this regard. Adjusted operating profit was $308 million, up 19%, driven by PA posting strong double-digit growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year-ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was nearly 11%, up 110 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $1.03 per share and included: a $0.41 charge related to the previously mentioned downsizing of our real estate footprint; a $0.23 charge related to our amortization of acquired intangibles; $0.05 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower; and a positive $0.16 tax benefit in the quarter, effectively lowering our expected adjusted tax rate for the year to approximately 22%. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.56. During the quarter, PA\u2019s continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion, net of incremental interest. Jacobs\u2019 consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 11% year-over-year and represented 11% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, we posted a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x for Q1, driven by strength in both lines of business. The strong booking performance positions us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the remainder of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q1 2022 revenue was down 10% year-over-year and 12% on a pro forma basis. CMS revenue growth continued to be impacted by the contract runoff of a large, low-margin procurement contract and timing related to our transition on another large DOE contract. The combined year-over-year impact of the two contracts was approximately $220 million. When excluding the contract runoff, pro forma CMS revenue growth was up 5%, indicating a strong underlying positive growth profile. As a result, we expect CMS Q2 revenue to show solid growth, with second half 2022 revenue growth accelerating further as recent new wins and backlog begin to burn. For the full fiscal year, we expect reported revenue growth to be above 5%. While portions of our CMS portfolio are seeing some headwinds associated with unresolved continuing resolution in Washington, the diversity and strength of our balanced portfolio will more than offset that and drive solid organic growth. CMS Q1 operating profit was $111 million, up 1%. Operating profit margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 9.6%. The improvement for the quarter in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business as well as the timing related to transition of our large DOE contracts. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the 8% to 9% range through the balance of fiscal 2022 but improve longer term as our revenue mix from higher-margin wins improves. Moving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Our Advanced Facilities business net revenue growth was up double digits year-over-year, driven by the investments in the semiconductor supply chain. We expect Advanced Facilities to further accelerate its growth throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong double-digit year-over-year growth, driven by more steady government funding and a favorable first quarter of fiscal 2021 year-over-year compare. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we expect solid mid-single-digit net revenue growth for our international business. Moving to P&PS Americas, current revenues remained soft due to the delayed approval of the Infrastructure Bill. However, we are beginning to see some projects related to the Infrastructure Bill enter into our pipeline. Our first quarter bookings and rising backlog provide us confidence that the Americas business will show a sequential growth as we work through the balance of our fiscal year 2022. P&PS Q1 operating profit was down 2% year-over-year with a 13.2% operating profit margin, driven by increased G&A expenses as we remain committed to strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $290 million in revenue and $63 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q1 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in both U.S. dollars and pound sterling. Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22%. On the next slide, I will provide an additional overview of PA\u2019s financial profile. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $58 million, up year-over-year and slightly higher than our expectations, driven primarily by the increases in medical costs. We still expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Moving to Slide 12. We are approaching a year since we closed the 65% investment in PA Consulting, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. PA Consulting provides a unique combination of high-value strategic and digital consulting services to a diverse group of public and private clients. The exposure to these high-growth sectors is reflected in the company\u2019s ability to compound high double-digit revenue growth while maintaining operating profit margins well above 20%. Interestingly, U.S. publicly traded consultancies that have this type of financial profile are valued at more than 20x adjusted EBITDA, indicating that PA\u2019s performance profile offers upside to Jacobs\u2019 current valuation. At our upcoming investor event, we will provide further insight into PA\u2019s growth strategy. Turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, we had another outstanding quarter of cash flow generation with $302 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement, down 8 days year-over-year. And the quarter\u2019s cash flow included a $55 million cash payment for COVID-related deferred FICA tax payments. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be impacted by PA\u2019s cash payments associated with their year-end performance, higher cash taxes and an uptick in our DSO figures, given some discrete items that favorably impacted our Q1 results. Given our strong Q1 free cash flow performance and structural improvements in our collection processes through our Focus 2023 initiatives, we see increased conviction of achieving our 1x free cash flow conversion target. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3x, a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, and we recently announced an increase of 10% to $0.23 per share.  Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve.\nSteve Demetriou: Thank you, Kevin. Our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world has never been more relevant to now as advances in data analytics and edge computing power are unlocking our ability to deploy innovative technologies related to climate change, infrastructure and national security. Our proactive portfolio management to align ourselves to these long-term secular growth opportunities has provided us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios and even during the pandemic. We are now entering a stage where we are experiencing growth across all of Jacobs, and we expect accelerating top line growth throughout the rest of this fiscal year. We are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion and our adjusted EPS outlook of $6.85 to $7.45. Beyond the current fiscal year, our sales pipeline and robust end markets indicate continued strong performance. As I stated earlier, we anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS at fiscal 2025, with the potential for upside driven by deploying additional investment in our growth accelerators of climate response, data and high-value consultancy. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator:  And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess one question, understanding \u2013 well, congrats on the win on CMS in terms of the award, the space award. But \u2013 and at what point \u2013 I know you said margins this year sort of in the 8% to 9%. At what point do you think CMS margins can start to narrow the gap? When can you start to narrow the gap between CMS and P&PS margins? And then I guess my second, just, follow-up question. Obviously, there has been a lot of news about semi CapEx from some major customers. Intel announced some pretty sizable numbers a couple of weeks ago. If you could just sort of frame the opportunity for Jacobs as it relates to that and when we could start to see that in numbers? Thanks.\nKevin Berryman: So, let me take the first part, for sure, Jamie. This is Kevin. On the CMS margin profile, what we are going to be seeing in the last three quarters of this year is the ramp-up of our large Idaho nuclear contract, which is, as you know, has a slightly lower margin profile than the balance of the business. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s creating the 8% to 9% kind of figures that we talked about for the balance of the year. As we go into \u201823 and beyond, though, we really do believe that the ramp-up of the satellite work and various other items that are in backlog and/or in the pipeline, which we expect some success on, will result in us being able to start to build that margin profile up again, hopefully beyond 9% in 2023.\nBob Pragada: And Jamie, on the semi side, clearly, it\u2019s a growing part of our overall portfolio. We have been in the space for over 20 years, and the customer that we have kind of been on the forefront of is in fact, Intel and proud that we could even announce that for years that we couldn\u2019t previously. So, you will start to see it in the numbers as it becomes even a bigger part of our portfolio. But I think the good news is that as Intel diversifies not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S., we are right there with them as their critical technical and engineering partner. So, that\u2019s going to be a big piece of our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Good morning everyone. On Slide 16, you folks laid out a $5 billion ESG solutions revenue business. I am wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind just fleshing out the major components. I know water is about $2 billion or so. What are the major pieces? And what\u2019s the growth cadence that you are looking for in those lines of business, \u201822-\u201923 timeframe? In other words, how back-end loaded is that growth outlook that you lay out on that slide? Thanks.\nSteve Demetriou: So Jerry, we are going to \u2013 this is going to be a big topic for us coming up in Investor Day investor \u2013 the whole investor event, Jerry. So, not to deflect the detailed side of your question, but I think we are going to lay all that out and it\u2019s going to be pretty exciting. It\u2019s unfolding now every quarter. I mean the wins that we talked about, Bob mentioned this first-ever Jacobs opportunity to do the first-ever inductive charging system on a public road like the Midwest is a great example. What we are now doing in the U.S. and Europe to address resiliency and renewable energy logistics with underground cables, the PMG one being the specific opportunity. Green hydrogen, we have got a huge wind program, several big, huge wind programs across the globe. These are all unfolding now and we will be ramping up that number that you quoted literally every quarter as we proceed. So, we are going to get into that detail, but it\u2019s everything from decarbonization, energy transition, resilience, mitigation, adaptation, it\u2019s \u2013 and we will be spelling out some specific growth targets during the investor week.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Within the rapid solutions and the space assets you are building out, can you just help us break down those verticals and what you are thinking about total addressable market here? And then relatedly, that aerial imagery data contract, I think you said on the GEOpod. Can you just expand on that opportunity and the customer set there as well?\nBob Pragada: Sure. So Josh, the first part of the question is that if you look at kind of the cyber spectrum and then how it pertains to the overall ISR approach, I would kind of break it down into four main areas, on where we play and then there is the product component of it as well. So, the whole perspective around readiness, operations, insights and then new products development on creating platforms in order to even provide more security or more readiness or more insights is kind of how we look at it. And over the years, the acquisitions that we have done have now put us in a pretty premier spot of that. So, I think that, that is something that is going to continue to grow and puts us in multiple parts of that value chain in the ISR field. On the second part around GEOpod and what we are doing on the geospatial side, that really is an agricultural \u2013 there is clearly all kinds of applications as it pertains to infrastructure. The win that I was referencing is the commercial clients that looks at the whole kind of agricultural profile of, right now the U.S., but where we have these applications elsewhere too, and really helps on weather patterns and how the whole agricultural industry can be more efficient as the effects of almost the previous question, climate change, come into play. So, it\u2019s a nice kind of coordinated skill set that we have that even makes us bring that much more value for our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you can talk about a little more about StreetLight, discuss cross-selling opportunities, how we should think about the sales cycle about this product? And how long is it when during a project life cycle do the discussions kick off?\nSteve Demetriou: Yes. So, let me start the answer. I think what\u2019s important about StreetLight is we have been doing business with them for the last 6 years, so we have a lot of experience with them and have proven success. They are a validated, capability trusted, especially in the DOTs, Department of Transportations here in the U.S., although they have been focused on a handful or so of these Department of Transportations directly. And now what we bring is the opportunity to unleash that because we are one of the leading players in transportation not only in the U.S. but globally. The whole opportunity with StreetLight is a multimodal capability, which is unique in the industry. So, they are accessing data from mobile devices, connected vehicles, geospatial, IoT sensors. And then they have a very unique process technology and with very strong algorithms and being able to create data and visible insights that will lead to climate change solutions and being able to move infrastructure to underserved communities and the whole host of infrastructure needs in the transportation sector. And then specifically from a Jacobs\u2019 standpoint, the big opportunity is that we see the opportunity to work this technology into other infrastructure sectors where we are industry-leading like water, environmental, building environment. We are able to co-develop new products with them, bring this internationally, especially in areas like UK, where we are a major player in transportation and other markets in Asia, etcetera. And so it\u2019s \u2013 we see a tremendous opportunity is the reason why we expect greater than 30% revenue growth in this business over the next several years per year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hi, good morning guys.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Can you give us a little more color on how you expect CMS to trend over the year? I know, Kevin, you said still up over 5% for the year. I think that\u2019s just a little bit below your guide from last quarter. Is it possible to quantify the impact of the CR\u2019s uncertainty on your Q1 revenue? And have you seen any incremental interruption in Q2 from Omicron or supply chain? And do you need to display \u2013 you do need to display relatively significant acceleration in revenue to make your guidance. So, if you could just talk about your confidence in that.\nKevin Berryman: Yes, Andy, we feel pretty darn confident actually. There is a couple of things that are going on. The year ago comparison starts to dramatically change because of those two contracts having fallen off the year ago comparables to a large extent. So, by default, that underlying growth that we are showing actually in Q1 of 5% is going to do nothing, but get better as it relates to the numbers. So, while the kind of the headline number was the falloff in revenue, the underlying health of the business is at that number we talked about, 5%. So, you got the ramp-up of the Idaho project, which is going to be a substantive build in Q2 and then three and four as well. And look, I think the continuing resolution is impacting the piece of the portfolio that you would expect it primarily in the areas of, let\u2019s call it, cyber intelligence communities. But that \u2013 while that\u2019s an important part of our portfolio, it\u2019s not the biggest part. And so we are seeing some slowdown there, but we also see backlog and wins just waiting to be executed against. And we see all of that being able to happen a little less in Q2, but certainly Q3 and four. So, the ramp there is certainly robust in the remainder of the year and especially in Q3 and Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess related to the P&PS segment, I know there is typically some seasonal headwinds in Q1 relative to Q4 of the prior year. I guess the organic growth seemed to be relatively steady. I am wondering, is there \u2013 how does that compare to your expectations in the quarter? And is there any evidence you can give us today that the Americas design business growth rate is actually accelerating now on a sequential basis, or is it more just poised to come and that just still needs to play out as the rest of the year develops?\nBob Pragada: Yes. So Steve, I would say two things. Yes, the second part of your question first, we do see a growing pipeline in our Americas infrastructure business, and that\u2019s coming through in the bookings. And so I talked about the backlog growth for the entirety of the LOB. Our design business in the U.S., specifically around infrastructure, probably led the way on that backlog growth that we saw. So clearly, on the base business, without even the infrastructure bill, we are seeing the growth there. And then as the infrastructure bill, we are starting to see some tailwinds coming in, at least on a project basis from that, too. So, we are positive on that front. From a seasonality standpoint, I would say that it goes back to what Kevin said earlier. We saw growth. We also saw some costs come in with regards to medical costs and otherwise as well as preparation for people that we know are going to be full utilization as we progress the year. So, we like what we see.\nKevin Berryman: Just to maybe add a little bit there is that you talked about sequential numbers. And we would expect that Q1 of the year is going to be the low point for the Americas business. And we will start to see sequential growth going off of those numbers through the balance of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSean Eastman: Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to the satellite payload technology award in the quarter. I believe this is one that you guys had highlighted as sizable prospects, but maybe the more important element around it was that it was a platform for margin accretive growth in CMS. Could you maybe refresh us on that dynamic? Obviously, if you could put numbers on it, that would be great. But I just wanted to check back in there and make sure we understand the significance of that win.\nSteve Demetriou: Look, I think this is the sort of anticipated win, and we are very limited in what we can talk about because of the classified nature. But it\u2019s got a phasing approach to it, but this was the critical phase to win. And so now the momentum is going to start to build. And well \u2013 again, we are going to provide some more information during investor week. But what we see is that the way this thing can phase over the next several years and what it\u2019s got us into now is an opportunity to create a $0.5 billion rapid solutions business. And we will provide some more details on how we see that sort of unfolding when we get to investor week.\nKevin Berryman: And that starts to happen primarily in \u201823, the build on the project. So, the ramp will be likely mostly in \u201823.\nSteve Demetriou: As well as other client.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann from Baird. Your line is open.\nAndy Wittmann: Hi. Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I guess I just want to touch base with you and get your thoughts on the labor markets and your ability to find and keep talent today. Certainly, this is the forefront of many people\u2019s minds. And I wanted to understand how you are dealing with that today, what you are seeing in that marketplace, and if there is any net effect on the margin performance this year that you can discern from the rapidly changing inflationary labor market?\nBob Pragada: Yes, Andy, it is a tough market. And \u2013 but we \u2013 I think the cultural priorities that we have been focused in on over the 5 years-plus is really starting to \u2013 well, it has been paying dividends, but it\u2019s continuing to be on the forefront. So, yes, there is challenges. Our attrition levels are remaining actually pretty steady. And we are confident that we will continue to be able to grow despite those labor challenges. The other part I would say is that this is where the globality of our business really, really makes a difference, because we are able to source talent and expertise from our global platforms to deliver solutions locally. And that has really been accentuated and magnified during this period of some labor dynamics. So, we do feel like we are really well positioned for it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning everybody.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: So for Steve, the \u2013 you announced StreetLight this quarter, BlackLynx last quarter. I am sure you will elaborate more on the Investor Day, but maybe the thought on how \u2013 what type of \u2013 again, where you are looking, the size that we have been seeing in the last couple of acquisitions, that\u2019s something that investors may look to see going forward unless something sizable occurs, and relative to the balance sheet that you have now and certainly adjusting from your prior acquisitions, the comfort level you have to lever that up that\u2019s all required.\nSteve Demetriou: Look, just to put a perspective on that question because it really is important of what you brought up is that we have been involved as a company over the last 5 years to 10 years in the NASA intelligence arena on big data and digital transformation, intelligent assets. And so now taking that platform and with the acquisitions of KeyW, Buffalo Group, BlackLynx and StreetLight over the last 3 years or so. And then add on top of that, our new venture capital strategy of seed investments and partnerships with the likes of Hawkeye 360 and Microgrid Labs. And then a big data partnership ecosystem that we have developed and putting that all together, we are now poised and positioned with a large-scale capability for transformative data solutions across all of our Jacobs\u2019 domains. And that is a strategy we are going to continue to build on. In addition to climate, which we have talked about earlier in this call, this whole data solutions is going to be a big part of what we are going to talk about in the investor week and touch on the rest of your questions as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: Steve, Kevin and Bob, good morning.\nSteve Demetriou: Good morning.\nLouie DiPalma: You are productizing infrastructure data solutions with StreetLight and BlackLynx. How does cyber fit into your infrastructure data solutions strategy? And for context, in December, U.S. Cyber Command created a cross-functional group dedicated to defending U.S. critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. And you obviously have elite cyber talent in your critical infrastructure division from your acquisitions of KeyW and Buffalo Group. So, can you discuss \u2013 I know you will probably discuss more at the Analyst Day about how you can layer in cyber solutions into your People & Places Solutions division services portfolio?\nBob Pragada: Yes. Lou, you must have some superhuman powers on looking at what our deck looks like for the Investor Day, but the answer is yes. And it really gets exciting when you look at \u2013 these are algorithms that either index, filter or identify areas of risk in any type of data and data sets. And so the application of what we have to the infrastructure world is a natural transition. And we have already been working on that now. That, coupled with partnerships that we have in the marketplace, there is not an infrastructure project right now with major agencies, both in the U.S. and the UK, across the world in Australia, where we don\u2019t have a cyber component that\u2019s with it. So, we are in process of doing that right now for our clients, and that\u2019s going to become a bigger part of our business as we continue to go forward. But you appropriately said, it\u2019s a great skill set as cyber threats become as big of any threat that we have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Feniger: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I recognize you guys are touching and playing in many verticals right now and moving up the tech curve. The comment that peers are trading at 20x EBITDA or at least the PA consulting ones, when I think of capital allocation here for you guys, is it favoring M&A to build out that capability so you guys are more in that bucket and that basket, or do you feel you are already in that basket right now, your multiple is at a discount and maybe buying back shares to close that discount is more appealing? I guess just trying to evaluate if there is going to be more expensive acquisitions on the forefront to build out the capabilities and get to that peer group, or if you feel your capabilities are already checking the boxes and those are the right peers. Thank you.\nSteve Demetriou: I think we believe it\u2019s a combination because I do think what you commented on, what we have acquired and built both organically and with previous M&A, we feel like we are a large-scale player now. And so therefore, our \u2013 when we wake up every day, our priority is organic growth off of that platform. Secondly, any acquisition we do going forward is going to be rigorously compared to the alternative of buying back stock. And we have done that in the past. We will continue to do it. What may have looked like a pretty bold price on some previous acquisitions are now looking amazingly attractive in short periods of time. And PA is a great example, if you just \u2013 in less than a year, the whole multiple profile of our acquisition is amazingly attractive. I will just leave it like that. So, I think it\u2019s going to be a combination of going forward, that we will continue to invest in Jacobs and look at our stock buybacks. But from time-to-time, we are going to continue to build out this capability that we are really excited about. And \u2013 but it has to be a situation where we believe over the course of the first few years, we will all look back and say it was a very attractive price and not overpaying for something just because we got to get bigger. And that\u2019s \u2013 I think we have proven that in the past and we will continue to do that as we go forward.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Demetriou, I would turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.\nSteve Demetriou: Okay. Thank you everyone. We look forward to hopefully having a good engagement during investor week with many of you. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. Now turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of first quarter fiscal 2022 results, gross revenue was flat year-over-year, driven by a decrease in pass-through revenue with net revenue up 6% and down 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Pro forma net revenue growth was impacted by the timing of large CMS wins and P&PS Americas customers evaluating investments from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill. I'll explain these dynamics a bit further during the review of the lines of business performance. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.4%, up 430 basis points. Consistent with the last few quarters, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both P&PS, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin to the total Jacobs' portfolio. We expect gross margin as a percentage of net revenue to remain in the 26% to 27% range for the remainder of fiscal 2022. As we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix, longer term, our gross margins will expand. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, we saw an increase in medical costs higher than our expectations, indicating some pent-up demand for medical care near the end of the annual plan period, which ends on December 31. GAAP operating profit was $177 million and was mainly impacted by a $72 million largely noncash charge associated with a strategic reduction in our real estate footprint as well as $47 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. The real estate downsize is the result of our ability to further leverage technology as we adapt to our new strategic ways of working. We are finding that our teams enjoy this flexibility, and we continue to see productivity increases in this regard. Adjusted operating profit was $308 million, up 19%, driven by PA posting strong double-digit growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year-ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was nearly 11%, up 110 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $1.03 per share and included: a $0.41 charge related to the previously mentioned downsizing of our real estate footprint; a $0.23 charge related to our amortization of acquired intangibles; $0.05 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower; and a positive $0.16 tax benefit in the quarter, effectively lowering our expected adjusted tax rate for the year to approximately 22%. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.56. During the quarter, PA's continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion, net of incremental interest. Jacobs' consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 11% year-over-year and represented 11% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, we posted a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x for Q1, driven by strength in both lines of business. The strong booking performance positions us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the remainder of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q1 2022 revenue was down 10% year-over-year and 12% on a pro forma basis. CMS revenue growth continued to be impacted by the contract runoff of a large, low-margin procurement contract and timing related to our transition on another large DOE contract. The combined year-over-year impact of the two contracts was approximately $220 million. When excluding the contract runoff, pro forma CMS revenue growth was up 5%, indicating a strong underlying positive growth profile. As a result, we expect CMS Q2 revenue to show solid growth, with second half 2022 revenue growth accelerating further as recent new wins and backlog begin to burn. For the full fiscal year, we expect reported revenue growth to be above 5%. While portions of our CMS portfolio are seeing some headwinds associated with unresolved continuing resolution in Washington, the diversity and strength of our balanced portfolio will more than offset that and drive solid organic growth. CMS Q1 operating profit was $111 million, up 1%. Operating profit margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 9.6%. The improvement for the quarter in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business as well as the timing related to transition of our large DOE contracts. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the 8% to 9% range through the balance of fiscal 2022 but improve longer term as our revenue mix from higher-margin wins improves. Moving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Our Advanced Facilities business net revenue growth was up double digits year-over-year, driven by the investments in the semiconductor supply chain. We expect Advanced Facilities to further accelerate its growth throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong double-digit year-over-year growth, driven by more steady government funding and a favorable first quarter of fiscal 2021 year-over-year compare. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we expect solid mid-single-digit net revenue growth for our international business. Moving to P&PS Americas, current revenues remained soft due to the delayed approval of the Infrastructure Bill. However, we are beginning to see some projects related to the Infrastructure Bill enter into our pipeline. Our first quarter bookings and rising backlog provide us confidence that the Americas business will show a sequential growth as we work through the balance of our fiscal year 2022. P&PS Q1 operating profit was down 2% year-over-year with a 13.2% operating profit margin, driven by increased G&A expenses as we remain committed to strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $290 million in revenue and $63 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q1 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in both U.S. dollars and pound sterling. Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22%. On the next slide, I will provide an additional overview of PA's financial profile. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $58 million, up year-over-year and slightly higher than our expectations, driven primarily by the increases in medical costs. We still expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Moving to Slide 12. We are approaching a year since we closed the 65% investment in PA Consulting, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. PA Consulting provides a unique combination of high-value strategic and digital consulting services to a diverse group of public and private clients. The exposure to these high-growth sectors is reflected in the company's ability to compound high double-digit revenue growth while maintaining operating profit margins well above 20%. Interestingly, U.S. publicly traded consultancies that have this type of financial profile are valued at more than 20x adjusted EBITDA, indicating that PA's performance profile offers upside to Jacobs' current valuation. At our upcoming investor event, we will provide further insight into PA's growth strategy. Turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, we had another outstanding quarter of cash flow generation with $302 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement, down 8 days year-over-year. And the quarter's cash flow included a $55 million cash payment for COVID-related deferred FICA tax payments. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be impacted by PA's cash payments associated with their year-end performance, higher cash taxes and an uptick in our DSO figures, given some discrete items that favorably impacted our Q1 results. Given our strong Q1 free cash flow performance and structural improvements in our collection processes through our Focus 2023 initiatives, we see increased conviction of achieving our 1x free cash flow conversion target. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3x, a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, and we recently announced an increase of 10% to $0.23 per share.  Now I'll turn it back over to Steve. So, let me take the first part, for sure, Jamie. This is Kevin. On the CMS margin profile, what we are going to be seeing in the last three quarters of this year is the ramp-up of our large Idaho nuclear contract, which is, as you know, has a slightly lower margin profile than the balance of the business. So, that's what's creating the 8% to 9% kind of figures that we talked about for the balance of the year. As we go into \u201823 and beyond, though, we really do believe that the ramp-up of the satellite work and various other items that are in backlog and/or in the pipeline, which we expect some success on, will result in us being able to start to build that margin profile up again, hopefully beyond 9% in 2023. Yes, Andy, we feel pretty darn confident actually. There is a couple of things that are going on. The year ago comparison starts to dramatically change because of those two contracts having fallen off the year ago comparables to a large extent. So, by default, that underlying growth that we are showing actually in Q1 of 5% is going to do nothing, but get better as it relates to the numbers. So, while the kind of the headline number was the falloff in revenue, the underlying health of the business is at that number we talked about, 5%. So, you got the ramp-up of the Idaho project, which is going to be a substantive build in Q2 and then three and four as well. And look, I think the continuing resolution is impacting the piece of the portfolio that you would expect it primarily in the areas of, let's call it, cyber intelligence communities. But that \u2013 while that's an important part of our portfolio, it's not the biggest part. And so we are seeing some slowdown there, but we also see backlog and wins just waiting to be executed against. And we see all of that being able to happen a little less in Q2, but certainly Q3 and four. So, the ramp there is certainly robust in the remainder of the year and especially in Q3 and Q4. Just to maybe add a little bit there is that you talked about sequential numbers. And we would expect that Q1 of the year is going to be the low point for the Americas business. And we will start to see sequential growth going off of those numbers through the balance of the year. And that starts to happen primarily in \u201823, the build on the project. So, the ramp will be likely mostly in \u201823."

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions, during the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance with total backlog increasing 11% on a pro forma basis to $10.8 billion, driven by strategic new wins in space, cyber and intelligence. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth this year include spaceborne ISR, edge analytics and Intelligent Asset Management. Beginning with space ISR, our military leaders contend that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver our near-peer adversaries across multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect data much more quickly than airborne ISR, covering 35-fold the number of miles per hour. These small sats with radio frequency synthetic aperture radar provide time-critical intelligence in support of commercial and military missions. Jacobs continues to develop its advanced payload production and integration capabilities building on technologies from KeyW. With our recent successes, along with the integration of BlackLynx innovative software platforms, we have unlocked the opportunity to create a potential $0.5 billion annual recurring space ISR business longer term. Also during the quarter, Jacobs won a 36-month contract to provide state-of-the-art digital aerial imagery data that will be used to enhance precision agricultural practices in the Midwestern United States. The services will be provided using KeyW technology called GEOpod, which is a scalable, highly agile, airborne imagery system. Moving on to edge analytics, data is often utilized in challenging and unlikely places like the International Space Station, a military satellite, ships at sea, factory floors, water purification plants, traffic lights and neighborhood pharmacies. Data might traditionally reside in a data center or cloud, but many important decisions need to happen on the edge. Jacobs' recent acquisition of BlackLynx, an edge analytics leader in providing the sensors, software and analytic services, allows leaders to speed their decision-making exponentially. As edge computing proliferates across all domains, rapidly gaining actionable insights from the vast data becomes essential. We are already leveraging BlackLynx edge computing capabilities not only across CMS but also the infrastructure sectors of P&PS in 2022. Now in the area of Intelligent Asset Management, we're continuing to build on the solutions we developed with NASA centers and have now deployed at multiple U.S. Navy installations. Typically, these programs range from $250 million to $300 million over 6 to 8 years. We see a growing pipeline of opportunities that span across DoD, the intelligence community and commercial clients. The value for our clients is increased uptime and availability of the facilities at lower total life cycle costs achieved through targeted use of predictive analytics while simultaneously upskilling the workforce at these mission-critical complex installations. In summary, we see solid demand for our solutions in 2022 despite the headwinds of the continuing resolution, which will likely get extended through March. Although we are seeing some funding pushouts impacting our cyber intelligence and defense clients, there are pockets of new funding across our diverse U.S. government customer base as well as in commercial sectors like telecom, where 5G continues to advance. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining at $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We started the fiscal year with strong financial performance, resulting in 10% year-over-year backlog growth. I will discuss our results across four areas, including climate response, supply chain diversification, infrastructure data solutions and infrastructure modernization. Starting with climate response, opportunities continue to increase related to energy transition. And this has resulted in growth across our end markets and client sectors, notably for grid resiliency, green hydrogen and renewable energy generation. Most recently, Jacobs was selected as a program management partner to Pacific Gas & Electric on their multiyear electric undergrounding program, the largest of its kind in the U.S. The ambitious program will bring 10,000 miles of power lines underground to mitigate wildfires in and near high fire-threat areas to respond to California's evolving climate challenges. Jacobs will provide a global interdisciplinary team as well as advanced technology approaches that draw on more than 30 years of experience with PG&E and other large complex undergrounding programs like SuedLink in Germany. This important win also leveraged our subject matter experts in PA for yet another synergistic win together. With our recent award at the Pembrok Power Station in the UK, we are building on our portfolio of industry leadership in the area of hydrogen-based power. And we've been successful with multiple awards related to solar and wind renewable generation projects in Wyoming and Australia. Moving to supply chain diversification, as a result of the global supply chain challenge, all sectors in our advanced facilities business are in growth mode, with semiconductors, life sciences and electric vehicles leading the field. And across these sectors, our ability to leverage our global integrated delivery platform and data-centric execution on these complex facilities is a clear market differentiator. Our solutions include significant win with an Asia chip manufacturer, expanding capacity in North America, continued support of Intel with additional facilities, including new builds in the U.S. And Jacobs was awarded the delivery of the first data center building for a major colocation client in the southwestern United States. In Health and Life Sciences, we recently won a project with Spark Therapeutics, a Roche Pharmaceuticals company, to build a gene therapy innovation center in downtown Philadelphia to research, develop and manufacture state-of-the-art products. Jacobs continues to deliver sustainable facilities across life sciences, like FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies' new large-scale cell culture facility in North Carolina, the largest of its kind in North America with the goal of 100% clean energy utilization and cutting-edge waste disposal and recycling system. This is a great example of projects that enable us to deliver on our purpose of creating a more connected sustainable world. Critical healthcare for thriving communities is central to our purpose, and our teams are working with clients to advance outcomes, including design of a mental health facility serving communities in western Sydney, recent completion of a state-of-the-art surgical center in Central Florida and a major hospital redevelopment in Southeast Asia. Moving to infrastructure data solutions, combining our recent digital acquisitions of BlackLynx and StreetLight as well as our venture investment in Microgrid Labs, we are well positioned to provide our clients with technology-enabled solutions through enhanced analytics and insights. We are also ideally positioned to deliver unparalleled value to the transportation and electric vehicle ecosystem, including an innovative in-road charging system in the Midwestern United States with ElectReon. In the UK, we are expanding our support of climate risk mitigation and multi-community resiliency for the environment agency through continued innovation of our proven proprietary digital technology, Flood Modeller. Additionally, as part of the first water breakthrough challenge, we provided technical sport to Anglian Water and United facilities, which resulted in innovation awards in the area of artificial intelligence for system operation and climate resilient solutions. Touching on the infrastructure monetization,  in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a unique greenfield opportunity where Jacobs is delivering strategic planning and consultancy services to build towards a net zero future. In the U.S., we are supporting clients on major programs and projects to align with capital funding and investment plan. We were selected for these awards based on our industry-leading implementation and long-term delivery success. Specifically, Jacobs was awarded the next phase of a major water treatment facility in North Texas, the new Tollway Ship Channel Bridge in Houston, Denver International Airport's seventh runway expansion and a critical win with our long-time customers in New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In summary, our global capability and innovative solutions have continued to differentiate Jacobs and provide confidence in the strength of our business based on early positioning with our clients and longer term global infrastructure stimulus. Turning to Slide 9, let's review our PA Consulting business. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to significantly outperform. Their unique combination of outcome-driven strategic and digital consulting means that they are able to capitalize on the world's current megatrends of agile working, climate change, human health and safety and digital transformation. As an example, their clients' focus on hybrid working is creating new opportunities for PA in organizational agility and resilience offerings in a range of sectors, including financial services and life sciences. Digital consulting remains PA's broadest technical capability, supported by increases in the last year in data science, analytics and AI. Aligned with this, PA continues to add to its technology portfolio with offerings such as Oakdoor, a data diode which provides a new level of security for highly-sensitive data even for the most sophisticated segmented networks; iPredict, a groundbreaking AI system for predicting failures in critical electricity distribution which has led to exciting new projects and opportunities for public utility providers in the United States. And in the health market, PA has partnered with U.S. based medical device start-up, Bearpac Medical, to create the Casio pump drainage system, a digital handheld single-patient use device to improve patient care and comfort. PA maintains its strong relationship with the UK government and has secured two new contracts for smart metering and electronic monitoring services. In the private sector, PA successfully completed two projects with U.S. based commercial partners. The first with Rheia LLC is to develop a new air distribution platform to overcome material shortages and system installation challenges facing the homebuilding industry. And the second with TeakOrigin a food startup to validate and launch an innovative business model to expand market opportunity. PA continues to be an exciting part of Jacobs' portfolio and is a crucial part of our new strategy as we continue to grow in the consulting and advisory space. Over to you, Kevin. And Jamie, on the semi side, clearly, it's a growing part of our overall portfolio. We have been in the space for over 20 years, and the customer that we have kind of been on the forefront of is in fact, Intel and proud that we could even announce that for years that we couldn't previously. So, you will start to see it in the numbers as it becomes even a bigger part of our portfolio. But I think the good news is that as Intel diversifies not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S., we are right there with them as their critical technical and engineering partner. So, that's going to be a big piece of our business. Sure. So Josh, the first part of the question is that if you look at kind of the cyber spectrum and then how it pertains to the overall ISR approach, I would kind of break it down into four main areas, on where we play and then there is the product component of it as well. So, the whole perspective around readiness, operations, insights and then new products development on creating platforms in order to even provide more security or more readiness or more insights is kind of how we look at it. And over the years, the acquisitions that we have done have now put us in a pretty premier spot of that. So, I think that, that is something that is going to continue to grow and puts us in multiple parts of that value chain in the ISR field. On the second part around GEOpod and what we are doing on the geospatial side, that really is an agricultural \u2013 there is clearly all kinds of applications as it pertains to infrastructure. The win that I was referencing is the commercial clients that looks at the whole kind of agricultural profile of, right now the U.S., but where we have these applications elsewhere too, and really helps on weather patterns and how the whole agricultural industry can be more efficient as the effects of almost the previous question, climate change, come into play. So, it's a nice kind of coordinated skill set that we have that even makes us bring that much more value for our clients. Yes. So Steve, I would say two things. Yes, the second part of your question first, we do see a growing pipeline in our Americas infrastructure business, and that's coming through in the bookings. And so I talked about the backlog growth for the entirety of the LOB. Our design business in the U.S., specifically around infrastructure, probably led the way on that backlog growth that we saw. So clearly, on the base business, without even the infrastructure bill, we are seeing the growth there. And then as the infrastructure bill, we are starting to see some tailwinds coming in, at least on a project basis from that, too. So, we are positive on that front. From a seasonality standpoint, I would say that it goes back to what Kevin said earlier. We saw growth. We also saw some costs come in with regards to medical costs and otherwise as well as preparation for people that we know are going to be full utilization as we progress the year. So, we like what we see. Yes, Andy, it is a tough market. And \u2013 but we \u2013 I think the cultural priorities that we have been focused in on over the 5 years-plus is really starting to \u2013 well, it has been paying dividends, but it's continuing to be on the forefront. So, yes, there is challenges. Our attrition levels are remaining actually pretty steady. And we are confident that we will continue to be able to grow despite those labor challenges. The other part I would say is that this is where the globality of our business really, really makes a difference, because we are able to source talent and expertise from our global platforms to deliver solutions locally. And that has really been accentuated and magnified during this period of some labor dynamics. So, we do feel like we are really well positioned for it. Yes. Lou, you must have some superhuman powers on looking at what our deck looks like for the Investor Day, but the answer is yes. And it really gets exciting when you look at \u2013 these are algorithms that either index, filter or identify areas of risk in any type of data and data sets. And so the application of what we have to the infrastructure world is a natural transition. And we have already been working on that now. That, coupled with partnerships that we have in the marketplace, there is not an infrastructure project right now with major agencies, both in the U.S. and the UK, across the world in Australia, where we don't have a cyber component that's with it. So, we are in process of doing that right now for our clients, and that's going to become a bigger part of our business as we continue to go forward. But you appropriately said, it's a great skill set as cyber threats become as big of any threat that we have."

            "name": "Steve Demetriou",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our key strategic initiatives. As we have stated before, we are on the front end of a multiyear growth cycle for the company. This is driven by a combination of secular growth opportunities in our core sectors such as U.S. infrastructure investments, climate response, a super cycle of supply chain investments in electronics as well as being at the nexus of disruptive new technologies in domains of space, cyber and software analytics. We expect these opportunities to drive accelerated revenue growth for the balance of the year. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we envision Jacobs as a company like no other, a company that combines deep domain knowledge of operational environments with the latest advances in technology. We are excited to share a more comprehensive analysis of our strategy at our March investor event. Now, let's discuss the first quarter results. During the quarter, in People & Places Solutions, our Advanced Facilities business delivered double-digit revenue growth and over 20% growth in operating profit, driven by our work with Intel and other global microchip customers, along with growth in life sciences and the electrical vehicle market. And in the Americas, we are also seeing the beginnings of projects related to the U.S. Infrastructure Bill enter our pipeline. Within Critical Mission Solutions, we had a highly anticipated significant backlog addition from our space-based intelligence surveillance reconnaissance group called Rapid Solutions. The remainder of CMS pipeline remains strong with substantial new award opportunities expected this fiscal year. PA Consulting continued to outperform, posting another triple-double with 21% revenue growth, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% and double-digit pro forma year-over-year backlog growth. Total Jacobs' net revenue increased 6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 11% during the quarter. In the first quarter, we experienced strong bookings. As a result, our overall backlog ended the quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 10% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong backlog growth dynamics of our business, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond 2022, we expect strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025, excluding any potential deployment of material capital toward M&A opportunities. At our investor event in early March, we will provide additional detail on how capital deployment and focused new growth opportunities can provide additional upside to this expectation. Turning to Slide 5, one of the most attractive opportunities for Jacobs is to expand our data and cyber businesses across three focus areas of specialized consulting, operational technology solutions and data analytics platforms. With a combination of strategic acquisition and key talent additions, we have built a strong business providing data and cyber solutions at scale to protect national security. Expanding beyond national security, as attempts by bad actors to cripple both public and commercial assets and facilities continues to increase we see accelerating requests for our data and cyber solutions from our critical infrastructure customers. We have developed and acquired a portfolio of high-technology solutions such as synthetic aperture radar technology and the BlackLynx edge computing platform, which we plan to further scale and commercialize. Jacobs also has numerous software-based analytics solutions across the water, transportation and environmental verticals, which is now enhanced with the acquisition of StreetLight Data, which I'd now like to discuss in further detail. Moving to Slide 6, StreetLight Data is a vertical data-as-a-service analytics platform that helps customers gain insights into three high-growth areas. First is understanding mobility and last-mile supply chain analytics of all modes of vehicle and pedestrian movement as well as trip patterns both in recent and comprehensive historical data. Second is analyzing the impact of infrastructure investments, including how to plan the expansion of future communities and where and when to deploy electrical vehicle charging solutions and autonomous vehicles to enhance sustainable solutions. And third is measuring the social value impact of infrastructure investments on underserved communities and populations overall. As the U.S. prepares to embark on one of the largest infrastructure investments in history, having access to these analytics will be crucial, which is a new multibillion dollar market for Jacobs. We view the addressable market for StreetLight in three buckets: expanding market share with North American transportation-focused customer base; leveraging into other infrastructure segments such as water, environmental and the built environment; exploiting adjacent opportunities by expanding internationally and developing large disruptive use cases across multiple areas, leveraging Jacobs' portfolio of data and technology solutions, including geospatial technology and edge computing capabilities from recently acquired BlackLynx to create expanded market penetration, growth opportunities and solutions for our clients. The team at StreetLight has built the industry's leading solution, which is deployed throughout several U.S. and Canadian transportation authorities and municipalities. Specifically, StreetLight is multiple software development cycles ahead of the competition driven by its unique multimodal data analytics mode, proprietary algorithms and front-end user experience technology. We expect revenue to grow at over a 30% CAGR through 2025. A key part of our strategy is investing, aligning and integrating our data and digital capabilities to truly advance our scale and gain the financial economics of a high margin recurring revenue opportunity that further supports high value client solutions. This StreetLight acquisition is an important step in this direction. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Thank you, Kevin. Our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world has never been more relevant to now as advances in data analytics and edge computing power are unlocking our ability to deploy innovative technologies related to climate change, infrastructure and national security. Our proactive portfolio management to align ourselves to these long-term secular growth opportunities has provided us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios and even during the pandemic. We are now entering a stage where we are experiencing growth across all of Jacobs, and we expect accelerating top line growth throughout the rest of this fiscal year. We are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion and our adjusted EPS outlook of $6.85 to $7.45. Beyond the current fiscal year, our sales pipeline and robust end markets indicate continued strong performance. As I stated earlier, we anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS at fiscal 2025, with the potential for upside driven by deploying additional investment in our growth accelerators of climate response, data and high-value consultancy. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. So Jerry, we are going to \u2013 this is going to be a big topic for us coming up in Investor Day investor \u2013 the whole investor event, Jerry. So, not to deflect the detailed side of your question, but I think we are going to lay all that out and it's going to be pretty exciting. It's unfolding now every quarter. I mean the wins that we talked about, Bob mentioned this first-ever Jacobs opportunity to do the first-ever inductive charging system on a public road like the Midwest is a great example. What we are now doing in the U.S. and Europe to address resiliency and renewable energy logistics with underground cables, the PMG one being the specific opportunity. Green hydrogen, we have got a huge wind program, several big, huge wind programs across the globe. These are all unfolding now and we will be ramping up that number that you quoted literally every quarter as we proceed. So, we are going to get into that detail, but it's everything from decarbonization, energy transition, resilience, mitigation, adaptation, it's \u2013 and we will be spelling out some specific growth targets during the investor week. Yes. So, let me start the answer. I think what's important about StreetLight is we have been doing business with them for the last 6 years, so we have a lot of experience with them and have proven success. They are a validated, capability trusted, especially in the DOTs, Department of Transportations here in the U.S., although they have been focused on a handful or so of these Department of Transportations directly. And now what we bring is the opportunity to unleash that because we are one of the leading players in transportation not only in the U.S. but globally. The whole opportunity with StreetLight is a multimodal capability, which is unique in the industry. So, they are accessing data from mobile devices, connected vehicles, geospatial, IoT sensors. And then they have a very unique process technology and with very strong algorithms and being able to create data and visible insights that will lead to climate change solutions and being able to move infrastructure to underserved communities and the whole host of infrastructure needs in the transportation sector. And then specifically from a Jacobs' standpoint, the big opportunity is that we see the opportunity to work this technology into other infrastructure sectors where we are industry-leading like water, environmental, building environment. We are able to co-develop new products with them, bring this internationally, especially in areas like UK, where we are a major player in transportation and other markets in Asia, etcetera. And so it's \u2013 we see a tremendous opportunity is the reason why we expect greater than 30% revenue growth in this business over the next several years per year. Good morning. Look, I think this is the sort of anticipated win, and we are very limited in what we can talk about because of the classified nature. But it's got a phasing approach to it, but this was the critical phase to win. And so now the momentum is going to start to build. And well \u2013 again, we are going to provide some more information during investor week. But what we see is that the way this thing can phase over the next several years and what it's got us into now is an opportunity to create a $0.5 billion rapid solutions business. And we will provide some more details on how we see that sort of unfolding when we get to investor week. As well as other client. Good morning. Look, just to put a perspective on that question because it really is important of what you brought up is that we have been involved as a company over the last 5 years to 10 years in the NASA intelligence arena on big data and digital transformation, intelligent assets. And so now taking that platform and with the acquisitions of KeyW, Buffalo Group, BlackLynx and StreetLight over the last 3 years or so. And then add on top of that, our new venture capital strategy of seed investments and partnerships with the likes of Hawkeye 360 and Microgrid Labs. And then a big data partnership ecosystem that we have developed and putting that all together, we are now poised and positioned with a large-scale capability for transformative data solutions across all of our Jacobs' domains. And that is a strategy we are going to continue to build on. In addition to climate, which we have talked about earlier in this call, this whole data solutions is going to be a big part of what we are going to talk about in the investor week and touch on the rest of your questions as we go forward. Good morning. I think we believe it's a combination because I do think what you commented on, what we have acquired and built both organically and with previous M&A, we feel like we are a large-scale player now. And so therefore, our \u2013 when we wake up every day, our priority is organic growth off of that platform. Secondly, any acquisition we do going forward is going to be rigorously compared to the alternative of buying back stock. And we have done that in the past. We will continue to do it. What may have looked like a pretty bold price on some previous acquisitions are now looking amazingly attractive in short periods of time. And PA is a great example, if you just \u2013 in less than a year, the whole multiple profile of our acquisition is amazingly attractive. I will just leave it like that. So, I think it's going to be a combination of going forward, that we will continue to invest in Jacobs and look at our stock buybacks. But from time-to-time, we are going to continue to build out this capability that we are really excited about. And \u2013 but it has to be a situation where we believe over the course of the first few years, we will all look back and say it was a very attractive price and not overpaying for something just because we got to get bigger. And that's \u2013 I think we have proven that in the past and we will continue to do that as we go forward. Okay. Thank you everyone. We look forward to hopefully having a good engagement during investor week with many of you. Take care."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Evans: Thank you, good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. Our 10-K will be filed later today. I would like to refer you to slide two of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda on slide three. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities, then summarizing highlights from our fourth quarter results. Claudia will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks and then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to our CEO, Bob Pragada.\nBob Pragada: Thanks, Jonathan. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 business performance and 2024 outlook. Our team has shown remarkable strength, adaptability, and dedication and continuing to deliver outstanding results to our clients. I'm proud of our people for continuing to drive our culture of carrying to new heights. Over the past couple of quarters, we have shared our intention to simplify our business model, optimize our cost structure, and accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion. Today marks a key turning point as we boldly move forward. I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business on slide four before I move on to our fourth quarter results. As we communicated, following a robust evaluation of all opportunities, we are excited to announce the creation of a new leading government services player. Jacobs will be separating our industry-leading Government Services businesses, Critical Mission Solutions, and the Cyber & Intelligence Unit of Divergent Solutions by the way of the spin-off to Jacobs' shareholders and then combining those assets with Amentum, through a merger which has been structured as a Reverse Morris Trust. This combination is intended to be largely tax-free for Jacobs shareholders. Turning to slide five. The combination creates a combined government technology services leader with an approximately $13 billion in revenue and approximately $1.1 billion of combined adjusted EBITDA, including $50 million to $70 million of net synergies expected to be realized by year two. Jacobs shareholders will own 51%, and Jacobs will retain a stake equal to between 7.5% to 12% of the combined company based on achievement of operating profit targets prior to close. Jacobs will also receive a $1 billion cash dividend, subject to customary adjustments, as well as an additional value through the disposition of our retained stake within 12 months of closing. As part of our continued separation efforts, we concluded it was the best, it was best to include the majority of our Divergent Solutions business including the Cyber & Intelligence unit in the separation perimeter, owing to the strategic synergies, shared costs, and operational overlap with CMS. We will retain the infrastructure-related software assets of Divergent Solutions, given their strong strategic fit with our Critical Infrastructure, Advanced Facilities, and PA Consulting businesses. We believe this combination of two premium industry leaders, who share strong operating platforms, high-performance culture, and a breadth of expertise offer shareholders the best opportunity to realize long-term value. The combined business has the ability to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful cost synergies, added scale, and diverse end-market exposure, and is supported by secular growth trends. After a comprehensive review of all inbound inquiries, we believe the transaction is in the best interest of the company and our stakeholders. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Jacobs Board, as well as the financial sponsors of Amentum and is not subject to any other shareholder approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the second-half of fiscal year 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. For more details regarding the structure of the deal, I invite you to review the materials we published earlier. Moving to slide six, which shows our multi-year transformation. As part of this strategic separation, which results in a more focused Jacobs, we are concurrently announcing a cost optimization plan to be executed over the next 24-months, during which time we will target over 300 basis points of margin expansion, as compared to our as reported fiscal year 2023 results driving an expected adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025 for pro-forma Jacobs. Claudia will share more details in here prepared remarks. Post transaction, Jacobs will be a well-capitalized pure play critical infrastructure and sustainability leader with a strong balance sheet and significant growth potential. Fiscal 2023 marked records for revenue and free cash flow generation for Jacobs, and we look forward to 2024 as we begin to chart our path forward as two leading independent companies. Turning to slide seven and Q4, I'm pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. I would like to once again reiterate that this growth is entirely organic. Strong cash conversion remains a hallmark of our business model and remain robust in Q4 allowing us to drive record fiscal year 2023 free cash flow in order to return capital to shareholders, while investing behind our growth accelerators, Climate Response, Data Solutions, and Consulting & Advisory. We recorded a 104% underlying free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income in FY 2023 on a record year of $837 million in free cash flow generation. We expect to generate greater than 100% underlying free cash flow conversion again in FY 2024, before the impact of restructuring transaction separation costs. Our underlying business and outlook remains very healthy and we continue to be excited about robust growth opportunities in all our end markets. Turning to slide eight, our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top-line growth with adjusted net revenue up 11% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit up 12% year-over-year. Claudia will provide further details on the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see widespread positive indicators with a gross profit in backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Once again, our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top-line, which provides visibility and confidence, and our expectations that growth can persist at mid-to-high single-digits organically in FY '24. Looking back at FY '23, I want to highlight the significant achievements of our P&PS business with double-digit organic OP growth in every quarter. Water continues to be a pillar of our business, of the top 30 wins in the quarter none were in the water sector. Of those wins, we wanted to highlight two that showcase our digital and data capabilities. Firstly, at the City of Farmington New Mexico wastewater and surface water treatment plant, our data-enabled product, AquaDNA is a key part of the solution to provide resiliency efforts and improve energy efficiency. Secondly, for Boston Water & Sewer Commission, we are leveraging our AI model that analyzes assets that are most likely to fail, helping our clients create data-driven maintenance and replacement plants. In the Energy Transition space, Jacobs has been selected as the Program Manager for thyssenkrupp $2.5 billion effort to decarbonize its steel mill in Duisburg Germany, with a new green hydrogen power plant. The site is Europe's largest steel mill and the effort represents one of the largest industrial decarbonization projects worldwide. It is also a testament to the diversity of our expertise. In Transportation, our largest market, we continue to see broad-based momentum from IIJA related funding. Overall, IIJA related pipeline has increased approximately 20% year-over-year. In Q4, we were selected to lead and manage the 10-year renovation of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport international terminal. Emphasizing upgrades enhanced mobility and energy efficiency to position Seattle as a global tourism and business hub. Internationally, we continue to see high levels of activity in the Middle East. For example, in Climate Response, we are providing program management services to the Saudi Arabia National Center for Environmental Compliance. The work forms part of their ongoing environmental remediation program to repair damage to terrestrial and coastal environments. Our environmental expertise is truly global, and we continue to see a robust opportunity set related to our clients\u2019 climate-related challenges. In CMS, we performed very well in Q4 to cap off a great year. CMS Q4 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year and operating profit increased 26% behind a 128 bps of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in FY 2024 and minimal forecasted recompete pursuits. CMS was awarded a new project management resources framework contract with EDF Nuclear generation, licensee of eight nuclear power stations, which account for approximately 16% of the U.K.'s electricity output. PA Consulting continues to post strong results with 13% revenue growth and nearly 21% operating profit margins, despite a very challenging macro environment. While we remain cognizant of the weakness that some consulting peers are seeing, we continue to be pleased with strong operational performance delivered by the PA team. Utilization has improved, and during Q4 PA announced the appointment of Christian Norris as its new CEO. Christian formerly led PA's Life Sciences unit as a respected leader both internally and externally and has creative idea to take the Jacobs partnership with PA to new heights. For example, the power of our relationship is driving further opportunities as evidenced in our recent award to the Copenhagen Metro framework. Together with PA, we are bringing our enterprise digital tools, AI solutions, and deep knowledge of the rail sector to support the Copenhagen Metro as it continues to deliver modern future-ready infrastructure to meet the city's fast-growing population and urban travel demand. Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 58% year-over-year growth in operating profit. In Divergent, we are a leader in space innovation, with the introduction of Mango Two, a revolutionary radio-frequency signal detection system that utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine-learning analytics emphasizing affordability. An example of the leading IP portfolio that reinforces independent CMS as a formidable player in this space arena. Turning to slide nine. In summary, we are extremely well-positioned for growth across all the sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record of operational excellence. We are excited to turn the page on this next chapter in Jacobs' history, where we will be creating two leading independent companies. Looking at Slide 10, independent Jacobs is a leader in the majority of sectors in which we operate and a global leader in the overall industry. With today's announcement, we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to further simplify our business structure, optimize our cost base, and accelerate growth and margin improvement in the quarters and years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Thank you, Bob. Turning to slide 11 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 10.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 8.9%. GAAP operating profit was $278 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, $43 million of other transaction separated-related and restructuring costs, and $11 million non-cash charge related to decreasing our real-estate footprint. The other transaction separation-related and restructuring cost of $43 million are primarily related to advisory and other costs associated with the separation of CMS. As we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the separation. Looking to fiscal year 2024, we expect to incur approximately $275 million in one-time costs related to the separation and associated cost optimization actions. These costs are largely unavoidable in a separation and transaction of this size, but I want to reiterate that post-separation, it will be a key focus of ours to minimize one-time adjustments inclusive of restructuring costs. Our adjusted operating margin was 11%, up 14 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.25 per share, and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.23 from transaction, restructuring, and other-related costs, a $0.05 non-cash impairment charge related to reducing our real-estate footprint, and a $0.10 adjustment to align to our annual adjusted effective tax rate. I refer you to slide 30 for more details on these adjustments. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.90, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $384 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing 11.1% of adjusted net revenue. The company's U.S. GAAP effective tax rate for continuing operations is 21% for the fiscal year 2023. Our U.S. GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter and year include certain tax charges for deferred tax valuation allowances and audit assessments. In the fourth quarter, this amounts to an EPS impact of $0.06 per share, and as a result, fiscal year 2023 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects a 21.6% adjusted effective tax rate. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1 times with our gross profit and backlog increasing 8% year-over-year. Moving to slide 12 for a brief recap of our full-year 2023 performance. Fiscal year gross revenue grew 10% year-over-year and net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion up significantly year-over-year, driven primarily by strong growth in gross profit while holding G&A relatively flat. GAAP EPS was $5.31 and adjusted EPS was $7.20, up 7% and 4% year-over-year, respectively. Adjusted operating profit grew 9%, and was up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Both revenue and adjusted operating profit increased year-over-year in all of our business segments. Operating profit margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.8%, driven by strong underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.44 billion, up 5% and up 7% in constant currency. As a percentage of adjusted net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%. We expect modest adjusted operating margin expansion in fiscal 2024, driven by a combination of a higher-margin revenue mix and lower corporate G&A. However, we expect an even greater uplift in margins post-separation as we streamline our operating model and cost structure. On a trailing 12-month basis, fiscal year 2023 book-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times. Regarding the performance of our lines of business let's turn to slide 13 for Q4 performance and 14 for full-year performance. Starting with People & Places Solutions. P&PS continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 adjusted net revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Growth was consistently strong across all business units. Europe rebounded positively after being our weakest region year-to-date and we saw continued strength in the Middle East, Americas, and Asia-Pacific. Backlog was relatively flat sequentially, although gross margin and backlog was up 8% year-over-year as we continue to focus on improving business quality. P&PS Q4 operating profit was up 12% driven by strong growth, maintaining healthy gross margins and solid G&A management resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 15%, up 16 basis points year-over-year. For the full-year, adjusted operating profit was up 16% and adjusted operating margins were 14.6%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. Our P&PS Americas unit, which is our largest by revenue benefited from legislative drivers and a healthy state and local budgets continuing to book client spending. Internationally, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East continued to be bright spots in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits. Additionally, our European business showed a positive sequential growth. Now moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Q4 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and backlog is up 8% year-over-year and the business continues to demonstrate a strong win rate against a very healthy pipeline in all of its core focus areas. CMS operating margins were up 128 basis points year-over-year. For the full-year, margins were roughly flat, while operating profit increased 6% year-over-year. Notably, margins continued to rebound throughout the year as forecasted. Moving to Divergent Solutions, adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q4, as we remain focused on portfolio improvement. We expect growth to accelerate from year-end levels as investments mature and lower-margin contracts roll out of backlog. Operating margins for the quarter was up 10.1% -- was 10.1%, a 50 basis point sequential improvement. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 13% year-over-year in Q4 and increased 4% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. Based on booking trends, we expect revenue growth to show a positive trend in fiscal year 2024 while remaining cautious of the macro risk as the U.K. goes through an election cycle. PA's Q4 operating profit was 20.6%, up 122 basis points year-over-year and up 21% year-over-year. Utilization continues to improve, and we expect operating margins to be over 20% for the medium term. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q4, roughly flat sequentially and consistent with our guidance. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model. However, despite initial cost actions taken, we will carry temporary costs associated with supporting the entirety of Jacobs, including the businesses to be separated. We estimate that we are carrying approximately $40 million in temporary cost throughout this transition period. This allows us the opportunity to reinforce our commitment to our clients and enhanced business resilience. We are confident that these efforts will contribute to a stronger foundation and continued excellence in serving our clients as two leading independent companies. Turning to slide 15 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings. Operating cash flow was $219 million and free cash flow was $180 million. As a result, we were able to deliver above our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the year with 104% underlying cash conversion. During fiscal year 2023, we returned 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders for a total of $480 million through both share repurchases and dividends. Though we were unable to repurchase shares in the quarter due to the CMS separation, we utilize cash flow to strategically pay down floating rate debt, ensuring a more robust financial position for the future. This disciplined approach aligns with our commitment to long-term financial stability and value creation for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with cash of $927 million and gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in just over $1.9 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile, both today and as a more focused business, post our announced CMS separation. In August, we completed the offering of $600 million in senior unsecured notes due 2028 with a fixed rate of 6.35%. This allowed us to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of the end of Q4, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail on our debt and quarterly interest expense. Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. On November 9, we paid a $0.26 dividend, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. Finally, I wanted to highlight our cost optimization plan shared on slide 16. We recognize that our cost structure is high. And we see opportunities to optimize in the coming quarters and post CMS separation. We have identified over $90 million in run rate savings, including lower corporate and allocated costs to the specific measures that we are starting to action. We expect to reduce our corporate unallocated costs from around $60 million per quarter to approximately $50 million per quarter, including full elimination of stranded costs post separation. We are streamlining our operating model with an eye towards positioning us for growth and cost efficiency, while staying focused on our clients. While we will not yet comment on long-term growth and margin expectations beyond our 2025 strategic plan, we believe we can deliver over 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from fiscal 2023 as reported margins to fiscal 2025 for standalone Jacobs. This results in an expected adjusted EBITDA margins for standalone Jacobs of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025. This is a bold undertaken as it is our longer-term aspiration to deliver best-in-class industry margins. In closing, Bob and I are committed to 3 things over the next few quarters. First, driving efficiencies in our business and maximizing our profitability as demonstrated by the margin targets. Second, position in our business with the financial resources needed for multiyear free cash flow growth. Third, strengthening discipline and deploying our shareholder capital. Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Claudia. Turning to slide 16. As we discussed throughout our remarks, we remain committed to accelerating robust growth opportunities ahead for all businesses. Given today's global macro uncertainty, that strength is more relevant than ever as we plan for the future as two independent companies. It's crucial to emphasize that the underlying fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Turning to fiscal year \u201824 outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.6 billion with an adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing a 9% and 10% and growth at the midpoint, respectively. This outlook incorporates the full-year contributions of the businesses to be separate. We expect a fiscal year \u201824 effective tax rate of 22%. As Claudia previously mentioned, we will carry temporarily elevated overhead costs needed to support CMS during the separation, including IT and corporate support. This, coupled with a historical seasonality, will have an approximately 10% negative effect year-over-year on adjusted EPS in Q1. We believe these costs are necessary to continue to support our clients as we progress through this transition period. This temporary cost is non-recurring and shall not be viewed as a reflection of a stand-alone company earnings power. We are well positioned to accelerate profitable growth in the years to come as we seek to compound per share value for our shareholders. We continue to be energized and excited about the future for Jacobs and CMS, and remain confident in our plan for long-term value creation. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone and congratulations on all the strong work here. Can I just ask in terms of the margin expansion targets. Can we just flesh that out a little bit and just talk a little bit more about the timing, how back-end loaded is that '24 versus '25, and if we just unpack the pieces a little bit more in terms of just the buckets of the 300 basis points relative sizes, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Hi, Jerry, so I would like to -- you have some of the details on this slide. And so let me just go over the details of this slide. So you have first a component of the stranded cost. So that one will happen after the separation. So that's roughly $50 million that you see there. So then you have one that we started to taking action, which is really the operating model, and that will obviously accelerate after the separation, but we've already taken action on that. So you'll see some of that over time in \u201824 and accelerated after the separation. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you have the overhead or the unallocated corporate that we normally see -- you normally see it as a separate line. And I talked about the $60 million down to $50 million. We will carry some temporary costs to support CMS as we prepare it for the independent company or the combined company. And that one as well, you'll accelerate in 2025. So in summary, you'll see a little bit in '24 accelerating after the separation. If I want to give you the nature of what is that, is really the -- a lot of the support is IT, the support layers and just in general, a simpler management structure and support.\nJerry Revich: Okay, super. And then the core underlying People & Places cadence that's better than that. Can you just expand on how that looks versus what you folks laid out to us in the 2025 plan? How -- what's progressing faster or slower than expectations relative to the segment margin ramp that you laid out just over a year ago?\nBob Pragada: Yes. What we laid out over a year ago, Jerry, continues. With regards to the P&PS margin expectations in that strategic time period, that hasn't changed.\nJerry Revich: Okay, thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Chad, your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to continue on the margin question. I was hoping you could bridge the 300 basis points, how much comes from CMS? How much comes from, I guess, the decision to include Divergent Solutions the cost out? And is there anything else that we should be thinking about when bridging today versus 2025?\nClaudia Jaramillo: So Chad, the 13.8% is the stand-alone Jacobs, so it excludes CMS and Cyber & Intelligence. And then the nature of those costs is the three buckets that I mentioned before, which are really corporate unlocated going from the $60 million run rate to $50 million run rate post separation, and then the operating model, which is $50 million in total run rate and then full elimination of stranded costs up to the separation.\nBob Pragada: Chad, if you were to take it in two buckets, Chad -- if you're taking two buckets, half is coming from the operating model of a cost structure that's more in line with the type of business that we will have and half is coming from margin expansion and margin mix. It's a higher margin, higher growth business. So think about it simplistically that way.\nChad Dillard: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a question for you on backlog growth. I appreciate that gross margin in backlog is growing by 8%. But I was hoping maybe you could frame backlog growth, excluding the capacity revenues. Just really trying to understand what were some of the puts versus the takes, strength versus weakness that you're seeing underlying in People & Places? And then maybe you can talk about just the size of the pipeline.\nBob Pragada: Yes. I don't actually think, Chad, it's a weakness. Actually, I think it's really strong in our P&PS business right now. It's really on project life cycle. We measure that revenue growth based on where we are in the project life cycle, right? And so when we're deep into whether it be advanced facilities jobs or large infrastructure programs, we're going to be burning and booking and burning a lot higher revenue kind of models. But as our business continues to profile more into a consultancy world, we're executing higher value services over the project and program life cycle. So you'll have lower revenue, higher margin opportunities come into backlog, and it just depends on when that program life cycle is. So we've talked about it before, which one is accelerating at a faster rate. I'd kind of tie that to where are we in the cycle of some of the spends.\nChad Dillard: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Micheal, your line is open.\nMichael Dudas: Hi, good morning, Claudia.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Good morning.\nBob Pragada: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Bob, maybe you could share maybe a touch of the pipeline of backlog. As you're entering 2024 in P&PS, you touched on water in your prepared remarks. What are some of the other areas that you see some interesting opportunities for new project backlog growth? And how much of -- you mentioned about the change in mix of the type of service that you're going to be providing to your client base. How quickly or how noticeable will that be maybe on the project management consultancy side as we run through the revenue model over the next maybe two to three years?\nBob Pragada: So two parts. One, Mike, you're asking about kind of what are some of the other end market secular trends that we're seeing? And then the second part of the question is around how do we see kind of revenue models as our consultancy business continues to grow -- consultancy type business. Is that fair?\nMichael Dudas: Yes, to drive that, the better mix that you're talking about over your\u2026\nBob Pragada: Sure, sure. The other verticals, I mentioned of our top 30 wins, nine are in water. If you take water and advanced facilities, it's -- half of the top 31s were in both of those sectors, six big advanced facilities markets, too. So we continue to see strong activity within the advanced facilities world, probably driven more so now as we bottomed out from an end market standpoint as far as sales goes within the semiconductor industry. Keep in mind, our clients continue to spend through there. But now with the GLP-1 drugs going on in life sciences and all the strength that we see with our clients we've had for years, advanced facilities is going to continue to be strong. And then the others, I'd highlight is energy transition. I highlighted a specific job, but the whole grid modernization of everything that we're seeing, and we're kind of in that consultancy component of that, and that's a strong piece, which is a segue to the second part. I would say that, that continued profile of our portfolio within now, call it, independent Jacobs, is we're kind of in the early innings of that. And so it's going to be a balance. But I'd say over the course of the next two or three, four years, it's going to drive that margin expansion even beyond what Claudia talked about post '25 with a cash conversion component to that that's very high.\nMichael Dudas: Perfect, I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy, your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone, again.\nBob Pragada: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So just sorting through Q4 results, I know there's a lot of noise because of the announced deal, but EPS and upcoming in below the low end of your previous guidance, could you give us more color into what exactly happened in the quarter that was below your expectations? And you mentioned the $40 million of temporary costs that you're carrying and how that's impacting your results. Should we simply be adding that $40 million back to your $1.53 billion to $1.6 billion EBITDA for '24 to get what guidance would have been if you weren't doing the RMT?\nClaudia Jaramillo: Yes. So Andy, so let's start with the first one, which is the big one and explains roughly half of the gap is the tax piece. And I had -- I included some of them in my remarks. So if I take, it's $0.06, so it's more the -- when you have a one-off allowance, and this is something that happens with your deferred tax. And -- so then the next one is going to be basically overhead costs or unallocated is one, we call it corporate unallocated. That's the other big piece. And then the share count, and I mentioned why we could do stock repurchases in the fourth quarter given -- based on the transaction. So that's at a high level what that means. Then I added some of the commentary that is on the temporary cost that we're carrying as we prepare CMS and the Cyber & Intelligence unit to operate independently. So that's the other piece of the puzzle, if you want.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Claudia, is it right to say that you could -- again, if you weren't doing the RMT, you would add that $40 million debt to EBITDA? Or is that not right to think like that?\nClaudia Jaramillo: Absolutely. And that's what Bob mentioned that towards the end, that's really our earnings power should exclude that -- those temporary costs. We're very client-centric. It's our clients' mission, and we want to make sure we have quite a bit of value tied to this transaction and the upside that we included in this additional value that we're going to get in the transaction and the new entity. We won the two entities to be very successful. It's temporary. And is to make sure we're preparing to have a very leader that we want and that we continue to be.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Great, and then Bob\u2026\nBob Pragada: So Andy just to clarify. So the EBITDA guidance that I gave at the end we're carrying it in that guidance.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Yes, that's clear. And then, Bob, just P&PS, net revenue up 11% year I think you said you have good confidence in mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth. Could you elaborate on the confidence do you see P&PS backlog growing at that rate in FY '24? And then how are you thinking about the balance between higher interest rates impacting projects and geopolitical risks with all the fiscal stimulus, that you mentioned and so on.\nBob Pragada: Yes. I think on the backlog piece of the question, Andy, my answer is yes, I think that mid- to high single-digit growth will continue. Remember, we've got a really nice diversity within P&PS. So if we think about some of the political risk or what's happening with interest rates, which might be affecting some of our private sector clients, there's not a full immunity, but our private sector clients continue to spend just because of the -- whether they be technology-based or global supply chain based, I say technology-based science-based drivers or supply chain drivers that has continued, and that's really been driving the performance. As far as IIJA or a larger infrastructure around energy transition outside the U.S., we have not seen that effect. In fact, our pipeline continues to grow at mid to high-single-digit percentages, and this is on a base that's very high.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning Bob and Claudia. Thank you for the time.\nBob Pragada: Hey, Bert.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Hi.\nBert Subin: Bob maybe just taking that, I think that was more of a backlog question. You said in your prepared remarks, the outlook remains very healthy. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about the organic growth profile for the company in this coming year? Just for Remainco, you think the previous range for FY '24 for P&PS was a 6% to 9% organic CAGR, with PA Consulting at 12% to 15%, do those remain intact? And on the advanced facility side, pretty positive comments there. Do you think that can keep growing double digits?\nBob Pragada: Yes. So the first part of the question, Bert, my answer is yes. I think on advanced facilities, I would say the underlying growth is strong. A lot of these larger programs, whether they be in the semiconductor space or in the life sciences space, are -- there are several, in fact, from an account standpoint, it's probably the highest that it's been. It continues to stay at a very high level. We're seeing now kind of the next wave of -- I mentioned GLP-1, but also other novel therapies run, oncology and some of the neuroscience projects that we're seeing. So the numbers will stay -- as far as numbers of opportunities will stay high. Where they are in the project life cycle will kind of balance -- imagine there's two curves. One is kind of coming down as far as the way that we saw. The others coming up, which kind of leads to a 12 to 13 -- I'm sorry, 12 to 18 month kind of reset there. Gather everything that I just said, your numbers work.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. And maybe just a level deeper into the P&PS side. You mentioned some positive remarks on water and on international opportunities. Can you just sort of give us the viewpoint on how you're thinking about, I guess, the regional disparity in FY '24? As FX starts to become less of a factor, do you think what you're seeing in Europe and other parts of the world can rival sort of the growth we're expecting from IIJA in the U.S.?\nBob Pragada: I don't know if it will get to that level. But I think it will be robust. And I think Claudia mentioned it, our European business, despite these macro headwinds that it faced has done well. And so I think water transportation, energy transition that's driving the U.S., probably more pronounced around energy transition in Europe. Middle East is across all of our sectors -- P&PS sectors in the Middle East. And then in Southeast Asia and Australia and New Zealand, those have remained strong. Our business in APAC this year grew at significant double digits. And so a smaller base in the rest of the world. So I'd say all in all, the geographic diversity that we have in our business really, really is strong and helps us.\nBert Subin: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven, your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the mix element of the 300 basis point margin bridge. I think, Bob, when you were talking about the half before that's mix, like how much of that is related to just not having the lower margin in CMS in there versus achieving better margins in P&PS? I guess I'm wondering when all is said and done with your cost optimization, will your segment-level margins be better? Or will that come out of some other initiatives over time?\nClaudia Jaramillo: Yes. So Steven, let me just make sure I understand. So I'll recap what Bob said, and then I'll address the segment margins. So the first one is the going up to 13.8%, roughly half is just the mix. And by mix, I mean, just what remains with us. The other half is the cost optimization, the streamlining of the operating model. And that is really a function of the remaining businesses removing costs and also the addition of our digital enablement and all that. So that and other works, the segments remain with us or the businesses that stay with us are going to increase their individual margins. Does that answer your question?\nSteven Fisher: Yes, it does. So as part of the cost optimization, there is segment level efficiency initiatives as opposed to just sort of the corporate level element. Yes, that's helpful.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Both operations that's what the operating model, that's where it shows overall as a company. Yes.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. Great. And just trying to think about your debt position in about 12 months from now. I'm not sure if I missed if you frame this out or not, but $1.9 billion of net debt now, $1 billion of dividend coming back from the separation to pay down debt. Free cash flow looks like it would be about another $1 billion before whatever cash restructuring expenses you're calling out. I don't know how much that is. But are you assuming close to sort of a net cash position exiting 2024?\nClaudia Jaramillo: Yes. So all our decisions are guided by a few principles. The first one is maintaining an investment-grade rating. Very important for us to maintain the strategic flexibility that we want. So those decisions are guided by our conversations with the rating agencies, especially with this transaction. And the other one is our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. So as we go to the transaction, I think one of the elements is also the element of distribution to our shareholders, and that's one of the reasons I highlighted so much we returned this quarter -- this year, and that is an important guiding principle for us is on a risk-adjusted basis to make the best decisions for our shareholders. And so I think that's an important element in the equation.\nSteven Fisher: Thank you very much.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBob Pragada: Hey, Gautam. Good morning.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Hi, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could characterize the risk profile, some of the projects you've been booking in the backlog given the margins seem to be higher. Are these mostly fixed cost, what allows the profits to be higher? Just the mix of fixed price? Is there any more -- just how would you characterize. Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Yes. No, Gautam, it's a great question because it's where we're playing within the client business. I mean we're talking about a level of scientific and technical offering that is at the highest part of the business of our clients' business. And so whether it be in our pure-play PA Consulting work or in our science-based technical offering in the infrastructure and advanced facility space, that garners a higher level commercial model, part one. Part two is around the digital enablement, right? We're actually offering outcome-based solutions rather than the historical, I'm going to get margin from a commercial model that's either fixed or reimbursable and trade on a productivity gain. We're able to get those types of margins with -- we'll get them in a reimbursable scenario or we'll get them in a fixed-price services scenario just because of the level of impact that we're having in our clients' business.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And just one quick follow-up. You guys have talked about your PFAS technology. I was just curious if you've had any commercial traction yet? And if not, when do you anticipate booking some of that PFAS-related work?\nBob Pragada: Yes, it has. It has in the PFAS work, to segregate it out as an end market, we haven't. Where we're seeing the PFAS gain is in our water center. These wins that I'm referencing as well as some of the larger framework agreements that we have for water clients, whether they be federal, state or local around the world, that comes into play. We're actually making PFAS type of consultancy arrangements around that, too. The real PFAS for PFAS sake across the industry comes when you get type of super fund type of application in these containments being highlighted on public dockets. So we're -- we see growth, but I would look at that growth probably from a perspective of how it affects our end market sectors. And then when you get kind of in the 25%, 26%, 27% range and you start to get some compliance related items that are even further driving those end market sectors it gets bigger.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSabahat Khan: Great, thanks and good morning. I guess I just want to get a little bit of perspective on maybe just the medium term even if it's directionally. As you look at the 13.8% in fiscal \u201825, and maybe just think about your mix by end market and region. If we just think moving on from that, is there opportunity whether to maybe look within P&PS for maybe lower margin businesses? Or where you expand geographically? I'm just thinking about the levers kind of going forward you see for the P&PS margins beyond just cost optimization to sort of get to that level in a few years?\nBob Pragada: Okay, you go ahead.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Yes. So I'd say this is something that we do -- we're doing currently, and we do all the time. So I would say two big levers are the -- our global delivery platform is one, very important, and we have one of the best platforms, if not the best, and it's been for several years. That's the first one. The other one is the digital enablement. And you see at some of the projects that we highlighted today are you see a clear differentiation that we have compared to our competitors, where we -- the digital enablement and the outcome based that Bob mentioned before, drives those more profitable projects.\nBob Pragada: Yes. And just to add one more thing, Sabahat, on the kind of the -- what we need. We don't -- we feel really strongly that our portfolio in the end markets that we're in is strong. Claudia talked about our two biggest enablers. I'll add a third, which is our consultancy enablement as well. But it's not like we need to go search for new geographies or buy skill sets in an end market sector. It's really the expansion through the digital and consultancy-based enablement, coupled with access to global talent, which -- I'll be in high agreements that we're one of the best in how we deliver on that.\nSabahat Khan: Okay. Great. And then as you think about your guidance for kind of next year, kind of the numbers embedded in your three-year plan, you laid out the 6% to 9% for P&PS. And even as you look out sort of maybe another year beyond that, what mix of price versus volume do you anticipate given some of the funding that's in the system right now? And how should we think about that mix over the next couple of years, particularly in the kind of infra space?\nBob Pragada: Yes. I think that that's going to be tied to this enablement component. It's not -- this is honed in because it's kind of a different -- probably a different answer for different components of that infrastructure in advanced facility space, but this is honed in on infrastructure. Our clients are capped with how much they can spend for the infrastructure needs. So what we do is we come in with an offering where we're gaining margin with the enablement of outcomes-based solutions. So there's a price component that -- but with a higher margin what we're driving with our digital enablement. So we see that driving to the bottom line as we do all the things that Claudia talked about is creating a more simplified and streamlined organization.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy your line is open.\nAndy Wittmann: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess it would just be kind of helpful to understand the timing on the $275 million of costs associated with all these actions. It sounds like there's going to be some here ahead of the transaction, but some probably translate to after the transaction. Claudia, can you just talk about the timing of those cash items and recognition of those on the income statement?\nClaudia Jaramillo: So Andy, this is very closely linked to the execution of the separation. So there will be more towards the end, you will have more because of elimination of -- we talked about the stranded costs and the advisers and all that, but very much throughout if you're going to see it because of the advisory fees and all that I mentioned before. So that's just aligned with the time line of the separation.\nAndy Wittmann: Okay. And then I guess -- I don't to do next. I guess I guess on the 1Q guide, I guess I just want to get a little bit more comfortable with that. I don't think you're saying that the corporate unallocated cost run rate is going to be higher in 1Q. It sounds like you're saying it's going to be about the same. I just wanted to confirm that. Then when you talk about the seasonality, I guess, there's always seasonality in 1Q. What's different about this year's seasonality? Is it just the fact that the items that were called out in last year's footnote that present a tough comp that weren't excluded? And I guess maybe related to that, if there are costs that are related to restructuring and separation, why aren't those being excluded in the first quarter?\nClaudia Jaramillo: No, I think we talked about -- well, there is a seasonality of the business. So yes, I'd say yes to that one. And then the ones that I mentioned of the $40 million, just at a high level, the cost that we're carrying to support the separation of CMS. So it's really linked to the transaction or the preparing CMS to operate in the new environment. So those, I would say -- that one amplifies the impact. But I didn't say it would be higher on the $60 million is more what we carry in extra throughout or across the company to support CMS. CMS and Cyber & Intelligence.\nAndy Wittmann: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no more questions. And now I would like to turn the call back over to the team.\nBob Pragada: Yes. Thank you, everyone. We're excited about the future, and we look forward to providing more updates as we progress our exciting plan forward. Thank you, everyone.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thanks, Jonathan. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 business performance and 2024 outlook. Our team has shown remarkable strength, adaptability, and dedication and continuing to deliver outstanding results to our clients. I'm proud of our people for continuing to drive our culture of carrying to new heights. Over the past couple of quarters, we have shared our intention to simplify our business model, optimize our cost structure, and accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion. Today marks a key turning point as we boldly move forward. I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business on slide four before I move on to our fourth quarter results. As we communicated, following a robust evaluation of all opportunities, we are excited to announce the creation of a new leading government services player. Jacobs will be separating our industry-leading Government Services businesses, Critical Mission Solutions, and the Cyber & Intelligence Unit of Divergent Solutions by the way of the spin-off to Jacobs' shareholders and then combining those assets with Amentum, through a merger which has been structured as a Reverse Morris Trust. This combination is intended to be largely tax-free for Jacobs shareholders. Turning to slide five. The combination creates a combined government technology services leader with an approximately $13 billion in revenue and approximately $1.1 billion of combined adjusted EBITDA, including $50 million to $70 million of net synergies expected to be realized by year two. Jacobs shareholders will own 51%, and Jacobs will retain a stake equal to between 7.5% to 12% of the combined company based on achievement of operating profit targets prior to close. Jacobs will also receive a $1 billion cash dividend, subject to customary adjustments, as well as an additional value through the disposition of our retained stake within 12 months of closing. As part of our continued separation efforts, we concluded it was the best, it was best to include the majority of our Divergent Solutions business including the Cyber & Intelligence unit in the separation perimeter, owing to the strategic synergies, shared costs, and operational overlap with CMS. We will retain the infrastructure-related software assets of Divergent Solutions, given their strong strategic fit with our Critical Infrastructure, Advanced Facilities, and PA Consulting businesses. We believe this combination of two premium industry leaders, who share strong operating platforms, high-performance culture, and a breadth of expertise offer shareholders the best opportunity to realize long-term value. The combined business has the ability to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful cost synergies, added scale, and diverse end-market exposure, and is supported by secular growth trends. After a comprehensive review of all inbound inquiries, we believe the transaction is in the best interest of the company and our stakeholders. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Jacobs Board, as well as the financial sponsors of Amentum and is not subject to any other shareholder approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the second-half of fiscal year 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. For more details regarding the structure of the deal, I invite you to review the materials we published earlier. Moving to slide six, which shows our multi-year transformation. As part of this strategic separation, which results in a more focused Jacobs, we are concurrently announcing a cost optimization plan to be executed over the next 24-months, during which time we will target over 300 basis points of margin expansion, as compared to our as reported fiscal year 2023 results driving an expected adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025 for pro-forma Jacobs. Claudia will share more details in here prepared remarks. Post transaction, Jacobs will be a well-capitalized pure play critical infrastructure and sustainability leader with a strong balance sheet and significant growth potential. Fiscal 2023 marked records for revenue and free cash flow generation for Jacobs, and we look forward to 2024 as we begin to chart our path forward as two leading independent companies. Turning to slide seven and Q4, I'm pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. I would like to once again reiterate that this growth is entirely organic. Strong cash conversion remains a hallmark of our business model and remain robust in Q4 allowing us to drive record fiscal year 2023 free cash flow in order to return capital to shareholders, while investing behind our growth accelerators, Climate Response, Data Solutions, and Consulting & Advisory. We recorded a 104% underlying free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income in FY 2023 on a record year of $837 million in free cash flow generation. We expect to generate greater than 100% underlying free cash flow conversion again in FY 2024, before the impact of restructuring transaction separation costs. Our underlying business and outlook remains very healthy and we continue to be excited about robust growth opportunities in all our end markets. Turning to slide eight, our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top-line growth with adjusted net revenue up 11% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit up 12% year-over-year. Claudia will provide further details on the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see widespread positive indicators with a gross profit in backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Once again, our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top-line, which provides visibility and confidence, and our expectations that growth can persist at mid-to-high single-digits organically in FY '24. Looking back at FY '23, I want to highlight the significant achievements of our P&PS business with double-digit organic OP growth in every quarter. Water continues to be a pillar of our business, of the top 30 wins in the quarter none were in the water sector. Of those wins, we wanted to highlight two that showcase our digital and data capabilities. Firstly, at the City of Farmington New Mexico wastewater and surface water treatment plant, our data-enabled product, AquaDNA is a key part of the solution to provide resiliency efforts and improve energy efficiency. Secondly, for Boston Water & Sewer Commission, we are leveraging our AI model that analyzes assets that are most likely to fail, helping our clients create data-driven maintenance and replacement plants. In the Energy Transition space, Jacobs has been selected as the Program Manager for thyssenkrupp $2.5 billion effort to decarbonize its steel mill in Duisburg Germany, with a new green hydrogen power plant. The site is Europe's largest steel mill and the effort represents one of the largest industrial decarbonization projects worldwide. It is also a testament to the diversity of our expertise. In Transportation, our largest market, we continue to see broad-based momentum from IIJA related funding. Overall, IIJA related pipeline has increased approximately 20% year-over-year. In Q4, we were selected to lead and manage the 10-year renovation of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport international terminal. Emphasizing upgrades enhanced mobility and energy efficiency to position Seattle as a global tourism and business hub. Internationally, we continue to see high levels of activity in the Middle East. For example, in Climate Response, we are providing program management services to the Saudi Arabia National Center for Environmental Compliance. The work forms part of their ongoing environmental remediation program to repair damage to terrestrial and coastal environments. Our environmental expertise is truly global, and we continue to see a robust opportunity set related to our clients' climate-related challenges. In CMS, we performed very well in Q4 to cap off a great year. CMS Q4 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year and operating profit increased 26% behind a 128 bps of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in FY 2024 and minimal forecasted recompete pursuits. CMS was awarded a new project management resources framework contract with EDF Nuclear generation, licensee of eight nuclear power stations, which account for approximately 16% of the U.K.'s electricity output. PA Consulting continues to post strong results with 13% revenue growth and nearly 21% operating profit margins, despite a very challenging macro environment. While we remain cognizant of the weakness that some consulting peers are seeing, we continue to be pleased with strong operational performance delivered by the PA team. Utilization has improved, and during Q4 PA announced the appointment of Christian Norris as its new CEO. Christian formerly led PA's Life Sciences unit as a respected leader both internally and externally and has creative idea to take the Jacobs partnership with PA to new heights. For example, the power of our relationship is driving further opportunities as evidenced in our recent award to the Copenhagen Metro framework. Together with PA, we are bringing our enterprise digital tools, AI solutions, and deep knowledge of the rail sector to support the Copenhagen Metro as it continues to deliver modern future-ready infrastructure to meet the city's fast-growing population and urban travel demand. Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 58% year-over-year growth in operating profit. In Divergent, we are a leader in space innovation, with the introduction of Mango Two, a revolutionary radio-frequency signal detection system that utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine-learning analytics emphasizing affordability. An example of the leading IP portfolio that reinforces independent CMS as a formidable player in this space arena. Turning to slide nine. In summary, we are extremely well-positioned for growth across all the sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record of operational excellence. We are excited to turn the page on this next chapter in Jacobs' history, where we will be creating two leading independent companies. Looking at Slide 10, independent Jacobs is a leader in the majority of sectors in which we operate and a global leader in the overall industry. With today's announcement, we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to further simplify our business structure, optimize our cost base, and accelerate growth and margin improvement in the quarters and years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Claudia. Turning to slide 16. As we discussed throughout our remarks, we remain committed to accelerating robust growth opportunities ahead for all businesses. Given today's global macro uncertainty, that strength is more relevant than ever as we plan for the future as two independent companies. It's crucial to emphasize that the underlying fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Turning to fiscal year \u201824 outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.6 billion with an adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing a 9% and 10% and growth at the midpoint, respectively. This outlook incorporates the full-year contributions of the businesses to be separate. We expect a fiscal year \u201824 effective tax rate of 22%. As Claudia previously mentioned, we will carry temporarily elevated overhead costs needed to support CMS during the separation, including IT and corporate support. This, coupled with a historical seasonality, will have an approximately 10% negative effect year-over-year on adjusted EPS in Q1. We believe these costs are necessary to continue to support our clients as we progress through this transition period. This temporary cost is non-recurring and shall not be viewed as a reflection of a stand-alone company earnings power. We are well positioned to accelerate profitable growth in the years to come as we seek to compound per share value for our shareholders. We continue to be energized and excited about the future for Jacobs and CMS, and remain confident in our plan for long-term value creation. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Yes. What we laid out over a year ago, Jerry, continues. With regards to the P&PS margin expectations in that strategic time period, that hasn't changed. Chad, if you were to take it in two buckets, Chad -- if you're taking two buckets, half is coming from the operating model of a cost structure that's more in line with the type of business that we will have and half is coming from margin expansion and margin mix. It's a higher margin, higher growth business. So think about it simplistically that way. Yes. I don't actually think, Chad, it's a weakness. Actually, I think it's really strong in our P&PS business right now. It's really on project life cycle. We measure that revenue growth based on where we are in the project life cycle, right? And so when we're deep into whether it be advanced facilities jobs or large infrastructure programs, we're going to be burning and booking and burning a lot higher revenue kind of models. But as our business continues to profile more into a consultancy world, we're executing higher value services over the project and program life cycle. So you'll have lower revenue, higher margin opportunities come into backlog, and it just depends on when that program life cycle is. So we've talked about it before, which one is accelerating at a faster rate. I'd kind of tie that to where are we in the cycle of some of the spends. Good morning, Mike. So two parts. One, Mike, you're asking about kind of what are some of the other end market secular trends that we're seeing? And then the second part of the question is around how do we see kind of revenue models as our consultancy business continues to grow -- consultancy type business. Is that fair? Sure, sure. The other verticals, I mentioned of our top 30 wins, nine are in water. If you take water and advanced facilities, it's -- half of the top 31s were in both of those sectors, six big advanced facilities markets, too. So we continue to see strong activity within the advanced facilities world, probably driven more so now as we bottomed out from an end market standpoint as far as sales goes within the semiconductor industry. Keep in mind, our clients continue to spend through there. But now with the GLP-1 drugs going on in life sciences and all the strength that we see with our clients we've had for years, advanced facilities is going to continue to be strong. And then the others, I'd highlight is energy transition. I highlighted a specific job, but the whole grid modernization of everything that we're seeing, and we're kind of in that consultancy component of that, and that's a strong piece, which is a segue to the second part. I would say that, that continued profile of our portfolio within now, call it, independent Jacobs, is we're kind of in the early innings of that. And so it's going to be a balance. But I'd say over the course of the next two or three, four years, it's going to drive that margin expansion even beyond what Claudia talked about post '25 with a cash conversion component to that that's very high. Good morning, Andy. So Andy just to clarify. So the EBITDA guidance that I gave at the end we're carrying it in that guidance. Yes. I think on the backlog piece of the question, Andy, my answer is yes, I think that mid- to high single-digit growth will continue. Remember, we've got a really nice diversity within P&PS. So if we think about some of the political risk or what's happening with interest rates, which might be affecting some of our private sector clients, there's not a full immunity, but our private sector clients continue to spend just because of the -- whether they be technology-based or global supply chain based, I say technology-based science-based drivers or supply chain drivers that has continued, and that's really been driving the performance. As far as IIJA or a larger infrastructure around energy transition outside the U.S., we have not seen that effect. In fact, our pipeline continues to grow at mid to high-single-digit percentages, and this is on a base that's very high. Hey, Bert. Yes. So the first part of the question, Bert, my answer is yes. I think on advanced facilities, I would say the underlying growth is strong. A lot of these larger programs, whether they be in the semiconductor space or in the life sciences space, are -- there are several, in fact, from an account standpoint, it's probably the highest that it's been. It continues to stay at a very high level. We're seeing now kind of the next wave of -- I mentioned GLP-1, but also other novel therapies run, oncology and some of the neuroscience projects that we're seeing. So the numbers will stay -- as far as numbers of opportunities will stay high. Where they are in the project life cycle will kind of balance -- imagine there's two curves. One is kind of coming down as far as the way that we saw. The others coming up, which kind of leads to a 12 to 13 -- I'm sorry, 12 to 18 month kind of reset there. Gather everything that I just said, your numbers work. I don't know if it will get to that level. But I think it will be robust. And I think Claudia mentioned it, our European business, despite these macro headwinds that it faced has done well. And so I think water transportation, energy transition that's driving the U.S., probably more pronounced around energy transition in Europe. Middle East is across all of our sectors -- P&PS sectors in the Middle East. And then in Southeast Asia and Australia and New Zealand, those have remained strong. Our business in APAC this year grew at significant double digits. And so a smaller base in the rest of the world. So I'd say all in all, the geographic diversity that we have in our business really, really is strong and helps us. Hey, Gautam. Good morning. Yes. No, Gautam, it's a great question because it's where we're playing within the client business. I mean we're talking about a level of scientific and technical offering that is at the highest part of the business of our clients' business. And so whether it be in our pure-play PA Consulting work or in our science-based technical offering in the infrastructure and advanced facility space, that garners a higher level commercial model, part one. Part two is around the digital enablement, right? We're actually offering outcome-based solutions rather than the historical, I'm going to get margin from a commercial model that's either fixed or reimbursable and trade on a productivity gain. We're able to get those types of margins with -- we'll get them in a reimbursable scenario or we'll get them in a fixed-price services scenario just because of the level of impact that we're having in our clients' business. Yes, it has. It has in the PFAS work, to segregate it out as an end market, we haven't. Where we're seeing the PFAS gain is in our water center. These wins that I'm referencing as well as some of the larger framework agreements that we have for water clients, whether they be federal, state or local around the world, that comes into play. We're actually making PFAS type of consultancy arrangements around that, too. The real PFAS for PFAS sake across the industry comes when you get type of super fund type of application in these containments being highlighted on public dockets. So we're -- we see growth, but I would look at that growth probably from a perspective of how it affects our end market sectors. And then when you get kind of in the 25%, 26%, 27% range and you start to get some compliance related items that are even further driving those end market sectors it gets bigger. Okay, you go ahead. Yes. And just to add one more thing, Sabahat, on the kind of the -- what we need. We don't -- we feel really strongly that our portfolio in the end markets that we're in is strong. Claudia talked about our two biggest enablers. I'll add a third, which is our consultancy enablement as well. But it's not like we need to go search for new geographies or buy skill sets in an end market sector. It's really the expansion through the digital and consultancy-based enablement, coupled with access to global talent, which -- I'll be in high agreements that we're one of the best in how we deliver on that. Yes. I think that that's going to be tied to this enablement component. It's not -- this is honed in because it's kind of a different -- probably a different answer for different components of that infrastructure in advanced facility space, but this is honed in on infrastructure. Our clients are capped with how much they can spend for the infrastructure needs. So what we do is we come in with an offering where we're gaining margin with the enablement of outcomes-based solutions. So there's a price component that -- but with a higher margin what we're driving with our digital enablement. So we see that driving to the bottom line as we do all the things that Claudia talked about is creating a more simplified and streamlined organization. Yes. Thank you, everyone. We're excited about the future, and we look forward to providing more updates as we progress our exciting plan forward. Thank you, everyone."

            "name": "Claudia Jaramillo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Turning to slide 11 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 10.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 8.9%. GAAP operating profit was $278 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, $43 million of other transaction separated-related and restructuring costs, and $11 million non-cash charge related to decreasing our real-estate footprint. The other transaction separation-related and restructuring cost of $43 million are primarily related to advisory and other costs associated with the separation of CMS. As we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the separation. Looking to fiscal year 2024, we expect to incur approximately $275 million in one-time costs related to the separation and associated cost optimization actions. These costs are largely unavoidable in a separation and transaction of this size, but I want to reiterate that post-separation, it will be a key focus of ours to minimize one-time adjustments inclusive of restructuring costs. Our adjusted operating margin was 11%, up 14 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.25 per share, and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.23 from transaction, restructuring, and other-related costs, a $0.05 non-cash impairment charge related to reducing our real-estate footprint, and a $0.10 adjustment to align to our annual adjusted effective tax rate. I refer you to slide 30 for more details on these adjustments. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.90, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $384 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing 11.1% of adjusted net revenue. The company's U.S. GAAP effective tax rate for continuing operations is 21% for the fiscal year 2023. Our U.S. GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter and year include certain tax charges for deferred tax valuation allowances and audit assessments. In the fourth quarter, this amounts to an EPS impact of $0.06 per share, and as a result, fiscal year 2023 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects a 21.6% adjusted effective tax rate. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1 times with our gross profit and backlog increasing 8% year-over-year. Moving to slide 12 for a brief recap of our full-year 2023 performance. Fiscal year gross revenue grew 10% year-over-year and net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion up significantly year-over-year, driven primarily by strong growth in gross profit while holding G&A relatively flat. GAAP EPS was $5.31 and adjusted EPS was $7.20, up 7% and 4% year-over-year, respectively. Adjusted operating profit grew 9%, and was up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Both revenue and adjusted operating profit increased year-over-year in all of our business segments. Operating profit margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.8%, driven by strong underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.44 billion, up 5% and up 7% in constant currency. As a percentage of adjusted net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%. We expect modest adjusted operating margin expansion in fiscal 2024, driven by a combination of a higher-margin revenue mix and lower corporate G&A. However, we expect an even greater uplift in margins post-separation as we streamline our operating model and cost structure. On a trailing 12-month basis, fiscal year 2023 book-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times. Regarding the performance of our lines of business let's turn to slide 13 for Q4 performance and 14 for full-year performance. Starting with People & Places Solutions. P&PS continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 adjusted net revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Growth was consistently strong across all business units. Europe rebounded positively after being our weakest region year-to-date and we saw continued strength in the Middle East, Americas, and Asia-Pacific. Backlog was relatively flat sequentially, although gross margin and backlog was up 8% year-over-year as we continue to focus on improving business quality. P&PS Q4 operating profit was up 12% driven by strong growth, maintaining healthy gross margins and solid G&A management resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 15%, up 16 basis points year-over-year. For the full-year, adjusted operating profit was up 16% and adjusted operating margins were 14.6%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. Our P&PS Americas unit, which is our largest by revenue benefited from legislative drivers and a healthy state and local budgets continuing to book client spending. Internationally, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East continued to be bright spots in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits. Additionally, our European business showed a positive sequential growth. Now moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Q4 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and backlog is up 8% year-over-year and the business continues to demonstrate a strong win rate against a very healthy pipeline in all of its core focus areas. CMS operating margins were up 128 basis points year-over-year. For the full-year, margins were roughly flat, while operating profit increased 6% year-over-year. Notably, margins continued to rebound throughout the year as forecasted. Moving to Divergent Solutions, adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q4, as we remain focused on portfolio improvement. We expect growth to accelerate from year-end levels as investments mature and lower-margin contracts roll out of backlog. Operating margins for the quarter was up 10.1% -- was 10.1%, a 50 basis point sequential improvement. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 13% year-over-year in Q4 and increased 4% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. Based on booking trends, we expect revenue growth to show a positive trend in fiscal year 2024 while remaining cautious of the macro risk as the U.K. goes through an election cycle. PA's Q4 operating profit was 20.6%, up 122 basis points year-over-year and up 21% year-over-year. Utilization continues to improve, and we expect operating margins to be over 20% for the medium term. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q4, roughly flat sequentially and consistent with our guidance. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model. However, despite initial cost actions taken, we will carry temporary costs associated with supporting the entirety of Jacobs, including the businesses to be separated. We estimate that we are carrying approximately $40 million in temporary cost throughout this transition period. This allows us the opportunity to reinforce our commitment to our clients and enhanced business resilience. We are confident that these efforts will contribute to a stronger foundation and continued excellence in serving our clients as two leading independent companies. Turning to slide 15 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings. Operating cash flow was $219 million and free cash flow was $180 million. As a result, we were able to deliver above our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the year with 104% underlying cash conversion. During fiscal year 2023, we returned 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders for a total of $480 million through both share repurchases and dividends. Though we were unable to repurchase shares in the quarter due to the CMS separation, we utilize cash flow to strategically pay down floating rate debt, ensuring a more robust financial position for the future. This disciplined approach aligns with our commitment to long-term financial stability and value creation for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with cash of $927 million and gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in just over $1.9 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile, both today and as a more focused business, post our announced CMS separation. In August, we completed the offering of $600 million in senior unsecured notes due 2028 with a fixed rate of 6.35%. This allowed us to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of the end of Q4, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail on our debt and quarterly interest expense. Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. On November 9, we paid a $0.26 dividend, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. Finally, I wanted to highlight our cost optimization plan shared on slide 16. We recognize that our cost structure is high. And we see opportunities to optimize in the coming quarters and post CMS separation. We have identified over $90 million in run rate savings, including lower corporate and allocated costs to the specific measures that we are starting to action. We expect to reduce our corporate unallocated costs from around $60 million per quarter to approximately $50 million per quarter, including full elimination of stranded costs post separation. We are streamlining our operating model with an eye towards positioning us for growth and cost efficiency, while staying focused on our clients. While we will not yet comment on long-term growth and margin expectations beyond our 2025 strategic plan, we believe we can deliver over 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from fiscal 2023 as reported margins to fiscal 2025 for standalone Jacobs. This results in an expected adjusted EBITDA margins for standalone Jacobs of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025. This is a bold undertaken as it is our longer-term aspiration to deliver best-in-class industry margins. In closing, Bob and I are committed to 3 things over the next few quarters. First, driving efficiencies in our business and maximizing our profitability as demonstrated by the margin targets. Second, position in our business with the financial resources needed for multiyear free cash flow growth. Third, strengthening discipline and deploying our shareholder capital. Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Bob. Hi, Jerry, so I would like to -- you have some of the details on this slide. And so let me just go over the details of this slide. So you have first a component of the stranded cost. So that one will happen after the separation. So that's roughly $50 million that you see there. So then you have one that we started to taking action, which is really the operating model, and that will obviously accelerate after the separation, but we've already taken action on that. So you'll see some of that over time in \u201824 and accelerated after the separation. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you have the overhead or the unallocated corporate that we normally see -- you normally see it as a separate line. And I talked about the $60 million down to $50 million. We will carry some temporary costs to support CMS as we prepare it for the independent company or the combined company. And that one as well, you'll accelerate in 2025. So in summary, you'll see a little bit in '24 accelerating after the separation. If I want to give you the nature of what is that, is really the -- a lot of the support is IT, the support layers and just in general, a simpler management structure and support. So Chad, the 13.8% is the stand-alone Jacobs, so it excludes CMS and Cyber & Intelligence. And then the nature of those costs is the three buckets that I mentioned before, which are really corporate unlocated going from the $60 million run rate to $50 million run rate post separation, and then the operating model, which is $50 million in total run rate and then full elimination of stranded costs up to the separation. Good morning. Yes. So Andy, so let's start with the first one, which is the big one and explains roughly half of the gap is the tax piece. And I had -- I included some of them in my remarks. So if I take, it's $0.06, so it's more the -- when you have a one-off allowance, and this is something that happens with your deferred tax. And -- so then the next one is going to be basically overhead costs or unallocated is one, we call it corporate unallocated. That's the other big piece. And then the share count, and I mentioned why we could do stock repurchases in the fourth quarter given -- based on the transaction. So that's at a high level what that means. Then I added some of the commentary that is on the temporary cost that we're carrying as we prepare CMS and the Cyber & Intelligence unit to operate independently. So that's the other piece of the puzzle, if you want. Absolutely. And that's what Bob mentioned that towards the end, that's really our earnings power should exclude that -- those temporary costs. We're very client-centric. It's our clients' mission, and we want to make sure we have quite a bit of value tied to this transaction and the upside that we included in this additional value that we're going to get in the transaction and the new entity. We won the two entities to be very successful. It's temporary. And is to make sure we're preparing to have a very leader that we want and that we continue to be. Hi. Yes. So Steven, let me just make sure I understand. So I'll recap what Bob said, and then I'll address the segment margins. So the first one is the going up to 13.8%, roughly half is just the mix. And by mix, I mean, just what remains with us. The other half is the cost optimization, the streamlining of the operating model. And that is really a function of the remaining businesses removing costs and also the addition of our digital enablement and all that. So that and other works, the segments remain with us or the businesses that stay with us are going to increase their individual margins. Does that answer your question? Both operations that's what the operating model, that's where it shows overall as a company. Yes. Yes. So all our decisions are guided by a few principles. The first one is maintaining an investment-grade rating. Very important for us to maintain the strategic flexibility that we want. So those decisions are guided by our conversations with the rating agencies, especially with this transaction. And the other one is our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. So as we go to the transaction, I think one of the elements is also the element of distribution to our shareholders, and that's one of the reasons I highlighted so much we returned this quarter -- this year, and that is an important guiding principle for us is on a risk-adjusted basis to make the best decisions for our shareholders. And so I think that's an important element in the equation. Thank you, Steve. Hi, Gautam. Yes. So I'd say this is something that we do -- we're doing currently, and we do all the time. So I would say two big levers are the -- our global delivery platform is one, very important, and we have one of the best platforms, if not the best, and it's been for several years. That's the first one. The other one is the digital enablement. And you see at some of the projects that we highlighted today are you see a clear differentiation that we have compared to our competitors, where we -- the digital enablement and the outcome based that Bob mentioned before, drives those more profitable projects. So Andy, this is very closely linked to the execution of the separation. So there will be more towards the end, you will have more because of elimination of -- we talked about the stranded costs and the advisers and all that, but very much throughout if you're going to see it because of the advisory fees and all that I mentioned before. So that's just aligned with the time line of the separation. No, I think we talked about -- well, there is a seasonality of the business. So yes, I'd say yes to that one. And then the ones that I mentioned of the $40 million, just at a high level, the cost that we're carrying to support the separation of CMS. So it's really linked to the transaction or the preparing CMS to operate in the new environment. So those, I would say -- that one amplifies the impact. But I didn't say it would be higher on the $60 million is more what we carry in extra throughout or across the company to support CMS. CMS and Cyber & Intelligence. Thank you."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nJonathan Evans: Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide two of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our third quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. And Claudia will provide an overview of separation-related activities. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Before I hand it over to Bob, I want to address some reporting changes that were made in the quarter. We consistently review our reporting practices to be aligned with best practices for our industry and SEC guidelines. After review, we have decided to amend our name and convention for revenue, excluding pass-through costs from net revenue to adjusted net rent revenue. Note, this is simply a name change intended to make the non-GAAP nature of this measure more prominent and does not impact measurement. In addition, after an internal review, we have made certain minor adjustments to pass-through revenues in certain prior periods to properly reflect amounts that had not been previously included. As a result, in the materials that we have included in the appendix to this presentation, we have adjusted People & Places adjusted net revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Note, this change has been deemed as immaterial has no impact on our reported earnings, operating income or cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Turning to Slide four. I'd like to begin by recognizing the continued commitment and extraordinary talent of our 60,000-plus teammates here at Jacobs. I've now been in the CEO seat for over six months and as I spend time with our clients and our people, I continue to be both inspired and appreciative of the dedication and world-class expertise they bring to some of the world's toughest challenges. Now more than ever, our communities require the brightest and best minds to step forward with innovative and technology-enabled solutions to drive better outcomes. I'm proud of all that we do to play our part to enhance and serve those communities. Firstly, I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business before I move on to our third quarter results. The company continues to make significant progress on the activities associated with the intended separation. In addition, following the announcement, there has been positive interest from multiple outside parties. We are currently evaluating this interest consistent with our commitment to maximize shareholder value. As previously communicated, a spin-off, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2024. Let me reiterate, we are laser-focused on maximizing value for all of our stakeholders. As we progress towards the separation of CMS, our teams continue to work tirelessly to stand up both companies for independent success. In the process, we have identified a number of operational enhancements that we believe will propel each company to greater heights in the future. Consequently, we believe that fiscal year 2024 will be a year of optimization and acceleration. Turning to Slide five, on optimization, we see significant potential to enhance our cost structure and our operating model to continue to drive efficiencies and lead our industry, not just in size but in profitability. This will unleash a more cohesive Jacobs that leverages our digital platforms, consulting and advisory and global delivery model to accelerate our value-creating growth. On acceleration, for many years, we have highlighted investments in growth, in our people, platforms and technology-enabled solutions. We've invested behind and proudly managed a portfolio aligned with secular megatrend, critical infrastructure, water scarcity, sustainability, re-shoring and energy transition. Our clients need us now more than ever, and we are delivering. Jacobs is driving higher growth, higher margin, differentiated expertise and solutions. Our addressable market is growing, and we are already capitalizing on these opportunities. Turning to Slide six and Q3; I am pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our growth is entirely organic. And we continue to drive improving cash conversion, a hallmark of our business model, allowing us to invest behind our growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. Our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year and operating profit up 13% year-over-year. Kevin will detail the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see broad-based green shoots with a gross margin backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top line, which provides visibility and confidence in our expectations that growth will persist at current rates. CMS remains a pillar of stability. CMS Q3 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year, and operating profit increased 12% behind 36 bps of margin expansion. CMS continued to book awards at an over 70% win rate. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in fiscal 2024 and minimal forecasted re-compete pursuits. As a result, the Jacobs team is advancing required flight software and hardware testing for the Artemis II missions scheduled for December 2024, the second scheduled flight of the program and notably its first crude mission. In early July, an integrated team of NASA and Jacobs personnel at Marshall Space Center successfully completed the initial phase of formal qualification testing for the Artemis II SLS flight software, a very exciting time for all involved. PA Consulting sales and backlog once again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and defense sectors. Margins stabilized in Q3 above 21%, supported by strategic cost actions taken during the quarter, and we continue to have the highest confidence in our talented management team. PA continues to see increasing opportunities in energy transition. For example, we assisted a leading offshore wind developer in securing a fixed price electricity contract in Ireland's first offshore wind auction. PA is also seeing significant interest in its digital expertise from clients who are looking to assess AI-related impacts and opportunities for their businesses. As an example, a leading cybersecurity client hired PA to support the development of a comprehensive strategic plan with specific focus on understanding the power of AI and mitigating cyber threats. Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 72% year-over-year growth in operating profit. During the quarter, we won another competitive pursuit with the Ohio Department of Transportation to extend Streetlights Software-as-a-Service offering. Streetlight already provides statewide modeling and traffic analysis, safety programming and support for large scale planning efforts. This new contract is for congestion and freight management functionality to support the state's carbon emission reduction efforts. Turning to Slide seven; looking across the Jacobs enterprise, we continue to see considerable and geographically diverse opportunities in our greater than $2 billion water business. From water reuse to treatment to drinking water coupled with our innovative project delivery offering, demand remains robust. During Q3, we saw a healthy growth behind water scarcity-related pursuits. For example, scope increases and new wins with our long-standing partnership with the Singapore Public Utilities Board. Underinvestment in future proofing needs also -- proofing needs also continue to be a major driver. In the U.S., we have been selected by a large Southern California utility agency to provide program management and strategic funding advisory services to create a more sustainable, drought-resilient local water supply for one of the largest groundwater storage base. And in New Zealand, we were awarded an extension and expansion of our central interceptor program, the country's largest ever wastewater project. We also continue to see environmental and sustainability projects. For example, we landed a marquee $450 million award from the U.S. EPA's Great Lake National Program Office and RegionFind Super Fund to provide environmental, technical management services and associated infrastructure tasks in the Great Lakes area. We also see continuing momentum in legislation and aligned work. IIJA aligned wins continue to accelerate versus the year ago period. And for example, we were awarded the Brent Spence Bridge, an iconic connector of economic development between Ohio and Kentucky which has been postponed for many years. And we continue to closely support the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority in their successful low and no emissions grant application. And subsequent subsequently performed delivery services to provide energy-efficient buses and charging infrastructure. Turning to Slide eight, in summary, we are extremely well poised for this strong growth across sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record for operational excellence. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob, and let me turn right to Slide nine for a financial overview of our third quarter results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7.5%. Adjusted net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 25%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to PA Consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 14.7%, over 100 basis points better sequentially and year-over-year more than offsetting the lower gross margin; Costs were well managed due to discipline and actions taken, and we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue to stay well below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023, improving upon the 16.2% figure realized in 2022. GAAP operating profit was $270 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, other transaction and separation-related costs and restructuring efforts of $38 million and a $1.4 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy. The other transaction, separation related and restructuring costs of $38 million included three distinct types of costs. The first represents approximately 45% of the $38 million and relates to a restructuring initiative in our PA Consulting business to rightsize the cost structure to align with the company's end market demands. The second cost represents approximately 35% of the amount and is associated with our initial advisory and other costs associated with the separation of the CMS. Third bucket, which is approximately 20% of the $34 million, is related to the cost of noncash PA contingent equity-based agreement associated with the PA transaction structure and other miscellaneous incentive costs that were considered part of the total consideration of previous transactions. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $361 million, up over 10% year-over-year. Our total discrete items for the year, excluding the new CMS separation efforts, will remain at the $100 million figure that we have forecasted for the year, well below the total figure of $185 million in 2022. Of this $100 million figure, the total noncash impairment costs will total approximately $45 million. Such impairments will be largely complete as we exit this fiscal year. Of course, as we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS. I would let Claudia provide more detail in her prepared remarks. Our adjusted operating profit to adjusted net revenue was 10.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles; $0.20 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, a $0.01 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint; and a $0.05 adjustment to align to our projected annual adjusted tax rate. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.82, down 2% year-over-year. Importantly, while down versus the year ago period, 2022 benefited from the $0.08 cost investment gain associated with the sale of our WatchGuard investment. In addition, in 2023, incremental interest costs of $0.07 have reduced EPS this quarter versus the year ago figure. The net impact is a $0.15 headwind in EPS year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, with Bob providing an overview of our guidance range at the end of our call, we expect Q4 EPS to show healthy growth versus the year ago period. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $355 million and was down 2% year-over-year, representing 10.5% of adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 3% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1x, with our gross margin and backlog, again, improving year-over-year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q3. People & Places Solutions continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 9% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units, led by advanced facilities. Europe continues to see some pressure, but was more than offset by strength in the Middle East, Americas and Asia Pacific. Backlog was flat year-over-year, although gross margins in the backlog was up 8%, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of work Q3 operating profit was up 13% and 15% in constant currency, driven by strong growth leverage and solid G&A management, resulting in operating profit as a percentage of adjusted net revenue of 14.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect year-over-year improvement and strong people in places operating profit margin and growth to continue in Q4. Our Advanced Facilities unit, which represents approximately 1/4 of our People & Places revenue and benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains, posted at sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite macroeconomic crosscurrents, our Tier 1 customers continue to pursue robust spending plans underpinned by long-term demand drivers. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to be encouraged about the outlook for this segment. Our People & Places Americas unit reported Q3 operating profit with 10%-plus growth as legislation-driven backlog begins to convert at higher rates. For example, IIJA-related profit is trending nearly 20% ahead of our current plan. We remain enthusiastic about our overall growth opportunities with double-digit pipeline growth led by water, cities and places and energy and power. Our Q3 international business, revenue and operating profit were up high single digits year-over-year as Asia Pacific and the Middle East continue to be a bright spot in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions; Q3 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. CMS has benefited from an over 70% win rate year-to-date. And as a result, backlog is up 12% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains very healthy as CMS positions for strategic growth in its core focus areas of space, defense, energy and technology solutions. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our previous guidance, with operating profit up 12% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margins to approximately 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher margin opportunities. Moving to Divergent Solutions; adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year as we remain focused on higher-margin contracts. This trend should be expected to continue near term before an acceleration in coming quarters as our investments in sales and technology offerings bear fruit. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 9.5%, a sequential improvement as compared to Q2's underlying normalized margin when adjusting for the benefit of a large license sale in the prior quarter. We have increasing confidence that the underlying margin momentum over the past two quarters is durable. And as a result, we continue to expect divergence, quarterly margins to approach 10% in Q4. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 3% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, an indication of the company's relative performance to peers driven by their value to clients in a tough economic environment. PA's Q3 operating profit margin was 21.2%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and up over 15% year-over-year. PA management continues to take action to improve utilization, and we expect OP margins to be 20%-plus for the medium term with potential for longer-term improvement. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $62 million in Q3, consistent with our guidance. We expect that our quarterly run rate may remain elevated at or above the recent level for a short period of time. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model focused on infrastructure and advanced facility. Claudia will provide her perspective in her prepared remarks. Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, we posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings despite temporary restructuring and separation-related efforts. Free cash flow was $290 million, resulting in a year-to-date 127% conversion of net income into free cash flow. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver at or above our anticipated 100% recorded and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in shares at an average price of $115. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.2 billion, resulting in just over $2.1 billion of net debt. Our Q3 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit profile both today and as a more focused business post our announced CMS separation. As of the end of Q3, approximately 56% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which increased 13% year-over-year and will be paid on August 25. Before I formally transition the CFO role to Claudia on August 14, I wanted to say a few words on my last earnings call. It has been an honor working with such talented colleagues and witnessing our collective accomplishments over the past 8.5 years. During my tenure, I have observed growth and transformation within our company and I am immensely proud of the achievements we have made together. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Board, leadership team and dedicated employees for their unwavering support, passion and commitment to excellence; to our investors, your trust has been instrumental in our success. While my time as CFO comes to an end, I remain confident in the company's bright future and have no doubt that the company is in good hands with Claudia in the CFO role. I also look forward to supporting Bob in my new role as a special adviser going forward. I will now turn the call over to Claudia.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12, I have now been with Jacobs for just over one year and look forward to formally succeeding Kevin next week. He has been a superb partner throughout this transition period and I feel privileged to help lead this company at such an important inflection point in its history. As EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development, I've overseen the rollout of our strategic stand-up management office at the center of the CMS separation. Our goal is to continue to serve our clients without interruption, optimize both companies operating models and to effectively manage risk associated with the separation. Due to the hard and tireless work of our teams, we have made significant progress towards effective We can also confidently reinforce that we intend to eliminate separation-related stranded costs. In addition, we have identified value levers that we believe can lead to continued productivity gains at independent Jacobs. Last quarter, we outlined independent Jacobs target operating profit margins of 12% from separation alone. Yet, we believe there is further upside, and it is our goal to further expand margins post separation. We'll have more to say about that over time. But one of the most exciting aspects of the separation is the opportunity to drive further growth and profitability with the streamlined Jacobs. Jacobs has a recognized sustainable business model with a strong foundation that aligns purpose with both growth and value creation. I, like the rest of the Jacobs team, am absolutely committed to Jacobs' purpose-led vision. Our vision underpins our commitment to deliver superior results for our shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders. I look forward to meeting more of our employees, clients and investors in the weeks and months to come, as I assume the CFO position. Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 13, due to strong year-to-date performance and forward indicators, we reiterate our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. We will provide guidance for fiscal year 2024 in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. Turning to Slide 14, in closing, I would like to express my tremendous appreciation for Kevin's contribution to the transformational success of our company over the last 8-plus years. Kevin is a great personal friend and has been a fantastic business partner. I am privileged to have his continued support as my special adviser. We are very fortunate to have Claudia as a critical leader on our team. I look forward to her continued accomplishments and contributions building on her success to date. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open. \nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Claudia. Jonathan. Bob. And well done, Kevin. Thank you. Bob, I'm encouraged about the continued backlog margin improvement. Maybe you could share a little bit about where that margin improvement this quarter is coming from? And as you look at the pipeline and some of the recent bookings, how that may play through as we move into 2024 and the mix, given the -- either the three biggest if you want to include CMS on that margin improvement expectation for 2024?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Mike, thanks. I'd say right now, the margin improvement is coming from a couple of key drivers. First is around the mix. We are finding a larger part of our portfolio in the consulting advisory component. And when I say that, I'm not saying exclusively PA, that's across the board, even on our infrastructure engagements right now, we're hitting jobs right at the front end where kind of got a higher-end, higher-margin consultative service component. So mix is definitely a driver. The second component on current margin expansion is around the operational discipline that we've been working on for quite a while. And so our project delivery as well as the stability in our offering has continued to evolve. Moving forward, as far as the continued expansion, the digital enablement is starting to come through. You can't quite see it just yet, but it's becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and this is broad. This is broad across the enterprise. And then the global delivery model. We've been talking about that for several quarters, but that global delivery model is paying some real fruit, and we see that continuing to rise moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Kevin, thanks for all your help.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So you guys mentioned that you had interested parties looking at CMS. To the extent you can, could you give us any more color regarding the interest? Is it from strategic? What's the time frame for when you might make a decision regarding a potential sale? And could you give us any more detail on how to think about CMS' tax basis and how you consider that tax leakage versus a potential spin?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Andy, unfortunately, we can't. That's -- right now, I've just mentioned that the interest is strong. We're evaluating. And we can't go into any more detail on that. I apologize.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's fine, Bob. So then let me ask a different question. You -- People & Places growth moving forward. You mentioned P&PS adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year. I think your main peers suggest morning they're also seeing some acceleration in fiscal funding in the U.S. Do you see IIJA related funding continue to accelerate from here? And do you think you could keep up or accelerate the kind of growth you recorded in Q3 into '24?\nRobert Pragada: We do. We do. The IIJA component is really kind of in the -- I'd still say it's in the early innings, but we're seeing that flow through Andy, we actually got in front of that with the grant component and assistance in the grant applications. That now, coupled with the formulaic based funding that's flowing, has really helped. So yes, we do see that legislation-driven funding, not just IIJA, but also the other legislation that's been passed and that moving forward is going to continue to be a big piece. The other thing that it's done is it has -- it's kind of stimulated other legislative acts around the world. I think there's an EU Chips Act that we've now seen some of the components to as well as infrastructure stimulus coming out in other parts of the world. So kind of the world is getting behind this.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Nice quarter. And congrats, Kevin, and thanks for all your help as well throughout the year. I guess my first question, understanding the margin story that you're talking about consulting mix, project delivery, digital enablement. But as you, depending what happens with CMS and we have the new Jacobs, is there a greater opportunity on the cost side, just to sort of restructure streamline costs as well as what you're seeing on the project delivery or mix side? Just wondering if there's a cost story there.  And then my second question, it was nice to see the strong cash flow in the repurchase in the quarter here. Can you talk about sort of shorter-term capital allocation priorities, share repurchase the way that investors should continue to think about things with acquisitions being more in the sideline?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. Go ahead, Claudia.\nClaudia Jaramillo: So thank you, Jamie. On the first one, the cost opportunities. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see the opportunity -- day 1 is just to start. And with a more streamlined strategy and the business model, we see lots of opportunities for more efficiencies as we can also leverage more our global delivery platform. So efficiencies, more focused strategy and the agility that, that will bring. So lots of opportunities on the cost optimization front. On the capital allocation structure, we are -- we said it before, we are very happy with the opportunities we have, our portfolio. We are focusing on our organic growth, and we see it. We've building this portfolio over time. We see the opportunities to invest in ourselves to continue delivering this growth. So we prioritize that and returning excess cash to our shareholders. So those are the priorities and all that really on a risk-adjusted basis.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good morning, everyone and Kevin, congratulations. I think in your nearly 9 years, the stock has nearly quadrupled. So well done, and Claudia congratulations again. .\nClaudia Jaramillo: Thank you.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just ask on advanced facilities just based on the disclosures, it looks like that's about 1/4 of People & Places at this point, so a really good performance so far. Can you just talk about, given the backlog in that business, is there a runway for that portion of the portfolio to be 30% or more of People & Places over the next year or 2? Just if you could touch on the backlog, Bob, if you don't mind?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. Yes, Jerry, that's a great way of looking at it. The short answer is yes. We see it as a larger part of our portfolio moving forward. Backlog is robust. And I guess what really gives us some confidence in the continued growth, and Kevin mentioned that it was -- it's been six quarters, but just kind of step back, we've been in growth mode in this business for probably the better part of the last four years, is what's happening in the industry You talked about re-shoring, but specifically in life sciences, and it's been well published, the level of technology coming out was really driven by oncology in the past, but now we're seeing things with regards to obesity and then the obesity drugs that are having a positive effect on heart disease, we're seeing that in our pipeline and in our backlog with the Tier 1 customers that we've been doing work for ages. That coupled with the Chips Act and all that's going on in the EV world, we got -- the tailwinds would give us confidence that, that is going to be a bigger percentage of our portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning. and congratulations both Kevin and Claudia.\nRobert Pragada: Thanks, Bert.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bert.\nBert Subin: Maybe just a follow-up on that question, Bob, if you think that Advanced Facility is going to become a larger part of the business and the rest of the business is sort of already on track to grow high single digits, at least in the medium term. Does that lead you to believe that, that business can continue growing double digits for a period of time?\nRobert Pragada: I think right now, the indications are, yes. But the visibility that we have, we have visibility from a project standpoint probably six to nine months out. What we're basing our confidence in is the continued trends in technology. So the short answer is yes.\nBert Subin: Got it. And then just a broader P&PS question. Can you just sort of walk us through what sequentially changes, I guess, as we think about the fourth quarter? I know FX will become relative tailwind, but the guidance has seemed to imply that margins remain at or above sort of the targeted range that you guys have out there with sales potentially also stepping up. So is that in your view, sort of largely driven by IIJA ramp you're starting to see projects come through or is there something else that's posting that?\nRobert Pragada: Go ahead, Kevin.\nKevin Berryman: Look, I would say it's a variety of things: good execution, certainly good growth as it relates to those businesses that we've already discussed in our prepared remarks. And so I think it positions us well to end the year well and ultimately continue to drive forward in 2024.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions and, Kevin, I just wanted to say a very impressive CFO tenure. Congratulations. I wanted to press Claudia on the efficiencies and streamlining comments a little bit more. And I realize it's early days, but I'm just curious where we should expect to see that enhancement? Is it kind of across all the segments? Is it more so in the corporate costs? And then also, Kevin, I think you made a comment about the corporate costs remaining elevated for a short amount of time. So I wondered if that run rate is expected to step down going into next year? Some clarity there would also be helpful.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Yes. Thank you, Sean. So first, I want to say the work is under with way, right? So part of the separation is understanding the entanglements and all that. So just -- and we will be sharing a lot more as we progress in the process. So to explain it is, one, there are many functions or tasks and processes that you have when you put different factors together, and so that applies to different functions. Is it support functions? Is it workflows and so on? So Sean, you can think of finance put in numbers to that, is it HR, is it the delivery model and so on. So as you simplify and streamlined, you see those efficiencies also the ability to share data depending on where you operate. So it really goes at multiple levels. And as I said, we will be sharing that as we progress in the process and the work is underway. And it's a very well structured process and the standup management office that we have. To give you an idea, it's around 25 work streams that we have all the different functions and in operations and everywhere where we operate. And as I said before, one key element of that is our very strong model of the global delivery platform. So that allows us to extract further efficiencies as we maximize the use of that platform.\nSean Eastman: Okay. And my follow-up would be for Bob. I think it was relative to P&PS, but I think you made a comment about being able to continue to grow at current rates. So I just wanted to flesh out as much as we can relative to the top line growth expectations for RemainCo on a go forward?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. We stuck to the [ 6% to 9% ] long-term top line growth rate, and that was what my comment was referring to. And right now, we've got some nice tailwinds behind us. So the higher end of that range is where we are.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys. And I just want to extend my congrats to you, Kevin. So I want to spend some time on the water business. I think you talked about it being a $2 billion business. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of like a pipeline from a pipeline perspective? How to think about the growth rate and margin relative to the broader P&PS targets?\nRobert Pragada: Sure, Chad. The pipeline within the water sector, and I'm talking globally, is probably the fastest-growing pipeline that we have in the business, and that is in the 30%, 40% year-on-year growth in the pipeline. So very robust, being driven by a infrastructure EPA regulations in the states as well as just the need for water, the drought infested areas of not just the U.S. and all that's happening around climate change and then our climate response is driving the need. This need is being funded in a whole variety of sources. I mean these are user fees, these are supplemented by certain government actions that are happening around the world. So all of kind of the drivers are strong and they're not going away. The need is high and governments and state and municipal areas are standing behind it. So we're -- and we're right in the middle of it. And as you know, Chad, we've been a leader in that sector for decades, and that's really coming through.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And how should we think about just the growth rate of that business and margins relative to the broader P&PS segment?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. I'd say margins right now are above kind of the mean margins within the sector today. I think there's some room there. And I think that it's going to continue to be a major part of our overall enterprise-wide portfolio moving forward.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then I think you talked about some restructuring PA. Just trying to get a sense for how to think about any future costs? How to think about margin benefits? And when you think we'll actually kind of get the full run rate of those cost saving initiatives?\nKevin Berryman: Are you talking specifically on PA or what...\nRobert Pragada: Just PA.\nKevin Berryman: Just PA?\nRobert Pragada: Yes.\nKevin Berryman: Well, look, the cost actions have been taken. So we're expecting on a go-forward basis that, that will improve the margins. we have been talking about utilization and rightsizing the business for a while. And ultimately, the management team got to the point where they decided to proactively go after it as opposed to grow into it. And so we're excited about the ability for that to have taken place. Really good work by the management team. And so that run rate is effectively being embedded into the business going forward.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. And sustainable.\nKevin Berryman: And sustainable.\nRobert Pragada: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning Kevin, best wishes. I wanted to zoom into the P&PS profit growth. You were talking before, Bob, about the top line at the high end. Just about the 13% year-over-year profit growth in Q3. Where do you see that going? Is that -- I mean it was still double digit, but it was a slowdown from 21% in the quarter before. So I guess, is this sort of normalizing into a low double-digit trajectory from here or is this -- do you think there's an actual reacceleration here? Just trying to think about how to frame the expectation for that profit growth in Q4 and into 2024?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Steve, I think that from a sustained standpoint, we've been vocal that we could drive double-digit growth from a bottom line perspective. I think there was an earlier question around mix. So we're going to have events where we might get some pops in the business. But I'd say on a sustained go-forward basis that double-digit growth in the sustaining area where it's at now is the way to think about it.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. That's helpful. And then a bigger picture question here. Bob, I'm curious how you're managing the business with regard to the broader economic outlook? There's clearly lots of talk about different types of landings for the economy. What are you planning for at the moment? You're about seven to eight weeks away from the start of our next fiscal year, so how is that affecting the decisions you're making today? Obviously, you're sort of been proactive in streamlining operations, but curious if the different economic landings are factoring into your decision-making 1 way or the other?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. I'd say a couple of things, Steve. One is that we have been very deliberate over the course of several years. And Kevin and I have talked a lot about it over the last years and now you're hearing Claudia say the same thing is that we feel comfortable of those end markets that we are acutely focused in on, have got strong tailwinds. Wouldn't -- nobody is going to say that they are resilient of recession. But those tailwinds aren't going anywhere and are probably less tied to inflation than other consumer-driven type of areas. And even in the area that we have some exposure to the broader consumer, these are now in the world of life sciences and chips and broad-based manufacturing that is tied to geopolitical as well as geoeconomic kind of reshaping of the world. So from a portfolio standpoint, we feel strong. And wherever the economy is going, those tailwinds, we feel confident in. The other is around our operations and our cost posture. We're doing a lot right now on the operating model and how we run the company and how we go to market, and we're using this inflection point with the separation of CMS to even accelerate that component, talk a little bit about in the prepared remarks. So that's creating more internal resilience. And then the last I would say is something that Claudia spoke about earlier, and that's cost optimization. We have known us -- Steve, you've known us for a long time, for decades, we have been a company that has been very acutely focused in on cost and cost management and that's in our DNA, and we're going to continue to do that as we continue to look at the leaner structure prospect.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Your line is open.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And Kevin, it's been a pleasure. I guess I wanted to ask about some of the cash restructuring costs. It looks like they're down the new outlook for them. The split of cash is up a little bit, noncash real estate down a little bit. I suppose that's probably related to the $17 million for PA taken in the quarter on cash restructuring. But I guess there's kind of 2 questions that come out of this. One is, do you think that this round of restructuring charges can flow through to the profit line, recognizing in the past, the various restructuring programs we've had in the past have generally been reinvested for growth? And the second question would be, given that '23 is a little bit higher on the cash restructuring costs, what do you think the outlook for '24 could be? Obviously, the CMS been or the potential sale is a big factor, but do you think that the costs will be up or down versus the roughly $55 million of cash cost that you expect to recognize in 2023?\nRobert Pragada: Kevin, go ahead.\nKevin Berryman: Maybe -- thanks, Andy. But let me take a stab. As Claudia suggested in her prepared remarks, we're working through that right now as we speak, relative to the CMS separation efforts. And so it's premature to really give any perspective on that. I think the bottom line relative to your cash comment for 2023 is basically correct. And so at the end of the day, I think the other point that you asked, is it going to be -- it's going to drop to the bottom line or be reinvested? I think that Claudia has made it very clear in her comments that the stranded cost opportunities are, we believe, of substance, and that's going to take a lot of hard work to get after it. But I think we'll leave it there. And fundamentally, I think what the plan will be is that we'll give some additional color, Claudia and Bob will give some additional color when we talk in our Q4 earnings release and outlook for 2024.\nClaudia Jaramillo: And what I would add to that, Andy, is we use the cash conversion as a key metric for us. So it's really important to show is the cash conversion and we have shown the strong cash conversion. So all these numbers is to help our investors understand the numbers. Hopefully, that helps to analyze the numbers. But the cash conversion remains very strong, and we are very committed to maintaining that strong delivery.\nAndrew Wittmann: Got it. I guess for my follow-up question, I would just ask about Divergent here. I heard the comments for the fourth quarter. This business has always had kind of an implicit kind of ramp that you believe that some of the contracts that you're on will start contributing more significantly. I guess the question is, what's the visibility you have into that ramp? And do you still believe that, that revenue ramp can lead to better fixed cost coverage and push margins up more materially even than you've realized in the last couple of quarters, which has been notable for sure?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Andy, we do. And part of that is, if you look -- if you kind of dissect Divergent, as we've talked about in previous quarters, the area that's growing at the fastest rate are those platforms that we've developed around transportation and water. And those are growing very fast. Now the reason why we're not necessarily seeing that at the top line is because these are platforms that are driving growth at the bottom line for Divergent and creating margin expansion in P&PS, part of that digital enablement of an earlier question, too. So from a bottom line standpoint, the answer would be, yes, we see that visibility, and it's being driven by infrastructure, transportation and water, and we're getting those platforms now into the energy sector as well. So more to follow on how that's going to continue to catalyze P&PS.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSabahat Khan: Okay. Great. Just, I guess, on some of the infrastructure stimulus money that you said you've seen so far. I'm just curious which end markets that's concentrated and sort of where are you winning some work? And then -- and as you look ahead even to kind of the next 12 to 18 months, which end markets, you think we'll probably see more of the money, whether it's IIJA, IRA or the chipset. I'm just curious how it's flowing by end market at this point?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. Sabahat, it's really the early phases of the early innings have been probably indexed more towards transportation. So we're seeing more in that. But now we're kind of starting to see the front end of different -- I mentioned the New Orleans job where we're doing some green fleeting of the bus systems and the other transport. So under the guides of transport, with now some clean energy components that are tied to it, and we'll start to spill over in some IRA application as well. I would say on the larger, whether it be some of the lead-free work or -- I'm sorry, the lead pipe and the lead topic work as well as some additional support of some of the larger water infrastructure, we would expect to see that coming up, too. So transport first, moving into clean energy and the energy component of transport and then down the road water.\nSabahat Khan: Great. And then just more of a housekeeping-type question on the cost improvements that you've talked about on P&PS. I guess just trying to understand, is that -- is the kind of the -- just going full throttle on the plan tied to the timing of the sale or separation of CMS business? Or is that something that's ongoing and we should see a meaningful benefit in your fiscal '24 numbers? Just trying to understand if those two events are tied in terms of timing of when you execute and the savings that we see in fiscal '24.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Yes. So the PA comment is really focused on PA and it's more aligned with the end markets that PA has. So they have a lot of strength in specific markets and then is more aligned the resources with that strength in some markets and then what they see in the other markets that are more flat. So that's really PA related. And then CMS is more the connectivity with -- between CMS and the rest of the company and the comments that Bob made about our efforts looking at our operating model and all the efficiency gains and productivity that we see as we have cost reductions with a more streamlined strategy and execution.\nRobert Pragada: In the 2024, Sabahat, which I think is the last part with P&PS, the answer is yes.\nSabahat Khan: Thinking about the savings from P&PS. Okay. So we should see them in '24?\nRobert Pragada: Yes.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Bob Pragada.\nRobert Pragada: All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining and look forward to continued growth and success. Kevin, thank you so much, and welcome Claudia to the future. Thanks, everyone. Look forward to talking to you next time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and let me turn right to Slide nine for a financial overview of our third quarter results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7.5%. Adjusted net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 25%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to PA Consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 14.7%, over 100 basis points better sequentially and year-over-year more than offsetting the lower gross margin; Costs were well managed due to discipline and actions taken, and we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue to stay well below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023, improving upon the 16.2% figure realized in 2022. GAAP operating profit was $270 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, other transaction and separation-related costs and restructuring efforts of $38 million and a $1.4 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy. The other transaction, separation related and restructuring costs of $38 million included three distinct types of costs. The first represents approximately 45% of the $38 million and relates to a restructuring initiative in our PA Consulting business to rightsize the cost structure to align with the company's end market demands. The second cost represents approximately 35% of the amount and is associated with our initial advisory and other costs associated with the separation of the CMS. Third bucket, which is approximately 20% of the $34 million, is related to the cost of noncash PA contingent equity-based agreement associated with the PA transaction structure and other miscellaneous incentive costs that were considered part of the total consideration of previous transactions. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $361 million, up over 10% year-over-year. Our total discrete items for the year, excluding the new CMS separation efforts, will remain at the $100 million figure that we have forecasted for the year, well below the total figure of $185 million in 2022. Of this $100 million figure, the total noncash impairment costs will total approximately $45 million. Such impairments will be largely complete as we exit this fiscal year. Of course, as we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS. I would let Claudia provide more detail in her prepared remarks. Our adjusted operating profit to adjusted net revenue was 10.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles; $0.20 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, a $0.01 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint; and a $0.05 adjustment to align to our projected annual adjusted tax rate. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.82, down 2% year-over-year. Importantly, while down versus the year ago period, 2022 benefited from the $0.08 cost investment gain associated with the sale of our WatchGuard investment. In addition, in 2023, incremental interest costs of $0.07 have reduced EPS this quarter versus the year ago figure. The net impact is a $0.15 headwind in EPS year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, with Bob providing an overview of our guidance range at the end of our call, we expect Q4 EPS to show healthy growth versus the year ago period. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $355 million and was down 2% year-over-year, representing 10.5% of adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 3% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1x, with our gross margin and backlog, again, improving year-over-year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q3. People & Places Solutions continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 9% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units, led by advanced facilities. Europe continues to see some pressure, but was more than offset by strength in the Middle East, Americas and Asia Pacific. Backlog was flat year-over-year, although gross margins in the backlog was up 8%, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of work Q3 operating profit was up 13% and 15% in constant currency, driven by strong growth leverage and solid G&A management, resulting in operating profit as a percentage of adjusted net revenue of 14.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect year-over-year improvement and strong people in places operating profit margin and growth to continue in Q4. Our Advanced Facilities unit, which represents approximately 1/4 of our People & Places revenue and benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains, posted at sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite macroeconomic crosscurrents, our Tier 1 customers continue to pursue robust spending plans underpinned by long-term demand drivers. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to be encouraged about the outlook for this segment. Our People & Places Americas unit reported Q3 operating profit with 10%-plus growth as legislation-driven backlog begins to convert at higher rates. For example, IIJA-related profit is trending nearly 20% ahead of our current plan. We remain enthusiastic about our overall growth opportunities with double-digit pipeline growth led by water, cities and places and energy and power. Our Q3 international business, revenue and operating profit were up high single digits year-over-year as Asia Pacific and the Middle East continue to be a bright spot in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions; Q3 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. CMS has benefited from an over 70% win rate year-to-date. And as a result, backlog is up 12% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains very healthy as CMS positions for strategic growth in its core focus areas of space, defense, energy and technology solutions. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our previous guidance, with operating profit up 12% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margins to approximately 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher margin opportunities. Moving to Divergent Solutions; adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year as we remain focused on higher-margin contracts. This trend should be expected to continue near term before an acceleration in coming quarters as our investments in sales and technology offerings bear fruit. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 9.5%, a sequential improvement as compared to Q2's underlying normalized margin when adjusting for the benefit of a large license sale in the prior quarter. We have increasing confidence that the underlying margin momentum over the past two quarters is durable. And as a result, we continue to expect divergence, quarterly margins to approach 10% in Q4. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 3% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, an indication of the company's relative performance to peers driven by their value to clients in a tough economic environment. PA's Q3 operating profit margin was 21.2%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and up over 15% year-over-year. PA management continues to take action to improve utilization, and we expect OP margins to be 20%-plus for the medium term with potential for longer-term improvement. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $62 million in Q3, consistent with our guidance. We expect that our quarterly run rate may remain elevated at or above the recent level for a short period of time. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model focused on infrastructure and advanced facility. Claudia will provide her perspective in her prepared remarks. Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, we posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings despite temporary restructuring and separation-related efforts. Free cash flow was $290 million, resulting in a year-to-date 127% conversion of net income into free cash flow. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver at or above our anticipated 100% recorded and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in shares at an average price of $115. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.2 billion, resulting in just over $2.1 billion of net debt. Our Q3 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit profile both today and as a more focused business post our announced CMS separation. As of the end of Q3, approximately 56% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which increased 13% year-over-year and will be paid on August 25. Before I formally transition the CFO role to Claudia on August 14, I wanted to say a few words on my last earnings call. It has been an honor working with such talented colleagues and witnessing our collective accomplishments over the past 8.5 years. During my tenure, I have observed growth and transformation within our company and I am immensely proud of the achievements we have made together. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Board, leadership team and dedicated employees for their unwavering support, passion and commitment to excellence; to our investors, your trust has been instrumental in our success. While my time as CFO comes to an end, I remain confident in the company's bright future and have no doubt that the company is in good hands with Claudia in the CFO role. I also look forward to supporting Bob in my new role as a special adviser going forward. I will now turn the call over to Claudia. Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Bert. Look, I would say it's a variety of things: good execution, certainly good growth as it relates to those businesses that we've already discussed in our prepared remarks. And so I think it positions us well to end the year well and ultimately continue to drive forward in 2024. Are you talking specifically on PA or what... Just PA? Well, look, the cost actions have been taken. So we're expecting on a go-forward basis that, that will improve the margins. we have been talking about utilization and rightsizing the business for a while. And ultimately, the management team got to the point where they decided to proactively go after it as opposed to grow into it. And so we're excited about the ability for that to have taken place. Really good work by the management team. And so that run rate is effectively being embedded into the business going forward. And sustainable. Maybe -- thanks, Andy. But let me take a stab. As Claudia suggested in her prepared remarks, we're working through that right now as we speak, relative to the CMS separation efforts. And so it's premature to really give any perspective on that. I think the bottom line relative to your cash comment for 2023 is basically correct. And so at the end of the day, I think the other point that you asked, is it going to be -- it's going to drop to the bottom line or be reinvested? I think that Claudia has made it very clear in her comments that the stranded cost opportunities are, we believe, of substance, and that's going to take a lot of hard work to get after it. But I think we'll leave it there. And fundamentally, I think what the plan will be is that we'll give some additional color, Claudia and Bob will give some additional color when we talk in our Q4 earnings release and outlook for 2024."

            "name": "Claudia Jaramillo",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12, I have now been with Jacobs for just over one year and look forward to formally succeeding Kevin next week. He has been a superb partner throughout this transition period and I feel privileged to help lead this company at such an important inflection point in its history. As EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development, I've overseen the rollout of our strategic stand-up management office at the center of the CMS separation. Our goal is to continue to serve our clients without interruption, optimize both companies operating models and to effectively manage risk associated with the separation. Due to the hard and tireless work of our teams, we have made significant progress towards effective We can also confidently reinforce that we intend to eliminate separation-related stranded costs. In addition, we have identified value levers that we believe can lead to continued productivity gains at independent Jacobs. Last quarter, we outlined independent Jacobs target operating profit margins of 12% from separation alone. Yet, we believe there is further upside, and it is our goal to further expand margins post separation. We'll have more to say about that over time. But one of the most exciting aspects of the separation is the opportunity to drive further growth and profitability with the streamlined Jacobs. Jacobs has a recognized sustainable business model with a strong foundation that aligns purpose with both growth and value creation. I, like the rest of the Jacobs team, am absolutely committed to Jacobs' purpose-led vision. Our vision underpins our commitment to deliver superior results for our shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders. I look forward to meeting more of our employees, clients and investors in the weeks and months to come, as I assume the CFO position. Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Bob. So thank you, Jamie. On the first one, the cost opportunities. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see the opportunity -- day 1 is just to start. And with a more streamlined strategy and the business model, we see lots of opportunities for more efficiencies as we can also leverage more our global delivery platform. So efficiencies, more focused strategy and the agility that, that will bring. So lots of opportunities on the cost optimization front. On the capital allocation structure, we are -- we said it before, we are very happy with the opportunities we have, our portfolio. We are focusing on our organic growth, and we see it. We've building this portfolio over time. We see the opportunities to invest in ourselves to continue delivering this growth. So we prioritize that and returning excess cash to our shareholders. So those are the priorities and all that really on a risk-adjusted basis. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Sean. So first, I want to say the work is under with way, right? So part of the separation is understanding the entanglements and all that. So just -- and we will be sharing a lot more as we progress in the process. So to explain it is, one, there are many functions or tasks and processes that you have when you put different factors together, and so that applies to different functions. Is it support functions? Is it workflows and so on? So Sean, you can think of finance put in numbers to that, is it HR, is it the delivery model and so on. So as you simplify and streamlined, you see those efficiencies also the ability to share data depending on where you operate. So it really goes at multiple levels. And as I said, we will be sharing that as we progress in the process and the work is underway. And it's a very well structured process and the standup management office that we have. To give you an idea, it's around 25 work streams that we have all the different functions and in operations and everywhere where we operate. And as I said before, one key element of that is our very strong model of the global delivery platform. So that allows us to extract further efficiencies as we maximize the use of that platform. And what I would add to that, Andy, is we use the cash conversion as a key metric for us. So it's really important to show is the cash conversion and we have shown the strong cash conversion. So all these numbers is to help our investors understand the numbers. Hopefully, that helps to analyze the numbers. But the cash conversion remains very strong, and we are very committed to maintaining that strong delivery. Yes. So the PA comment is really focused on PA and it's more aligned with the end markets that PA has. So they have a lot of strength in specific markets and then is more aligned the resources with that strength in some markets and then what they see in the other markets that are more flat. So that's really PA related. And then CMS is more the connectivity with -- between CMS and the rest of the company and the comments that Bob made about our efforts looking at our operating model and all the efficiency gains and productivity that we see as we have cost reductions with a more streamlined strategy and execution."

            "name": "Robert Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Turning to Slide four. I'd like to begin by recognizing the continued commitment and extraordinary talent of our 60,000-plus teammates here at Jacobs. I've now been in the CEO seat for over six months and as I spend time with our clients and our people, I continue to be both inspired and appreciative of the dedication and world-class expertise they bring to some of the world's toughest challenges. Now more than ever, our communities require the brightest and best minds to step forward with innovative and technology-enabled solutions to drive better outcomes. I'm proud of all that we do to play our part to enhance and serve those communities. Firstly, I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business before I move on to our third quarter results. The company continues to make significant progress on the activities associated with the intended separation. In addition, following the announcement, there has been positive interest from multiple outside parties. We are currently evaluating this interest consistent with our commitment to maximize shareholder value. As previously communicated, a spin-off, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2024. Let me reiterate, we are laser-focused on maximizing value for all of our stakeholders. As we progress towards the separation of CMS, our teams continue to work tirelessly to stand up both companies for independent success. In the process, we have identified a number of operational enhancements that we believe will propel each company to greater heights in the future. Consequently, we believe that fiscal year 2024 will be a year of optimization and acceleration. Turning to Slide five, on optimization, we see significant potential to enhance our cost structure and our operating model to continue to drive efficiencies and lead our industry, not just in size but in profitability. This will unleash a more cohesive Jacobs that leverages our digital platforms, consulting and advisory and global delivery model to accelerate our value-creating growth. On acceleration, for many years, we have highlighted investments in growth, in our people, platforms and technology-enabled solutions. We've invested behind and proudly managed a portfolio aligned with secular megatrend, critical infrastructure, water scarcity, sustainability, re-shoring and energy transition. Our clients need us now more than ever, and we are delivering. Jacobs is driving higher growth, higher margin, differentiated expertise and solutions. Our addressable market is growing, and we are already capitalizing on these opportunities. Turning to Slide six and Q3; I am pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our growth is entirely organic. And we continue to drive improving cash conversion, a hallmark of our business model, allowing us to invest behind our growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. Our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year and operating profit up 13% year-over-year. Kevin will detail the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see broad-based green shoots with a gross margin backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top line, which provides visibility and confidence in our expectations that growth will persist at current rates. CMS remains a pillar of stability. CMS Q3 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year, and operating profit increased 12% behind 36 bps of margin expansion. CMS continued to book awards at an over 70% win rate. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in fiscal 2024 and minimal forecasted re-compete pursuits. As a result, the Jacobs team is advancing required flight software and hardware testing for the Artemis II missions scheduled for December 2024, the second scheduled flight of the program and notably its first crude mission. In early July, an integrated team of NASA and Jacobs personnel at Marshall Space Center successfully completed the initial phase of formal qualification testing for the Artemis II SLS flight software, a very exciting time for all involved. PA Consulting sales and backlog once again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and defense sectors. Margins stabilized in Q3 above 21%, supported by strategic cost actions taken during the quarter, and we continue to have the highest confidence in our talented management team. PA continues to see increasing opportunities in energy transition. For example, we assisted a leading offshore wind developer in securing a fixed price electricity contract in Ireland's first offshore wind auction. PA is also seeing significant interest in its digital expertise from clients who are looking to assess AI-related impacts and opportunities for their businesses. As an example, a leading cybersecurity client hired PA to support the development of a comprehensive strategic plan with specific focus on understanding the power of AI and mitigating cyber threats. Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 72% year-over-year growth in operating profit. During the quarter, we won another competitive pursuit with the Ohio Department of Transportation to extend Streetlights Software-as-a-Service offering. Streetlight already provides statewide modeling and traffic analysis, safety programming and support for large scale planning efforts. This new contract is for congestion and freight management functionality to support the state's carbon emission reduction efforts. Turning to Slide seven; looking across the Jacobs enterprise, we continue to see considerable and geographically diverse opportunities in our greater than $2 billion water business. From water reuse to treatment to drinking water coupled with our innovative project delivery offering, demand remains robust. During Q3, we saw a healthy growth behind water scarcity-related pursuits. For example, scope increases and new wins with our long-standing partnership with the Singapore Public Utilities Board. Underinvestment in future proofing needs also -- proofing needs also continue to be a major driver. In the U.S., we have been selected by a large Southern California utility agency to provide program management and strategic funding advisory services to create a more sustainable, drought-resilient local water supply for one of the largest groundwater storage base. And in New Zealand, we were awarded an extension and expansion of our central interceptor program, the country's largest ever wastewater project. We also continue to see environmental and sustainability projects. For example, we landed a marquee $450 million award from the U.S. EPA's Great Lake National Program Office and RegionFind Super Fund to provide environmental, technical management services and associated infrastructure tasks in the Great Lakes area. We also see continuing momentum in legislation and aligned work. IIJA aligned wins continue to accelerate versus the year ago period. And for example, we were awarded the Brent Spence Bridge, an iconic connector of economic development between Ohio and Kentucky which has been postponed for many years. And we continue to closely support the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority in their successful low and no emissions grant application. And subsequent subsequently performed delivery services to provide energy-efficient buses and charging infrastructure. Turning to Slide eight, in summary, we are extremely well poised for this strong growth across sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record for operational excellence. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 13, due to strong year-to-date performance and forward indicators, we reiterate our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. We will provide guidance for fiscal year 2024 in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. Turning to Slide 14, in closing, I would like to express my tremendous appreciation for Kevin's contribution to the transformational success of our company over the last 8-plus years. Kevin is a great personal friend and has been a fantastic business partner. I am privileged to have his continued support as my special adviser. We are very fortunate to have Claudia as a critical leader on our team. I look forward to her continued accomplishments and contributions building on her success to date. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Yes. Mike, thanks. I'd say right now, the margin improvement is coming from a couple of key drivers. First is around the mix. We are finding a larger part of our portfolio in the consulting advisory component. And when I say that, I'm not saying exclusively PA, that's across the board, even on our infrastructure engagements right now, we're hitting jobs right at the front end where kind of got a higher-end, higher-margin consultative service component. So mix is definitely a driver. The second component on current margin expansion is around the operational discipline that we've been working on for quite a while. And so our project delivery as well as the stability in our offering has continued to evolve. Moving forward, as far as the continued expansion, the digital enablement is starting to come through. You can't quite see it just yet, but it's becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and this is broad. This is broad across the enterprise. And then the global delivery model. We've been talking about that for several quarters, but that global delivery model is paying some real fruit, and we see that continuing to rise moving forward. Yes. Andy, unfortunately, we can't. That's -- right now, I've just mentioned that the interest is strong. We're evaluating. And we can't go into any more detail on that. I apologize. We do. We do. The IIJA component is really kind of in the -- I'd still say it's in the early innings, but we're seeing that flow through Andy, we actually got in front of that with the grant component and assistance in the grant applications. That now, coupled with the formulaic based funding that's flowing, has really helped. So yes, we do see that legislation-driven funding, not just IIJA, but also the other legislation that's been passed and that moving forward is going to continue to be a big piece. The other thing that it's done is it has -- it's kind of stimulated other legislative acts around the world. I think there's an EU Chips Act that we've now seen some of the components to as well as infrastructure stimulus coming out in other parts of the world. So kind of the world is getting behind this. Sure. Go ahead, Claudia. Sure. Yes, Jerry, that's a great way of looking at it. The short answer is yes. We see it as a larger part of our portfolio moving forward. Backlog is robust. And I guess what really gives us some confidence in the continued growth, and Kevin mentioned that it was -- it's been six quarters, but just kind of step back, we've been in growth mode in this business for probably the better part of the last four years, is what's happening in the industry You talked about re-shoring, but specifically in life sciences, and it's been well published, the level of technology coming out was really driven by oncology in the past, but now we're seeing things with regards to obesity and then the obesity drugs that are having a positive effect on heart disease, we're seeing that in our pipeline and in our backlog with the Tier 1 customers that we've been doing work for ages. That coupled with the Chips Act and all that's going on in the EV world, we got -- the tailwinds would give us confidence that, that is going to be a bigger percentage of our portfolio. Thanks, Bert. I think right now, the indications are, yes. But the visibility that we have, we have visibility from a project standpoint probably six to nine months out. What we're basing our confidence in is the continued trends in technology. So the short answer is yes. Go ahead, Kevin. Sure. We stuck to the [ 6% to 9% ] long-term top line growth rate, and that was what my comment was referring to. And right now, we've got some nice tailwinds behind us. So the higher end of that range is where we are. Sure, Chad. The pipeline within the water sector, and I'm talking globally, is probably the fastest-growing pipeline that we have in the business, and that is in the 30%, 40% year-on-year growth in the pipeline. So very robust, being driven by a infrastructure EPA regulations in the states as well as just the need for water, the drought infested areas of not just the U.S. and all that's happening around climate change and then our climate response is driving the need. This need is being funded in a whole variety of sources. I mean these are user fees, these are supplemented by certain government actions that are happening around the world. So all of kind of the drivers are strong and they're not going away. The need is high and governments and state and municipal areas are standing behind it. So we're -- and we're right in the middle of it. And as you know, Chad, we've been a leader in that sector for decades, and that's really coming through. Yes. I'd say margins right now are above kind of the mean margins within the sector today. I think there's some room there. And I think that it's going to continue to be a major part of our overall enterprise-wide portfolio moving forward. Just PA. Yes. Yes. And sustainable. Yes. Yes. Steve, I think that from a sustained standpoint, we've been vocal that we could drive double-digit growth from a bottom line perspective. I think there was an earlier question around mix. So we're going to have events where we might get some pops in the business. But I'd say on a sustained go-forward basis that double-digit growth in the sustaining area where it's at now is the way to think about it. Yes. I'd say a couple of things, Steve. One is that we have been very deliberate over the course of several years. And Kevin and I have talked a lot about it over the last years and now you're hearing Claudia say the same thing is that we feel comfortable of those end markets that we are acutely focused in on, have got strong tailwinds. Wouldn't -- nobody is going to say that they are resilient of recession. But those tailwinds aren't going anywhere and are probably less tied to inflation than other consumer-driven type of areas. And even in the area that we have some exposure to the broader consumer, these are now in the world of life sciences and chips and broad-based manufacturing that is tied to geopolitical as well as geoeconomic kind of reshaping of the world. So from a portfolio standpoint, we feel strong. And wherever the economy is going, those tailwinds, we feel confident in. The other is around our operations and our cost posture. We're doing a lot right now on the operating model and how we run the company and how we go to market, and we're using this inflection point with the separation of CMS to even accelerate that component, talk a little bit about in the prepared remarks. So that's creating more internal resilience. And then the last I would say is something that Claudia spoke about earlier, and that's cost optimization. We have known us -- Steve, you've known us for a long time, for decades, we have been a company that has been very acutely focused in on cost and cost management and that's in our DNA, and we're going to continue to do that as we continue to look at the leaner structure prospect. Kevin, go ahead. Yes, Andy, we do. And part of that is, if you look -- if you kind of dissect Divergent, as we've talked about in previous quarters, the area that's growing at the fastest rate are those platforms that we've developed around transportation and water. And those are growing very fast. Now the reason why we're not necessarily seeing that at the top line is because these are platforms that are driving growth at the bottom line for Divergent and creating margin expansion in P&PS, part of that digital enablement of an earlier question, too. So from a bottom line standpoint, the answer would be, yes, we see that visibility, and it's being driven by infrastructure, transportation and water, and we're getting those platforms now into the energy sector as well. So more to follow on how that's going to continue to catalyze P&PS. Sure. Sabahat, it's really the early phases of the early innings have been probably indexed more towards transportation. So we're seeing more in that. But now we're kind of starting to see the front end of different -- I mentioned the New Orleans job where we're doing some green fleeting of the bus systems and the other transport. So under the guides of transport, with now some clean energy components that are tied to it, and we'll start to spill over in some IRA application as well. I would say on the larger, whether it be some of the lead-free work or -- I'm sorry, the lead pipe and the lead topic work as well as some additional support of some of the larger water infrastructure, we would expect to see that coming up, too. So transport first, moving into clean energy and the energy component of transport and then down the road water. In the 2024, Sabahat, which I think is the last part with P&PS, the answer is yes. Yes. All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining and look forward to continued growth and success. Kevin, thank you so much, and welcome Claudia to the future. Thanks, everyone. Look forward to talking to you next time."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Jacobs Solutions Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I will turn things over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Evans.\nJonathan Evans: Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website which we'll reference during the call. In addition, this morning, we published a release announcing our intent to create 2 independent companies with the separation of our Critical Mission Solutions business. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of today's portfolio announcement, then summarizing highlights from our second quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks. And then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Jonathan and thank all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Jacobs has a story of 75-year history of delivering value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We have consistently strived to improve our company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio to capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent markets. Turning to Slide 4. Today's announcement marks a key inflection point as we progress on our journey of continuous improvement and value creation. This morning, Jacobs announced our intent to separate our Critical Mission Solutions business through a spin-off. The decision to separate CMS is a result of a comprehensive review and evaluation to identify opportunities that streamline our portfolio and maximize strategic focus and potential growth opportunities for both future companies. We will sharpen both companies focus on their distinct strategies and operational initiatives that are most relevant to the specific industries in which they operate. Each company will have a tailored capital allocation and structure that is directed towards their respective growth strategies as well as a strength and ability to attract and retain top talent. Moving forward, in addition to our industry-leading position in core sectors, Jacobs will be a higher growth, higher margin, technology-enabled solutions provider continuing to address the world's most complex critical infrastructure and sustainability challenges. Jacobs\u2019s core skill sets in technical and consulting services, coupled with data science and technology-enabled expertise will continue to differentiate us from our peers and allow us to provide end-to-end solutions to our global clients. Our streamlined portfolio will include leading positions in critical infrastructure such as water and environment, energy transition, transportation and the advanced manufacturing sectors. Once the separation is complete, we can focus our attention on building additional capabilities and expertise that matter most to our clients in these areas. And importantly, we'll achieve even greater alignment with our 3 key accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. The new CMS will be a leading pure play government services company that provides technical consulting, applied science research, training, intelligent asset management and program management services to federal government agencies. CMS generated approximately $4.4 billion in FY '22 revenue. Today's announcement is another step in Jacobs' long record of taking bold actions to drive value creation and position our company for an even stronger future. And as we grow and thrive, our partners can achieve more as well. I want to emphasize that this announcement does not change how we work with our clients. As we work towards the separation, it will be business as usual. We remain committed to delivering world-class service to our clients, who will be able to rely on our people they know and trust. Turning to Slide 5. The proposed capital structure, governance and other matters relating to the separation will be communicated at a later date. Subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, we are targeting to complete the separation in the second half of fiscal year 2024 through a distribution that is intended to be tax free to Jacobs shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Turning to Slide 6. I want to reinforce the importance of our inclusive and forward-thinking culture. Last quarter, we reinforced our commitment to inclusion and diversity by including a gender quality KPI in our sustainability linked bond. Jacobs remains categorically committed to this goal. Turning to Q2 on Slide number 7. I want to thank our more than 60,000 global teammates for delivering a record second quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our underlying business remains strong and we continue to drive growth organically. We continue to invest behind and grow share in all key areas of focus against our 3 needle-moving growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. Our People & Places line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 7% year-on-year, 10% in constant currency and operating profit up 21% year-over-year, 25% in constant currency. Our pipeline and gross margin in backlog increased further supported by strong legislative drivers materializing in federal, state and local initiatives. CMS remains a stable base of recurring revenue driven primarily this quarter by the NASA Kennedy rebid award. CMS Q2 revenue was 11% higher than the previous quarter and 5% higher year-over-year. In terms of bookings this quarter, CMS also achieved an impressive overall win rate and the outlook for FY '23 continues to look strong with its pipeline up double digits year-over-year. We continue to invest behind CMS opening our Japan office during Q2, our first organic office opening since 2004. PA Consulting sales and backlog again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and utilities and defense sectors demonstrating momentum and consistency. I'm pleased to see margins improved in the quarter to over 20%, supported by milestone incentive achievement. PA continues to benefit from increased opportunities in Europe. For example, PA won a mandate for a private Scandinavian renewable energy company that is currently active in renewable electricity generation and storage. PA is working with the client to create a market entry strategy across offshore and onshore wind in several new European markets. Our divergent solutions operating unit had a strong operating profit quarter with operating profit up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we extended our collaboration with Palantir across multiple infrastructure applications. Kevin will give more detail in his comments. Looking across the broader market environment, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for growth in climate response and energy and environment. For example, our approximately $2 billion water business continues to exceed expectations and reinforce our position in the water sector. Water continues to be a pacesetter with pipeline growth up materially year-over-year. During Q2, we were awarded the Donald advanced water purification facility by the LA Bureau Sanitation, 1 of the largest reuse projects in the U.S. delivering a more sustainable drinking water source in a drought stressed region. Fittingly, we would like to call attention to drinking water week, an opportunity to proudly celebrate the work we do with utility partners to provide safe drinking water to millions of people around the world. Our cities and places pipeline also grew double digits, including key wins in the Middle East, where we are working to reimagine urban development addressing major environmental and quality of life challenges and predominantly powered by clean energy. Globally, we are seeing significant energy transition opportunities. Last month, we efficiently launched a dedicated business unit in PMPS to focus on significant opportunities in global energy transition to accelerate growth and address the ever-expanding needs of our clients. Turning to Slide 8. During Q2, we were awarded the Gold Medal Award for International Corporate Achievement and Sustainable Development by the World Environment Center, a nongovernmental organization advancing sustainable development through corporate business practices. Their annual Gold Medal Award recognizes 1 international company demonstrating a global vision and a commitment to sustainable development through innovative applications of policies, economic, environmental and social responsibilities. The independent jury commended our thoughtful approach to sustainability, combining commitments with global initiatives and partnerships with positive and far-reaching impact. Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we remain well positioned with our industry-leading ranking across multiple sectors. This is particularly evident in our advanced manufacturing business, where our long-term pipeline increased double digits year-over-year. Further, in our infrastructure business, legislative actions continue to provide visible growth opportunities despite continued political debate on broader topics. For example, recent wins this quarter include 3 significant intelligent O&M programs in California, Florida and Louisiana which we secured through strong differentiation with the use of our digitally enabled platform. We expect operating profit growth to outpace organic top line increases as we remain focused on quality of backlog. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob and good day to everyone. Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter results. Second quarter gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 5%. Net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, a continuation of healthy growth against a tough 10% year ago comparison. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% sequentially in line with the first quarter but down year-over-year. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, approximately flat sequentially but down 90 basis points year-over-year, more than offsetting the lower gross margin percentage versus last year. While we felt the impacts from inflationary pressure, costs were managed well overall to a disciplined cost management. We are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $290 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $10 million noncash charge related to decrease in our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $8 million. These deal-related costs are largely incentive compensation that was considered part of total consideration and PA noncash contingent equity-based agreements associated with the PA transaction structure. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $356 million, up 7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 11% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring-related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect approximately $15 million of restructuring charges for fiscal year 2023. We also expect a total $50 million to $55 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of the year as we continue to further execute our work -- future of work strategy. Finally, we expect $25 million of transaction-related expenses for the full year from deal-related integration and other costs, most of which is performance-based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions. It also includes the noncash contingent-based equity noted earlier associated with our PA transaction structure. These costs do not include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS, given the early stage of our process. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.70 per share and included a $0.20 -- $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, a $0.06 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, $0.03 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs and a $0.25 adjustment to align to our projected annual normalized adjusted tax rate as a result of a large FIN 48 reserve release. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.81, up 5% year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, Bob will provide an overview of our narrowed guidance range later in his prepared remarks. We also note that our Q3 EPS is expected to be relatively flat sequentially to Q2. I would like to highlight that the fiscal year 2022 third quarter adjusted results benefited from a onetime $0.10 gain on an equity investment. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $358 million and was up 5% year-over-year, representing 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year and 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x with our gross margin in backlog, again, improving year-over-year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q2. Our results in the quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and end market resiliency, enabling us to deliver strong, consistent OP growth. People & Places Solutions continues to drive our momentum. Overall, PMPS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends and legislative drivers previously highlighted. Q2 net revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units although Europe continues to see some pressure. Backlog grew 4% year-over-year behind a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Gross margin in backlog was up nearly double digits in constant currency. Q2 operating profit was up 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong growth and G&A control. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.5%, up over 150 basis points year-over-year, again, driven by solid revenue growth and continued cost discipline. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit margin resulting in strong double-digit growth in full year operating profit. Our Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from the investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients which comprise approximately 2/3 of this business. In semiconductors, the evolving macro backdrop has led some smaller clients to evaluate project timing but we remain confident in the long duration opportunity ahead for Jacobs. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our Advanced Facilities growth rate to persist against a very strong year ago comparisons. Our People & Places Americas unit reported record Q2 profit with 30% year-over-year growth as our high-quality backlog begins to convert to revenue at improving incremental margins. We remain enthusiastic about our growth opportunity as backlog and sales pipelines remain robust as we compare to stronger year-ago comparisons. In particular, our water sales pipeline of opportunities continues to shine, up double digits. Our international business, Q2 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year. Asia Pacific and the Middle East continues to grow, driven by strong pipelines in transportation, cities and places and energy transition. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to space exploration, national security, nuclear remediation priorities and U.S. 5G telecom investments. Q2 revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 7% in constant currency. CMS book-to-bill was just over 1.4x benefiting from the Kennedy award that we previously disclosed. As a result, backlog is up 8% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains strong with $30 billion in new opportunities that we are pursuing. In addition, we are awaiting award on $10 billion in new business opportunities that are in the end gain select process. CMS gross profit margins improved sequentially due to mix. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially from Q1 and consistent with our previous guidance but down slightly versus the very strong year ago quarter. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023, with full year CMS margins expected to approach 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher-margin opportunities. Moving to Divergent Solutions. Net revenue declined 3% year-over-year as we focus on quality growth opportunities that will translate into higher margins. We continue to expect net revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings. Operating profit for the -- operating profit margin for the quarter was above our corporate average at 11.1%. During the quarter, we recognized a large license sale which expanded the margin by more than 300 basis points. Sales of these types of solutions are now a longer-term financial benefit of our Divergent Solutions strategy and a core offering of the reporting unit. Although deals of this size should not be expected to recur every quarter. Even excluding the benefits of the license sale, the underlying margin momentum seen in Q2 continued to improve sequentially for our previous guidance. As a result, we expect Divergent quarterly margins to approach 10% as we near the end of the fiscal year the scale begins to further mitigate the impact of the continued investments for growth. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 1% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but up over 11% in local currency. PA once again reported a book-to-bill over 1x. We continue to expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during the second half of fiscal 2023. Turning to profitability. Q2 operating profit margin for PA was 21.8%, up 370 basis points sequentially due to fixed price milestone achievements and lower incentive costs. As PA continues to take actions to improve utilization, we expect OP margins to be around 20% in the back half, relatively close to their year-to-date OP margin performance. Our unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q2, an increase over our previous run rate estimate, driven by inflationary pressure in health care and digital investments. For the full year, we now expect our quarterly run rate for the balance of the year and unallocated corporate costs to be in line with our Q2 level, driven by inflationary pressure in health care costs and incentive costs. Turning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation which is indicative of the quality of earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $97 million, resulting in approximately 100% conversion of net income into free cash flow for the first half of fiscal year 2023. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion resulting in just over $2.2 billion of net debt. Our Q2 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. As of the end of Q2, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt and our weighted average interest rate was 4.8%. In February, Jacobs completed the refinancing of existing debt and Jacob's inaugural issuance of a $500 million sustainability-linked bond. The bond was priced at a competitive fixed rate and includes a KPI aligned with Jacobs commitment to increase gender diversity and leadership positions and to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. For your benefit, in the appendix of this presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on June 23. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives and narrow our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. Finally, with today's announcement, we are reinforcing our continuous commitment to take proactive actions to create greater shareholder value as well as strategic and value-creating benefits for both future companies and their respective stakeholders. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this morning from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess my first question, just sort of related to the spin. Can you just sort of help us talk through your decision to spin versus sell the asset and/or any sort of dissynergies associated with spinning the CMS business? And then I have a follow-up question after that.\nRobert Pragada: Okay. So maybe I'll start off and then Kevin, I'll turn it over to you. With regards to the second part first, Jamie, we do not see dissynergies with the spin. On the spin, specifically, we were looking for the most optimal tax-free benefit for our shareholders as well as our confidence in the business that it has the credibility and the horsepower to operate successfully as an independent entity. So those were kind of the drivers we're looking to obviously maximize shareholder value. Kevin, anything you want to add?\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, I think we've evaluated all alternatives. And at the end of the day, given the facts and circumstances that Bob has highlighted, we're excited about the announcement of the spin. But as circumstances change or anything comes to light, we would certainly have to consider that because we are interested in maximizing shareholder value.\nJamie Cook: And then I guess just my other just sort of now that we're sort of splitting the businesses, is there any way you could sort of frame how you think about longer-term or medium-term organic growth or margin targets associated with the different businesses as they sit today?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Maybe I'll answer the first part and then you talk about margin targets, Kevin. So as far as our growth expectations for the business, they're very strong and in line with what we articulated in our '22 strategy for the segment reporting. So we feel that pipeline as well as the opportunities in front of us with the platform that we have, looks very, very bright for the RemainCo post spin. Kevin, you want to add anything?\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, as we talked in the prepared remarks, as we look at the 2 businesses and we talk about 2022 kind of pro forma, if we had done something, we had a 12% margin for the People & Places business, operating profit margin and about 8% for CMS. We think that our spend will ultimately allow the 2 incremental individual companies to focus on their respective opportunities and in a manner that allows for, if anything, an acceleration in growth. I do would like to say that in the event that the spin is able to be executed, we are -- we do realize that there will be some incremental CMS public company costs that would have to be incurred but we will think we'll be able to offset and then some with our opportunities to streamline our 2 organizations.\nOperator: We go next now to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Congrats on the announcement. So backlog continues to rise in P&PS. Obviously, there are some cross currents given concerns around private spend but state and local governments, I think, continue to spend -- you've talked about funding ramping from the fiscal bill. So do you see backlog growth continuing there sequentially over time? And can you sustain that 10% year-over-year constant currency growth that you have in the segment?\nRobert Pragada: Let me answer the backlog growth. Right now, the way our pipeline is lining up, Andy, the answer is yes. We do see consistent opportunity to increase our backlog and grow the business. Part of the 10% constant currency growth on the top line, I think that's going to be dependent on the phasing of the jobs, how these jobs come out, especially on the infrastructure side as well as in our private sector business those early phases of the job tend to be more study and higher-end consulting work. And then as we move through subset phases, kind of where the larger the revenue opportunities are. So I wouldn't want to go and say that that's going to be a consistent quarterly topic but definitely a target if you were to aggregate over a period of time.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And maybe a similar question with CMS. You've got did get a backlog uplift from Kennedy? And I think you mentioned that the pipeline is up double digits. But how are you thinking about backlog and CMS moving forward? What is the risk that that's going to be, could slow down bookings a bit for a couple of quarters?\nRobert Pragada: Actually, we see the backlog potential in CMS being strong. The pipeline of work that we have and not just the rebid but the new work that's coming down the pike they provide some real opportunity for us to continue that backlog growth. So we feel confident about that.\nOperator: We go next now to Michael Dudas at Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: So with regard to the spin and is there any of the businesses in CMS, I guess you highlighted 5G maybe staying with the business, the automotive side? Anything from CMS that may stay with Jacobs and maybe vice versa, given some of the demand for security and issues that have been leveraged from CMS to your customer based on the PP&S side.\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Michael, just to clarify 1 point. We didn't -- actually 5G and automotive are a part of the CMS segment and that's actually what we were reporting today. So I just want to clarify that point. I would say as far as what stays, what goes, we're early in that process. And so to be direct and to provide clarity, it is the CMS segment today.\nMichael Dudas: Got it. But there's -- you're still debating where the things could adjust between now and let me set things of current? Is that what I understand?\nRobert Pragada: No, we're not. We're not. And so I just want to provide clarity on that.\nMichael Dudas: Got it. Terrific. Second question is you've -- it seems like again, the last couple of quarters, your new projects and new contracts in the backlog have come in at better margin rates than prior I assume you anticipate that going forward in both -- in all the segments? And how do you see the execution of getting that margin from the backlog to the bottom line? Is that something that we can see more acceleration as we maybe track into fiscal year 2024?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So on the margins themselves, I mean, I think clearly, it's been a part of our strategy for not just '22 but '19 as well. We are in -- we continue to going up the value chain for our clients. And as we do that and we're getting more into the higher-end consultancy work, we're seeing the incremental effect on our booked margin as far as how that's dropping into the bottom line, I think 2 parts, Michael, that you're highlighting. One is that kind of excellence in project delivery which has been a part of our DNA for decades, that continues to be high on our list on delivering not only to our clients' expectation but within our financial expectation as we're booking these shops. As far as the last part of your question on the timing of that dropping to the bottom line. We're seeing a nice pace in the marketplace. And this kind of goes to all segments of our business. After a period of time, I think, in the beginning of Q1 and maybe in the back half of last year, that was having an effect on our top line and some of our actuals to forecast, that is reconciled back and hence, the performance this quarter. And so all indications that we're getting from our clients is that's going to continue.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: First 1 is kind of high level. Just rewinding to the Strategy Day from last year, we kind of got a vibe from that update that you guys were kind of embarking on a deeper integration of the business units with the Divergent Solutions segment kind of being a bridge. And today, we're kind of talking about a more exciting outlook as separate entities. So I'm just curious what changed there. I hope that's a fair question.\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Sean, we're constantly looking at our portfolio and doing an evaluation on how we're executing externally with our clients and the effect that, that is having on advancing our strategy. So is it -- to reflect back on what we -- where we were before. I don't think we're doing anything that's different from what we articulated in our strategy. And so we feel confident in the decision that we made today.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Understood. And then relative to the Divergent Solutions dynamic between investing in growth and kind of releasing margins. Any update post the review you guys did on how you're balancing those 2 things?\nKevin Berryman: Well, look, I think that we are continuing to invest in what we think is a great opportunity to enable divergent actually People & Places and PA to benefit from some of the overall investments being made in digital data capabilities for the total Jacobs. And so those investments continue because we believe there is strong rationale for a very large return relative to that. So we're not making any choices relative to those investments. We continue to make them and we're confident in the ability that the scale is growing as it did in the quarter and how we've communicated a sequential growth in terms of the top line which will translate into a growth leverage factor that translates into margin improvement. As we highlighted in our pared remarks. Nothing has changed. We feel good about that. We see visibility forward to be able to do that. So investments continue. And our growth is going to allow for us to get to the margin profile that we've communicated.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Bert Subin at Stifel.\nBert Subin: So your updated earnings guidance range are things to contemplate maybe a slight up -- maybe a slightly more tempered growth path in the second half of this fiscal year. Can you just walk us through what you see as the potential positive drivers that could get you a little closer to the high end of $7.45 EPS? And then maybe highlight where your visibility is a little bit weaker.\nRobert Pragada: Kevin, why don't you start off from a market standpoint, I'll talk after that.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, clearly, as we look going forward, I think there's a couple of things to highlight. Certainly, we've got inflationary pressure on the medical cost. And ultimately, we're going to be able to pass that along to our clients. But in the short term, certainly, we're seeing some pressure in that. We saw it in the first quarter. First quarter is, as you know, the last year of our medical plan. So we wanted to get a better read on our second quarter which now is in the next plan year. We continue to see that occurring in Q2. So we're projecting that, that's going to continue through the full year. So assuming that, that didn't happen, that obviously would be a positive. But right now, that's what our expectations are. Our interest rates obviously are higher year-over-year. And we think we're at hopefully, the top end of kind of what the interest rate scenarios are going to look like and that, if anything, we're going to be able to trend down. If that happens, we're not counting on it but certainly, that would allow for us to be able to have some incremental performance in our EPS figures as well. I think the underlying business is actually quite strong. And so absent some of these dynamics, I think putting it into context, we don't really see a situation where our business is slowing.\nRobert Pragada: Well said. Not going to add any comment.\nBert Subin: Okay, great. And maybe just a follow-up to the CMS spin announcement, now that you're doing that portfolio rationalization. How should we think about capital allocation maybe over the next 4 quarters does the transaction not taking place for another year to maybe more of a conservative view towards M&A and buybacks? Or do you go full steam ahead here now that you have the plan underway.\nRobert Pragada: Kevin?\nKevin Berryman: So look, I think that, clearly, we have in front of us, a lot of execution that is really imperative for us to do well against. Whether that be on our business or it be the actual execution of the spin of CMS. So that is clearly job number 1. Number 2 is, because of that, certainly, I think there is a relatively high bar right now from a financial people, gross margin perspective as it relates to actually deploying additional capital in the M&A. Never say never but we think the bar is pretty high at this particular moment. So having said all of that, there certainly is opportunities to invest back in our shares as appropriate. And I think that you might want to think about that potentially happening over the course of the next several months.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Just wanted to add -- we really like what we got.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Steven Fisher of UBS.\nSteven Fisher: How should we think about the second half '24 timing for the spin? I think that's within the normal range for these types of transactions. But still seems like it's a bit long dated. Is there any potential to accelerate that if it stays a spin? And what are the factors there? Just curious if the debt ceiling discussions and continuing resolutions and federal budget. Is that all a factor? Or is it more just the internal process?\nKevin Berryman: No. Look, it is certainly a process, both internal but also external. So as you may be aware, the process of putting in place a structure and an organization that facilitates an ability on day 1 to execute and manage a publicly traded company is not inconsequential. And so we're not going to rush that process. And I think 12 to 18 months is actually a fairly aggressive stance in some respects. So I don't think we're going to be able -- if, in fact, it continues to be oriented around the spend to do much better than that. But occurs, we'll do whatever we can to accelerate for sure.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And then P&PS is going to really be the biggest contributor to profits post spin. So there's going to be a lot of focus on that and particularly the margin. So just looking at the sequential margins this quarter were down in P&PS but up 150 basis points year-over-year. It sounds like you think we should focus on the year-over-year there. But I'm curious about how we should think about mix within P&PS and how might that affect margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Steve, a couple of things. One is that we were pretty clear last quarter that on the quarter-to-quarter or at least Q1, that had some project incentive releases that were onetime. As far -- so another way of saying we need to really take a look at the year-over-year comparisons. And then the -- for all of us to be aware that we put margin targets out at our Strategy Day. And just to do kind of a midterm report on that, we are actually a year ahead of where we said we were going to be on our margin profile. So that's a -- look at it over the period of time, so I hope that clarifies that.\nKevin Berryman: So 1 thing, just to crystallize and make sure that you caught it correctly. Our margins in CMS Q1. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nRobert Pragada: And as far as that continuing, Steve, I missed 1 part of your question. As far as that continuing, we evaluate based on our clients and trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And as we said in the script, those have been very, very strong in the P&PS world. So we continue to have confidence in our business.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Chad Dillard of Alliance Bernstein.\nCharles Dillard: Just wanted to dig into the spend a little bit more with the, I guess, like the remaining Jacobs business. Can you talk about like what the cash conversion profile looks like? And how you'll think about capital allocation once the spin is done and if there's any potential gaps that need to be filled on the capability side once it's complete.\nKevin Berryman: So we're early in our process, Chad. We do know that People & Places and CMS both have good cash flow characteristics. Actually, People & Places has a lower DSO level than the current CMS organization. So we're working through all of that. We'll provide incremental details relative to when we get to that space to really give greater clarity. But I think you're going to see both businesses being robust in terms of their cash flow capabilities longer term.\nRobert Pragada: And Chad, on the second part that you asked about the capabilities, we feel strong that we've got a strong platform. We feel strongly that we've got a really solid platform today. In areas where we continue to innovate is around our digital platforms and our digital enablement and the partnership that we have with Palantir and with others, that is that's -- those are strong platforms in order to grow without making huge investments. So we're really comfortable where we sit today.\nCharles Dillard: That's helpful. Then second question on PA with respect to the margin. Now you guys talked about operating margins getting to like the 20% range in the second half. But maybe kind of thinking a little bit longer term, just would like to understand what's the path to bring you back to, I guess, what your target range would be?\nKevin Berryman: I would say that we think -- we're thinking longer term that there's no cap ultimately at the 20% level. So we'll work to continue to drive with the management team and ability to get back to margins that are north of 20% longer term.\nOperator: Next now to Michael Feniger of Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: I'm just curious there, there's obviously a headline. I know someone brought up the government shutdown but there's also headlines with the House bill potentially trying to repeal the IRA clean energy tax incentives many things that's not likely. But I'm just curious on the ground through the channel on fieldwork. Are any of these headlines starting to slow project activity as these headlines pick up does it maybe push some things out to the right in the near term that we should be aware of?\nRobert Pragada: So Michael, the short answer is no. IIJA, that's where we made specific commentary about that in the script, has really started to incrementalize in our business and we can see it not only in our pipeline but in our bookings. And it's realizing itself in that was -- it's why we specifically called out P&PS Americas on the 30% year-over-year growth. So we're not seeing that at all. And just 1 other -- just a clarifying point on IIJA, it's a law, right? So as far as it being repealed, there would have to be significant -- there have be a new law. And so we feel confident about that. On some of these other items, those were actually in the early stages and we had not even -- we had not seen the effects of those in our pipeline or in our work. So the fact that there's a debate about those now, it's not really having that material effect on the business.\nMichael Feniger: Good to know. And just lastly, there was a comment about Europe. It seems like there's some mixed signals, some positives and negatives. What are you kind of seeing in Europe when we think of like the PA and the PPS business?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Interesting, I kind of separated between PA and P&PS. Our PA business in the U.K. specifically is actually growing and it's been really, really strong. And that's kind of a testament to no different than Jacobs historically, real strong capabilities in those areas of global priorities and national priorities and it's around the defense sector that PA has a strong relationship with MOD as well as in energy and utilities which, in fact, is turning into a security issue in broader Europe. So that's really driving the PA business. What's driving the PA and the P&PS business is the energy security issue in the broader Continental Europe as well as in Scandinavia. And I'll give you just 1 statistic. 1 year ago, 2 years ago, of our U.K. platform which you know is really, really strong, about 90% of our folks that were based in the U.K., worked in U.K. business. Today, that's about 60-40 is where we have our talent from the U.K. working on programs and projects and engagements all throughout Europe as well as globally. And that goes into -- Kevin and I have been really vocal about that over the course of the last 3 or 4 years about tying that global talent. So it doesn't totally dampen the effect of some of the economic headwinds in Europe but our diversity is helping in that front.\nOperator: We go next now to Gautam Khanna at Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Congrats, Kevin and Claudia. I just wanted to go back to -- I think it was the first question in the Q&A on any sort of dissynergies and I don't mean quantitative necessarily but are there any linkages that CMS and PA or CMS and P&PS, we're able to just be more competitive on bids because you could bid the broader qualifications of the entire enterprise that might be lost and I was also thinking just when PA was acquired, I thought 1 of the thrust was to bring them outside of the U.K. which you just talked about but into the U.S. and into some of the government customers. And does that potential opportunity may be look less optimistic if CMS is not under the same roof.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So Gautam, it's Bob. One of the things that -- we looked at this really, really hard. And as far as the dissynergies go, we feel pretty confident that, that's not going to be of any materiality at all. Now that said, similar to what we've done in the past, our relationship post spin with CMS is going to continue to be very strong. And so our ability to work together, collaborate and partner for the benefit of our client is going to continue to be there. So that's always going to be there. In fact, we've demonstrated that in our history with a previous divestiture that we did and that relationship continues to this date to be very, very strong. On the PA outside of the U.K., really that entrance into the U.S. which we're in real time and having success on was around the private sector in the U.S., not the government sector and more specifically around energy and utilities and health and life sciences. And those opportunities have continued In fact, today, in the U.S., we have probably 50 active pursuits with a lot of cases, bids in play with PA and we're feeling really confident about that.\nGautam Khanna: And if I might follow up just on the decision to spin versus an outright sale, can you talk a little bit about what the tax basis of CMS would be because presumably, when you announce something like this that potential suitors would also be interested, I would imagine. So what is the tax basis of the enterprise CMS?\nKevin Berryman: So we've evaluated all the opportunities. And depending upon if you were to do some type of other structure, we'll ultimately determine what the tax basis is. But clearly, if we did some type of other transaction, there would be some tax implications that would occur. So the fact that we've centered around executing against spend is a tax-efficient way of addressing the opportunity to create 2 separate very strong companies. And so look, I think that's how we're executing. That's our plan at this particular point in time. It takes a little bit of time given some of the discussions that we've had in the past. But that's 1 of the reasons that we consider the spin to be a highly attractive option. But as we go through the process and determine if we get any additional facts or circumstances that could change that, we'll consider that because we are ultimately interested in ensuring that we maximize shareholder value.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question this morning from Andy Wittmann of Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: So I was going to ask here on some of the capitalization, I guess, of NewCo and some of the cash costs to spin off. So could you, Kevin, comment on what you think a realistic range for cash cost to effectuate the spin would be as well as your thoughts on where the debt would sit I would guess that you'd keep them ratable or similar leverage based on the relative EBITDA. But I guess from a practical standpoint, I guess, NewCo probably gets spun out at with no debt and then would borrow and then pay like a cash dividend back to RemainCo to achieve the capitalization. So kind of a lot in here but I guess there's another aspect to it which is as you're ranging new debt in today's debt markets, what's the net impact on interest expense from having to recapitalize a new company?\nKevin Berryman: So look, I'll make my first comment in response to your detailed questions is we remain committed to the Jacobs RemainCo that it's going to be investment-grade rating. So I think that gives you a ground post that you can certainly evaluate what the potential options may or may not look like. The second thing I would say is we're a little bit too early in the process. We have kept this to a very small group of executives and team members up until this point in time. And now we are -- as we publicly announced, we're going to go through a very detailed, thoughtful, disciplined process that will answer all of these questions. I do think that the way we would characterize the leverage factors, they're going to be appropriate relative to the businesses in which they are. So I think I'll just leave it there and I think you can interpret what that may or may not mean. But we think ultimately that there is an ability to have a stand-alone organization that will -- that is now CMS which is going to be -- have an ability to be quite successful longer term and people in places and PA and divergent as well as the RemainCo.\nAndrew Wittmann: Got it. And then I guess just for my follow-up. I think I heard on your revenue outlook for Divergent that you're expecting good acceleration. Maybe I missed it but did you have a comment on the second half revenue performance that you're expecting for CMS? I think previously, this business also was expected to see an acceleration. I just wanted to make sure I heard your latest on that one.\nKevin Berryman: Well, look, we didn't really comment about CMS, although I think what I would focus on in CMS is really more about the margin, sequential improvement which we think is really important as we get the business back to that level of 8% for the full year which is what we characterized. And so perhaps I'll leave it there because we didn't really talk about the CMS numbers; still growing.\nOperator: And Mr. Pragada, I'd like to turn things back to you, sir, for any closing comments this morning.\nRobert Pragada: Yes, thank you. It's exciting times ahead. We're really looking forward to what the future brings. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call and we'll be very close to the market continue -- as things continue to develop and progress. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Jacob Solutions second quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast. We'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great rest of your day. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob and good day to everyone. Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter results. Second quarter gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 5%. Net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, a continuation of healthy growth against a tough 10% year ago comparison. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% sequentially in line with the first quarter but down year-over-year. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, approximately flat sequentially but down 90 basis points year-over-year, more than offsetting the lower gross margin percentage versus last year. While we felt the impacts from inflationary pressure, costs were managed well overall to a disciplined cost management. We are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $290 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $10 million noncash charge related to decrease in our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $8 million. These deal-related costs are largely incentive compensation that was considered part of total consideration and PA noncash contingent equity-based agreements associated with the PA transaction structure. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $356 million, up 7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 11% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring-related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect approximately $15 million of restructuring charges for fiscal year 2023. We also expect a total $50 million to $55 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of the year as we continue to further execute our work -- future of work strategy. Finally, we expect $25 million of transaction-related expenses for the full year from deal-related integration and other costs, most of which is performance-based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions. It also includes the noncash contingent-based equity noted earlier associated with our PA transaction structure. These costs do not include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS, given the early stage of our process. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.70 per share and included a $0.20 -- $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, a $0.06 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, $0.03 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs and a $0.25 adjustment to align to our projected annual normalized adjusted tax rate as a result of a large FIN 48 reserve release. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.81, up 5% year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, Bob will provide an overview of our narrowed guidance range later in his prepared remarks. We also note that our Q3 EPS is expected to be relatively flat sequentially to Q2. I would like to highlight that the fiscal year 2022 third quarter adjusted results benefited from a onetime $0.10 gain on an equity investment. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $358 million and was up 5% year-over-year, representing 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year and 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x with our gross margin in backlog, again, improving year-over-year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q2. Our results in the quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and end market resiliency, enabling us to deliver strong, consistent OP growth. People & Places Solutions continues to drive our momentum. Overall, PMPS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends and legislative drivers previously highlighted. Q2 net revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units although Europe continues to see some pressure. Backlog grew 4% year-over-year behind a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Gross margin in backlog was up nearly double digits in constant currency. Q2 operating profit was up 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong growth and G&A control. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.5%, up over 150 basis points year-over-year, again, driven by solid revenue growth and continued cost discipline. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit margin resulting in strong double-digit growth in full year operating profit. Our Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from the investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients which comprise approximately 2/3 of this business. In semiconductors, the evolving macro backdrop has led some smaller clients to evaluate project timing but we remain confident in the long duration opportunity ahead for Jacobs. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our Advanced Facilities growth rate to persist against a very strong year ago comparisons. Our People & Places Americas unit reported record Q2 profit with 30% year-over-year growth as our high-quality backlog begins to convert to revenue at improving incremental margins. We remain enthusiastic about our growth opportunity as backlog and sales pipelines remain robust as we compare to stronger year-ago comparisons. In particular, our water sales pipeline of opportunities continues to shine, up double digits. Our international business, Q2 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year. Asia Pacific and the Middle East continues to grow, driven by strong pipelines in transportation, cities and places and energy transition. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to space exploration, national security, nuclear remediation priorities and U.S. 5G telecom investments. Q2 revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 7% in constant currency. CMS book-to-bill was just over 1.4x benefiting from the Kennedy award that we previously disclosed. As a result, backlog is up 8% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains strong with $30 billion in new opportunities that we are pursuing. In addition, we are awaiting award on $10 billion in new business opportunities that are in the end gain select process. CMS gross profit margins improved sequentially due to mix. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially from Q1 and consistent with our previous guidance but down slightly versus the very strong year ago quarter. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023, with full year CMS margins expected to approach 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher-margin opportunities. Moving to Divergent Solutions. Net revenue declined 3% year-over-year as we focus on quality growth opportunities that will translate into higher margins. We continue to expect net revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings. Operating profit for the -- operating profit margin for the quarter was above our corporate average at 11.1%. During the quarter, we recognized a large license sale which expanded the margin by more than 300 basis points. Sales of these types of solutions are now a longer-term financial benefit of our Divergent Solutions strategy and a core offering of the reporting unit. Although deals of this size should not be expected to recur every quarter. Even excluding the benefits of the license sale, the underlying margin momentum seen in Q2 continued to improve sequentially for our previous guidance. As a result, we expect Divergent quarterly margins to approach 10% as we near the end of the fiscal year the scale begins to further mitigate the impact of the continued investments for growth. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 1% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but up over 11% in local currency. PA once again reported a book-to-bill over 1x. We continue to expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during the second half of fiscal 2023. Turning to profitability. Q2 operating profit margin for PA was 21.8%, up 370 basis points sequentially due to fixed price milestone achievements and lower incentive costs. As PA continues to take actions to improve utilization, we expect OP margins to be around 20% in the back half, relatively close to their year-to-date OP margin performance. Our unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q2, an increase over our previous run rate estimate, driven by inflationary pressure in health care and digital investments. For the full year, we now expect our quarterly run rate for the balance of the year and unallocated corporate costs to be in line with our Q2 level, driven by inflationary pressure in health care costs and incentive costs. Turning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation which is indicative of the quality of earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $97 million, resulting in approximately 100% conversion of net income into free cash flow for the first half of fiscal year 2023. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion resulting in just over $2.2 billion of net debt. Our Q2 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. As of the end of Q2, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt and our weighted average interest rate was 4.8%. In February, Jacobs completed the refinancing of existing debt and Jacob's inaugural issuance of a $500 million sustainability-linked bond. The bond was priced at a competitive fixed rate and includes a KPI aligned with Jacobs commitment to increase gender diversity and leadership positions and to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. For your benefit, in the appendix of this presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on June 23. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bob. Yes. Look, I think we've evaluated all alternatives. And at the end of the day, given the facts and circumstances that Bob has highlighted, we're excited about the announcement of the spin. But as circumstances change or anything comes to light, we would certainly have to consider that because we are interested in maximizing shareholder value. Yes. Look, as we talked in the prepared remarks, as we look at the 2 businesses and we talk about 2022 kind of pro forma, if we had done something, we had a 12% margin for the People & Places business, operating profit margin and about 8% for CMS. We think that our spend will ultimately allow the 2 incremental individual companies to focus on their respective opportunities and in a manner that allows for, if anything, an acceleration in growth. I do would like to say that in the event that the spin is able to be executed, we are -- we do realize that there will be some incremental CMS public company costs that would have to be incurred but we will think we'll be able to offset and then some with our opportunities to streamline our 2 organizations. Well, look, I think that we are continuing to invest in what we think is a great opportunity to enable divergent actually People & Places and PA to benefit from some of the overall investments being made in digital data capabilities for the total Jacobs. And so those investments continue because we believe there is strong rationale for a very large return relative to that. So we're not making any choices relative to those investments. We continue to make them and we're confident in the ability that the scale is growing as it did in the quarter and how we've communicated a sequential growth in terms of the top line which will translate into a growth leverage factor that translates into margin improvement. As we highlighted in our pared remarks. Nothing has changed. We feel good about that. We see visibility forward to be able to do that. So investments continue. And our growth is going to allow for us to get to the margin profile that we've communicated. Yes. Look, clearly, as we look going forward, I think there's a couple of things to highlight. Certainly, we've got inflationary pressure on the medical cost. And ultimately, we're going to be able to pass that along to our clients. But in the short term, certainly, we're seeing some pressure in that. We saw it in the first quarter. First quarter is, as you know, the last year of our medical plan. So we wanted to get a better read on our second quarter which now is in the next plan year. We continue to see that occurring in Q2. So we're projecting that, that's going to continue through the full year. So assuming that, that didn't happen, that obviously would be a positive. But right now, that's what our expectations are. Our interest rates obviously are higher year-over-year. And we think we're at hopefully, the top end of kind of what the interest rate scenarios are going to look like and that, if anything, we're going to be able to trend down. If that happens, we're not counting on it but certainly, that would allow for us to be able to have some incremental performance in our EPS figures as well. I think the underlying business is actually quite strong. And so absent some of these dynamics, I think putting it into context, we don't really see a situation where our business is slowing. So look, I think that, clearly, we have in front of us, a lot of execution that is really imperative for us to do well against. Whether that be on our business or it be the actual execution of the spin of CMS. So that is clearly job number 1. Number 2 is, because of that, certainly, I think there is a relatively high bar right now from a financial people, gross margin perspective as it relates to actually deploying additional capital in the M&A. Never say never but we think the bar is pretty high at this particular moment. So having said all of that, there certainly is opportunities to invest back in our shares as appropriate. And I think that you might want to think about that potentially happening over the course of the next several months. No. Look, it is certainly a process, both internal but also external. So as you may be aware, the process of putting in place a structure and an organization that facilitates an ability on day 1 to execute and manage a publicly traded company is not inconsequential. And so we're not going to rush that process. And I think 12 to 18 months is actually a fairly aggressive stance in some respects. So I don't think we're going to be able -- if, in fact, it continues to be oriented around the spend to do much better than that. But occurs, we'll do whatever we can to accelerate for sure. So 1 thing, just to crystallize and make sure that you caught it correctly. Our margins in CMS Q1. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So we're early in our process, Chad. We do know that People & Places and CMS both have good cash flow characteristics. Actually, People & Places has a lower DSO level than the current CMS organization. So we're working through all of that. We'll provide incremental details relative to when we get to that space to really give greater clarity. But I think you're going to see both businesses being robust in terms of their cash flow capabilities longer term. I would say that we think -- we're thinking longer term that there's no cap ultimately at the 20% level. So we'll work to continue to drive with the management team and ability to get back to margins that are north of 20% longer term. So we've evaluated all the opportunities. And depending upon if you were to do some type of other structure, we'll ultimately determine what the tax basis is. But clearly, if we did some type of other transaction, there would be some tax implications that would occur. So the fact that we've centered around executing against spend is a tax-efficient way of addressing the opportunity to create 2 separate very strong companies. And so look, I think that's how we're executing. That's our plan at this particular point in time. It takes a little bit of time given some of the discussions that we've had in the past. But that's 1 of the reasons that we consider the spin to be a highly attractive option. But as we go through the process and determine if we get any additional facts or circumstances that could change that, we'll consider that because we are ultimately interested in ensuring that we maximize shareholder value. So look, I'll make my first comment in response to your detailed questions is we remain committed to the Jacobs RemainCo that it's going to be investment-grade rating. So I think that gives you a ground post that you can certainly evaluate what the potential options may or may not look like. The second thing I would say is we're a little bit too early in the process. We have kept this to a very small group of executives and team members up until this point in time. And now we are -- as we publicly announced, we're going to go through a very detailed, thoughtful, disciplined process that will answer all of these questions. I do think that the way we would characterize the leverage factors, they're going to be appropriate relative to the businesses in which they are. So I think I'll just leave it there and I think you can interpret what that may or may not mean. But we think ultimately that there is an ability to have a stand-alone organization that will -- that is now CMS which is going to be -- have an ability to be quite successful longer term and people in places and PA and divergent as well as the RemainCo. Well, look, we didn't really comment about CMS, although I think what I would focus on in CMS is really more about the margin, sequential improvement which we think is really important as we get the business back to that level of 8% for the full year which is what we characterized. And so perhaps I'll leave it there because we didn't really talk about the CMS numbers; still growing."

            "name": "Robert Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan and thank all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Jacobs has a story of 75-year history of delivering value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We have consistently strived to improve our company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio to capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent markets. Turning to Slide 4. Today's announcement marks a key inflection point as we progress on our journey of continuous improvement and value creation. This morning, Jacobs announced our intent to separate our Critical Mission Solutions business through a spin-off. The decision to separate CMS is a result of a comprehensive review and evaluation to identify opportunities that streamline our portfolio and maximize strategic focus and potential growth opportunities for both future companies. We will sharpen both companies focus on their distinct strategies and operational initiatives that are most relevant to the specific industries in which they operate. Each company will have a tailored capital allocation and structure that is directed towards their respective growth strategies as well as a strength and ability to attract and retain top talent. Moving forward, in addition to our industry-leading position in core sectors, Jacobs will be a higher growth, higher margin, technology-enabled solutions provider continuing to address the world's most complex critical infrastructure and sustainability challenges. Jacobs's core skill sets in technical and consulting services, coupled with data science and technology-enabled expertise will continue to differentiate us from our peers and allow us to provide end-to-end solutions to our global clients. Our streamlined portfolio will include leading positions in critical infrastructure such as water and environment, energy transition, transportation and the advanced manufacturing sectors. Once the separation is complete, we can focus our attention on building additional capabilities and expertise that matter most to our clients in these areas. And importantly, we'll achieve even greater alignment with our 3 key accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. The new CMS will be a leading pure play government services company that provides technical consulting, applied science research, training, intelligent asset management and program management services to federal government agencies. CMS generated approximately $4.4 billion in FY '22 revenue. Today's announcement is another step in Jacobs' long record of taking bold actions to drive value creation and position our company for an even stronger future. And as we grow and thrive, our partners can achieve more as well. I want to emphasize that this announcement does not change how we work with our clients. As we work towards the separation, it will be business as usual. We remain committed to delivering world-class service to our clients, who will be able to rely on our people they know and trust. Turning to Slide 5. The proposed capital structure, governance and other matters relating to the separation will be communicated at a later date. Subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, we are targeting to complete the separation in the second half of fiscal year 2024 through a distribution that is intended to be tax free to Jacobs shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Turning to Slide 6. I want to reinforce the importance of our inclusive and forward-thinking culture. Last quarter, we reinforced our commitment to inclusion and diversity by including a gender quality KPI in our sustainability linked bond. Jacobs remains categorically committed to this goal. Turning to Q2 on Slide number 7. I want to thank our more than 60,000 global teammates for delivering a record second quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our underlying business remains strong and we continue to drive growth organically. We continue to invest behind and grow share in all key areas of focus against our 3 needle-moving growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. Our People & Places line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 7% year-on-year, 10% in constant currency and operating profit up 21% year-over-year, 25% in constant currency. Our pipeline and gross margin in backlog increased further supported by strong legislative drivers materializing in federal, state and local initiatives. CMS remains a stable base of recurring revenue driven primarily this quarter by the NASA Kennedy rebid award. CMS Q2 revenue was 11% higher than the previous quarter and 5% higher year-over-year. In terms of bookings this quarter, CMS also achieved an impressive overall win rate and the outlook for FY '23 continues to look strong with its pipeline up double digits year-over-year. We continue to invest behind CMS opening our Japan office during Q2, our first organic office opening since 2004. PA Consulting sales and backlog again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and utilities and defense sectors demonstrating momentum and consistency. I'm pleased to see margins improved in the quarter to over 20%, supported by milestone incentive achievement. PA continues to benefit from increased opportunities in Europe. For example, PA won a mandate for a private Scandinavian renewable energy company that is currently active in renewable electricity generation and storage. PA is working with the client to create a market entry strategy across offshore and onshore wind in several new European markets. Our divergent solutions operating unit had a strong operating profit quarter with operating profit up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we extended our collaboration with Palantir across multiple infrastructure applications. Kevin will give more detail in his comments. Looking across the broader market environment, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for growth in climate response and energy and environment. For example, our approximately $2 billion water business continues to exceed expectations and reinforce our position in the water sector. Water continues to be a pacesetter with pipeline growth up materially year-over-year. During Q2, we were awarded the Donald advanced water purification facility by the LA Bureau Sanitation, 1 of the largest reuse projects in the U.S. delivering a more sustainable drinking water source in a drought stressed region. Fittingly, we would like to call attention to drinking water week, an opportunity to proudly celebrate the work we do with utility partners to provide safe drinking water to millions of people around the world. Our cities and places pipeline also grew double digits, including key wins in the Middle East, where we are working to reimagine urban development addressing major environmental and quality of life challenges and predominantly powered by clean energy. Globally, we are seeing significant energy transition opportunities. Last month, we efficiently launched a dedicated business unit in PMPS to focus on significant opportunities in global energy transition to accelerate growth and address the ever-expanding needs of our clients. Turning to Slide 8. During Q2, we were awarded the Gold Medal Award for International Corporate Achievement and Sustainable Development by the World Environment Center, a nongovernmental organization advancing sustainable development through corporate business practices. Their annual Gold Medal Award recognizes 1 international company demonstrating a global vision and a commitment to sustainable development through innovative applications of policies, economic, environmental and social responsibilities. The independent jury commended our thoughtful approach to sustainability, combining commitments with global initiatives and partnerships with positive and far-reaching impact. Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we remain well positioned with our industry-leading ranking across multiple sectors. This is particularly evident in our advanced manufacturing business, where our long-term pipeline increased double digits year-over-year. Further, in our infrastructure business, legislative actions continue to provide visible growth opportunities despite continued political debate on broader topics. For example, recent wins this quarter include 3 significant intelligent O&M programs in California, Florida and Louisiana which we secured through strong differentiation with the use of our digitally enabled platform. We expect operating profit growth to outpace organic top line increases as we remain focused on quality of backlog. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives and narrow our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. Finally, with today's announcement, we are reinforcing our continuous commitment to take proactive actions to create greater shareholder value as well as strategic and value-creating benefits for both future companies and their respective stakeholders. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Okay. So maybe I'll start off and then Kevin, I'll turn it over to you. With regards to the second part first, Jamie, we do not see dissynergies with the spin. On the spin, specifically, we were looking for the most optimal tax-free benefit for our shareholders as well as our confidence in the business that it has the credibility and the horsepower to operate successfully as an independent entity. So those were kind of the drivers we're looking to obviously maximize shareholder value. Kevin, anything you want to add? Yes. Maybe I'll answer the first part and then you talk about margin targets, Kevin. So as far as our growth expectations for the business, they're very strong and in line with what we articulated in our '22 strategy for the segment reporting. So we feel that pipeline as well as the opportunities in front of us with the platform that we have, looks very, very bright for the RemainCo post spin. Kevin, you want to add anything? Let me answer the backlog growth. Right now, the way our pipeline is lining up, Andy, the answer is yes. We do see consistent opportunity to increase our backlog and grow the business. Part of the 10% constant currency growth on the top line, I think that's going to be dependent on the phasing of the jobs, how these jobs come out, especially on the infrastructure side as well as in our private sector business those early phases of the job tend to be more study and higher-end consulting work. And then as we move through subset phases, kind of where the larger the revenue opportunities are. So I wouldn't want to go and say that that's going to be a consistent quarterly topic but definitely a target if you were to aggregate over a period of time. Actually, we see the backlog potential in CMS being strong. The pipeline of work that we have and not just the rebid but the new work that's coming down the pike they provide some real opportunity for us to continue that backlog growth. So we feel confident about that. Yes, Michael, just to clarify 1 point. We didn't -- actually 5G and automotive are a part of the CMS segment and that's actually what we were reporting today. So I just want to clarify that point. I would say as far as what stays, what goes, we're early in that process. And so to be direct and to provide clarity, it is the CMS segment today. No, we're not. We're not. And so I just want to provide clarity on that. Yes. So on the margins themselves, I mean, I think clearly, it's been a part of our strategy for not just '22 but '19 as well. We are in -- we continue to going up the value chain for our clients. And as we do that and we're getting more into the higher-end consultancy work, we're seeing the incremental effect on our booked margin as far as how that's dropping into the bottom line, I think 2 parts, Michael, that you're highlighting. One is that kind of excellence in project delivery which has been a part of our DNA for decades, that continues to be high on our list on delivering not only to our clients' expectation but within our financial expectation as we're booking these shops. As far as the last part of your question on the timing of that dropping to the bottom line. We're seeing a nice pace in the marketplace. And this kind of goes to all segments of our business. After a period of time, I think, in the beginning of Q1 and maybe in the back half of last year, that was having an effect on our top line and some of our actuals to forecast, that is reconciled back and hence, the performance this quarter. And so all indications that we're getting from our clients is that's going to continue. Yes, Sean, we're constantly looking at our portfolio and doing an evaluation on how we're executing externally with our clients and the effect that, that is having on advancing our strategy. So is it -- to reflect back on what we -- where we were before. I don't think we're doing anything that's different from what we articulated in our strategy. And so we feel confident in the decision that we made today. Kevin, why don't you start off from a market standpoint, I'll talk after that. Well said. Not going to add any comment. Kevin? Yes. Just wanted to add -- we really like what we got. Yes, Steve, a couple of things. One is that we were pretty clear last quarter that on the quarter-to-quarter or at least Q1, that had some project incentive releases that were onetime. As far -- so another way of saying we need to really take a look at the year-over-year comparisons. And then the -- for all of us to be aware that we put margin targets out at our Strategy Day. And just to do kind of a midterm report on that, we are actually a year ahead of where we said we were going to be on our margin profile. So that's a -- look at it over the period of time, so I hope that clarifies that. And as far as that continuing, Steve, I missed 1 part of your question. As far as that continuing, we evaluate based on our clients and trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And as we said in the script, those have been very, very strong in the P&PS world. So we continue to have confidence in our business. And Chad, on the second part that you asked about the capabilities, we feel strong that we've got a strong platform. We feel strongly that we've got a really solid platform today. In areas where we continue to innovate is around our digital platforms and our digital enablement and the partnership that we have with Palantir and with others, that is that's -- those are strong platforms in order to grow without making huge investments. So we're really comfortable where we sit today. So Michael, the short answer is no. IIJA, that's where we made specific commentary about that in the script, has really started to incrementalize in our business and we can see it not only in our pipeline but in our bookings. And it's realizing itself in that was -- it's why we specifically called out P&PS Americas on the 30% year-over-year growth. So we're not seeing that at all. And just 1 other -- just a clarifying point on IIJA, it's a law, right? So as far as it being repealed, there would have to be significant -- there have be a new law. And so we feel confident about that. On some of these other items, those were actually in the early stages and we had not even -- we had not seen the effects of those in our pipeline or in our work. So the fact that there's a debate about those now, it's not really having that material effect on the business. Yes. Interesting, I kind of separated between PA and P&PS. Our PA business in the U.K. specifically is actually growing and it's been really, really strong. And that's kind of a testament to no different than Jacobs historically, real strong capabilities in those areas of global priorities and national priorities and it's around the defense sector that PA has a strong relationship with MOD as well as in energy and utilities which, in fact, is turning into a security issue in broader Europe. So that's really driving the PA business. What's driving the PA and the P&PS business is the energy security issue in the broader Continental Europe as well as in Scandinavia. And I'll give you just 1 statistic. 1 year ago, 2 years ago, of our U.K. platform which you know is really, really strong, about 90% of our folks that were based in the U.K., worked in U.K. business. Today, that's about 60-40 is where we have our talent from the U.K. working on programs and projects and engagements all throughout Europe as well as globally. And that goes into -- Kevin and I have been really vocal about that over the course of the last 3 or 4 years about tying that global talent. So it doesn't totally dampen the effect of some of the economic headwinds in Europe but our diversity is helping in that front. Yes. So Gautam, it's Bob. One of the things that -- we looked at this really, really hard. And as far as the dissynergies go, we feel pretty confident that, that's not going to be of any materiality at all. Now that said, similar to what we've done in the past, our relationship post spin with CMS is going to continue to be very strong. And so our ability to work together, collaborate and partner for the benefit of our client is going to continue to be there. So that's always going to be there. In fact, we've demonstrated that in our history with a previous divestiture that we did and that relationship continues to this date to be very, very strong. On the PA outside of the U.K., really that entrance into the U.S. which we're in real time and having success on was around the private sector in the U.S., not the government sector and more specifically around energy and utilities and health and life sciences. And those opportunities have continued In fact, today, in the U.S., we have probably 50 active pursuits with a lot of cases, bids in play with PA and we're feeling really confident about that. Yes, thank you. It's exciting times ahead. We're really looking forward to what the future brings. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call and we'll be very close to the market continue -- as things continue to develop and progress. Thank you, everyone."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Solutions Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations, you may begin.\nJonathan Doros: Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our Web site, which we will reference during the call. I'd like to refer you to Slide 2 of this presentation materials for information about our forward-looking statements and non- GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined today by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by summarizing highlights from our first quarter results, discuss our commitment to sustainability and then provide an update on our strategy. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. In the appendix of the presentation, we provide additional ESG related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it on to Bob Borgata, CEO.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, John. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Starting on Slide 4. I'd like to welcome to the call, Claudia Jaramillo, who is currently our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. We recently announced her transition to CFO later this year. I'm excited to now lead Jacobs as CEO. Over the last several years, we have repositioned the company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio and capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent sectors. At this juncture in our strategy, strong execution and focus is pivotal to our success. There are three key priorities, first, we will maintain our inclusive and inspirational culture that fosters the creativity needed to live by our mission, challenges today reinventing tomorrow. Second, we will focus on driving a higher structural growth rate across our core sectors by executing against the three needle moving growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory across the entire organization and sectors we serve. While we are in a leading position to capitalize on the mega trends and structural tailwinds, our relentless focus on long term client relationships is driving sustained growth. Third, we will deliver long term returns for our shareholders by driving further operational discipline across the business to accelerate cash flow generation with disciplined capital allocation. From a financial standpoint, our underlying business remains strong. Our People & Places Solutions line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 8% year-over-year, 13% in constant currency, operating profit up 20% year-over-year, 28% in constant currency, and we continue to gain market share in both the global critical infrastructure and advanced facility sectors. In CMS, we continue to deliver a strong base of recurring revenue with a growing new business pipeline. We anticipate strong tailwinds and backlog growth with CMS moving forward. PA Consulting experienced lower than expected utilization, but we continue to experience double digit top line and backlog growth. We are seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in PA sales pipeline. The number of recent wins underscores our strategy and demonstrates our move of the value chain with our clients to higher margin consulting and advisory services. Across the company, we see exciting opportunities ahead of us, specifically in the areas of climate response and especially in energy transition. Our ability to deliver data enabled solutions is enhancing our clients\u2019 resilience and sustainability. The establishment of Divergent Solutions enables Jacobs to scale and deploy our domain centric data platforms across multiple sectors and geographies, further enabling us to deliver solutions to typically complex challenges. I will talk to these key themes further in the presentation. Turning to Slide 5. We remain steadfastly committed to our cultural transformation to create an inspirational journey for all. In 2015, we started our culture journey with the empowerment and accountability, incorporating inclusion, innovation and inspiration into the very fabric of the company. I believe our emphasis on inclusion and diversity has been a critically important contributor to our success and provides a key differentiator in attracting and retaining the world's best talent as well as driving innovation for our clients. A key benefit of being a company with a broad range of capabilities is our ability to provide multiple career and development opportunities, what we refer to as agile careers. When we learn and grow together, we activate empowerment and accountability, inclusion and diversity and innovation. We lead, embrace and anticipate change. To further demonstrate our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we have included a KPI in the refinancing of our credit facilities linked to female leadership representation. Kevin will discuss further details in his remarks. Turning to Slide 6. Our commitment to sustainability is core to our strategy and our significant performance is being recognized by many of the top ESG accredited institutions. Over the past five years, we have advanced to an industry leading status. This culminated in our inclusion into 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, ranking Jacobs among the world's leading companies with outstanding sustainability performance. While the scores themselves are impressive, what's even more significant is the public recognition of Jacobs' positive impact on our clients, communities and the world. As we turn to Slide 7, we will focus on our 4 key growth sectors of critical infrastructure, energy and environment, advanced facilities and national security. These growth sectors are are driven by the following catalysts: federal government stimulus from the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, supply chain and technology investments in advanced facilities and the emergence of increased global threats. Let's examine the legislative drivers first and our positioning in the market. I am proud that Jacobs has helped our clients secure over $1 billion in IIJA competitive grants since its patent, and the bill is only in its early stages. We supported our clients in securing over $350 million in IIJA competitive grant funding just last quarter, the largest quarter since the passing of the act. This includes the largest grant awarded nationwide for subway station accessibility in New York City, a major port infrastructure development grant to a long term client in Alaska, the first phase award of one of the largest water treatment plants in the US and the design of a sustainable battery recycling facility. With another four years of locked in and robust funding the US infrastructure climate is strong. The coming months will also bring the first dollars of two other areas of focus for Jacobs. The inflation Reduction Act with $369 billion to fund the Green Economy transition and the CHIPS Act for semiconductor investment, all in core Jacob sectors. Before the end of the calendar year, we fully expect to have all three bills firing at full strength and funding critical projects sponsored by local governments, the federal government and the semiconductor industry. This overlap of spending will continue for four or five consecutive fiscal quarters and drive growth across the infrastructure and energy markets. In advanced facilities, we continue to see sustained capital investment in the semiconductor manufacturing space, biotechnology capacity expansions and the electric vehicle ecosystem, all being driven by reshaping of global supply chains, technology advancements and decarbonization efforts. Turning to Slide 8. As evidenced by double digit pipeline growth in each of these sectors, our industry position continues to grow, and we see this being a long term secular trend. In addition to previously discussed infrastructure wins, we have been awarded major programs in the semiconductor space to include greenfield expansions in the US and Europe for a global chip manufacturer. In the biotechnology sector, we have won multiple expansions in the US, Europe and Asia, and we continue to see global growth in electric vehicle ecosystem driven by a favorable regulatory environment with project wins for battery and vehicle manufacturing and charging infrastructure in the US and Europe. Within National Security, we are seeing increased defense spending in the US, UK and Australia due to continued global threat. As highlighted as a future prospect last quarter, in the US, we were successful in winning a critical Cyber Intelligence Award for $469 million, five year contract for a classified defense customer to provide secure data and network solutions globally. In the UK, PA is leading the consortium that has been selected by the MoD to deliver Crenic, a future force protection electronic countermeasures program. It will provide the next generation of innovative solutions to counter the threat posed by radio controlled and provides explosive devices, otherwise known as IEDs. And in Australia, we are supporting the acquisition and sustainment of military platforms for the Australian Defense Department, which has engaged Jacobs with increasing volumes of work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. Let's turn to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our first quarter results. First quarter gross revenue grew 12% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Net revenue grew 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, an acceleration from our fiscal year 2022 constant currency growth of 8%. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26%, sequentially in line with the fourth quarter, but as expected, was down approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by: one, the remaining year-over-year impact of the Idaho remediation contract; and two, lower utilization and NPA consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Both People & Places Solutions and Divergent Solutions gross margins were flat year-over-year. We expect total gross margins to remain plus or minus 26% of net revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year and trending higher as we exit the year from a higher margin mix of revenue and new higher margin opportunities from our growth accelerators. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.5%, slightly higher than Q4 but down 130 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from lower employee benefit costs, which were mostly offset by miscellaneous other cost. During the remainder of the fiscal year, we plan to make additional investments in employee welfare programs such as higher 401(k) match and improved medical benefits as part of our continued investment in improving our culture and employee engagement. These costs are factored into our full year outlook. As a result, we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $238 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $28 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future of work strategy and finally, other acquisition deal related costs and restructuring efforts of $17 million. Actual restructuring costs were less than half of these costs and supported the creation of our new Divergent Solutions reporting segment. The remaining costs are largely related to PA noncash contingent equity based agreements associated with our PA transaction structure. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 8% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 15% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect $15 million of restructuring charges for the full year fiscal year 2023. We also expect another $30 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of Q2 and Q3 as we further execute our future work strategy. Finally, we expect approximately $20 million of transaction related expenses from deal related integration and other costs, most of which is performance based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions. It also includes the noncash contingent based equity associated with our PA transaction structure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, flat year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.07 per share and included a $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles a $0.16 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, a $0.09 adjustment to align to our projected annual tax rate and a $0.09 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.67, up 7% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $339 million and was up 9% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 1% year- over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 times with our gross margin in backlog as a percentage of net revenue up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching NASA -- Kennedy NASA rebid as the project's backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q1. Before delving into the details by segment, I would like to make some overall comments regarding the strength and diversity of Jacobs portfolio. As you all know, all aspects of our portfolio are aligned with long term secular growth trends. Our results in the quarter exhibit the strength of this diversity and its ability to deliver strong consistent operating profit growth. In this quarter, our People & Places Solutions business led the way. So let's start with them. Overall, People & Places delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends that Bob discussed earlier. Q1 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency. All business units contributed solid and often very strong constant currency growth. Backlog grew 2% year-over-year and gross margin and backlog was up double digits in constant currency with a book-to-bill greater than 1. Total People & Places Solutions Q1 gross margins were flat year-over-year, with Q1 operating profit up 20% and 28% in constant currency. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 14.5%, up over 140 basis points year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and a disciplined management of overhead costs. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit and margin, resulting in strong double digit growth in full year operating profit. Our Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted the strongest double digit revenue and operating profit growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients, and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients, which comprise two thirds of our People & Places business. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our advanced facilities growth rate to remain strong during fiscal year 2023 despite the very solid and strong 2022 year-over-year comparisons. Our Americas unit had an outstanding quarter with over 20% year-over-year operating profit growth, driven by infrastructure related monetization wins beginning to convert to revenue. The backlog and sales pipeline provides us confidence as we are seeing many large programs mature for a late 2023 or early 2024 award, which should continue to support longer term momentum. Our international business, Q1 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year on a reported basis but grew double digits in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during Q2 and with FX neutralizing over the second half of our fiscal year, assuming no large variation from existing current foreign exchange rates. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to national security, space exploration and energy transition priorities mainly in the US, Europe and Australia as well as infrastructure monetization solutions such as US 5G telecom investments. Q1 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency, driven by the Idaho nuclear remediation project contract that ramped up in Q2 of last year. For the remainder of fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits for the CMS business as we now compare to quarters that include the Idaho project. CMS book to bill was just over 1 times and continues to be impacted by the approaching NASA Kennedy rebid, which we expect to be awarded soon. Gross profit margins were down year-over-year due to the revenue mix impact from the lower margin remediation project and the year ago closeout benefits associated with our strong performance on several enterprise contracts. CMS operating profit was $82 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was in line with expectations and was down 170 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, but up 60 basis points sequentially from the Q4 figure. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023 with the ability to expand margins as we can convert higher margin opportunities in our sales pipeline. Moving to Divergent Solutions. Gross revenue was up 11% year-over-year. And when excluding the impact from pass-throughs, net revenue increased 7% year-over-year. We expect net revenue growth to accelerate materially in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings. Gross margins in Divergent are in line with our consolidated gross margin, which we believe provides us the ability to significantly expand DVS operating margins as we gain additional scale from our heightened growth investments. Operating profit margins were 6%, driven by early stage investments and well below our future run rate projections for this business as we begin to embed integrated [data] enabled offerings in our core markets. We expect Divergent to finish fiscal 2023 with margins approaching double digits. Turning to PA Consulting. The translation impact from a stronger US dollar from the year ago period continued to impact reported revenue and operating profit growth. Revenue from PA was down 3% year-over-year in US dollars but up over 11% in British pounds. PA had a solid book-to-bill of over 1 times. We expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during fiscal year 2023. Turning to profitability. During fiscal year 2022, PA aggressively hired ahead of an increasing demand from strong secular growth opportunities across energy transition, sustainable consumer goods and strategic and digital transformation opportunities. While the sales pipeline remains robust and backlog continues to grow, the delayed conversion of these opportunities into burn continues to impact utilization. As a result, Q1 operating profit margins were 18%. While actions have been taken to significantly improve utilization, we expect margins to improve incrementally approaching 20% as we exit the fiscal year. Our nonallocated corporate costs were $40 million, down year-over-year as we made a strategic decision to move to a more flexible paid time off program in the US and invest further enhanced employee welfare plans, including improved medical, 401(k) match benefits and parental leave offerings. We believe this strategic decision is key to further strengthening our culture and attracting and retaining world class talent. While Q1 was lower than our previous quarter run rate guidance, we do expect that our corporate costs for the year will increase to our previous estimate of $190 million to $210 million. And we are monitoring our medical and other fringe costs closely which can vary depending upon our revenue and delivery mix as well as seasonality of medical claims. Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $270 million and included an outflow of $60 million for payment of the CARES Act deferral benefit of payroll taxes and $6 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding the unusual payment associated with the CARES Act, our underlying free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $330 million. In the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to approximate the year ago figure driven by the very strong Q1 performance. For the full year, we continue to anticipate 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we repurchased approximately $140 million of share during the quarter. As we previously have discussed -- as we previously announced, the Board of Directors has also approved a new three year $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares if we see price dislocation in our relative valuation. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulting in $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q1 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. And given our commitment to inclusion and diversity, all of Jacobs bank debt now has a sustainability linked KPR target of achieving a 40% female representation in our management team as defined as our Vice President and above population. As of the end of Q1, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, which includes our $500 million notional interest rate lock of 2.7%. As of the first quarter, our weighted average interest cost was 4.6%. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on March 24th. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12. Our portfolio is positioned to benefit from multiple secular growth trends across our core sectors with the opportunity to structurally increase our long term earnings power by executing against our growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. We reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.20 to $7.50, which incorporates recent FX rates. In closing, I would like to reiterate my priorities as CEO to maintain an inspirational and inclusive culture that will capitalize on our growth accelerators and drive long term returns for our shareholders. Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere condolences on behalf of Jacobs to all those affected by the terrible earthquakes that occurred in Turkey and Syria earlier this week. Our employees have yet again demonstrated a culture of caring and practice by raising their hands to seek ways to support those most impacted by this tragedy. I'm proud to lead a company that rises to the calling in such challenging circumstances. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Bubes: This is Adam Bubes on for Jerry Revich today. Now that your leverage ratio has declined. Can you provide an update on the M&A pipeline, and if you'd care to comment on opportunity set by line of business?\nBob Pragada: Go ahead, Kevin.\nKevin Berryman: So look, I think the M&A pipeline, we have a list of opportunities at every single point in time. There are things that are of interest. But ultimately, I would suggest to you that we really have nothing to comment on other than we do believe there's some things that are aligned with our strategy. And remember, how we think about our deployment of capital against M&A is to be aligned with our accelerators. So it's climate response, that's data consulting, data solutions and data -- consulting and advisory. So those are the areas we're continuing to focus on. And certainly, given the strong cash flow that we continue to generate, we'll have degrees of freedom to deploy that capital as appropriate when we see value added opportunities.\nOperator: The next question is from Andy Wittmann with Baird.\nAndy Wittmann: Kevin, I guess I just wanted to dig in a little bit to some of the comments you made about I guess, some of the adjustments here. So you previously said $15 million of restructuring. You reiterated that again, obviously noting some real estate impairments that are noncash. But I guess here you took an exclusion on Focus 2023 expenses. I guess I wasn't expecting that. Could you talk about what that was in the quarter, what you're hoping to achieve with that? And maybe what the expectation or the budget is for the year, if there are going to be any further Focus 2023 expenses?\nKevin Berryman: The focus 2023 to the extent that there is any indications that are really related to the real estate impairment. It's part of our overall Focus 2023 initiative. So it's not over and above the kind of real estate impairments that I highlighted.\nAndy Wittmann: Might have been viewed as future of work\u2026\nKevin Berryman: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Bob, you talked about your drivers, the key drivers in the end markets and how they will be impacted. How comfortable do you feel as you're taking over here how you're positioned from a resource basis to drive that growth, what areas there\u2019d be more tension paid upon? And of the several different end markets that you see, you did touch on some of them in your prepared remarks. But what ones could we expect to see some more better growth, better opportunities for Jacobs not only just to increase the book your bookings, but also drive the higher margin mix that you're anticipating?\nBob Pragada: From a resources standpoint, Michael, I'd say that we're feeling comfortable. And really, it goes back to what we've talked about previously. Our use of global talent has really balanced our ability to deliver on our clients\u2019 expectations. So it's not where the capital is being deployed. It doesn't necessarily map to where we source talent and deliver the solutions that were expected and can deliver. So we're really positive about the resources front. As far as of the areas that we're looking at, I'd say that specifically in infrastructure and even more specifically in energy transition is providing some real overextended growth opportunities. And that was very evident this quarter in our growth in pipeline, I talked about double digit composite for the entirety of our insectors, the highest was energy transition. And we've got a great base, great talent, great solutions and with work that we've already been doing in the renewable space for quite a while, it's serving us well.\nOperator: The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Bob, you mentioned four years of locked in funding for IIJ and that you expected funding from IIJ, IRA and the CHIPS Act to be a strong run rate by the end of the calendar year. Maybe you can give us a little more color regarding what that could mean for PPS NSR. You're already growing NSR at 8%. So does it mean you could trend higher than that, and is there any risk that DC related budget noise can impact the infrastructure ramp up?\nBob Pragada: So let me answer the last part first. I think that the infrastructure ramp up is pretty locked in with regards to IIJ. And then the effects that the IRA and the CHIPS Act will be supplemental to that. My comment about the end of the year is that those three will be in real time. So we're feeling comfortable about that four year time line. I think what's also important to understand is that when we -- the difference between the appropriation, the deployment of the funds and capital and then the duration of the projects, programs and engagements, that has a tail on it that's six to seven years. And so you see -- Kevin talked about the backlog growth in revenue being kind of in that mid single digits, but the gross margin being in double digits on a constant currency basis, that's really a function of where we are in the phasing of that work. So comfortable on that front. As far as could that mean incremental growth to what we've already projected in our out year plan, we're feeling strongly that it could really be a big part of the company. So we're optimistic.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Jamie. So on CMS, I was wondering if you continue to expect low to mid 8% margins for the year? And is there any opportunity to look at divesting underperforming or noncore businesses in CMS and focus more on higher margin businesses, in particular, now with Claudia on board.\nKevin Berryman: So look, I think we are a proactive team that always evaluates what we believe is the right portfolio for our company, both now and into the future. We've proven that by the divestiture that we executed against in 2019 with the sale of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business, which one could argue was actually the legacy of the company. So we are always proactive in that consideration. So I'll leave it there. And so we can't really comment on anything other than, look, we always consider the opportunities. As it relates to CMS, we do believe that they are going to be able to get up into the 8% margins over the course of the year. So we see improving, they're at a point in time where some of the wins that they've had, which are a little bit higher margin are yet to kind of get into the burn. And we would expect that, that will be happening over the course of the balance of the year.\nBob Pragada: If I could add just one item to what Kevin said. When we talk about energy transition, please keep in mind that, that includes components of CMS that\u2019s around our our nuclear new build and the AMR SMR technologies that we have, and we're seeing some real opportunities and growth in Europe that will be contributing to the margin profile that Kevin mentioned.\nKevin Berryman: And just to clarify as well, when we talk about the future, I think we're approaching 8% for the year, which means because we started at the level we are, we're going to have to be having in subsequent quarters margins that are going to be above 8%.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: On the potential DC lockdown or just headlines around a prolonged continuing resolution. Just Maybe, Kevin, you kind of walk through on -- I know we talked on IIJ, but even on the CMS side, anything that we should be aware of that could lead to orders being pushed out, rebid being pushed out? Are you hearing any of that based on some of the headlines we're seeing down in DC?\nBob Pragada: Go ahead, and then I'll back you up.\nKevin Berryman: Look, I think the bottom line is we have an Omnibus in place for 2023. So what we're really fundamentally talking about is a continuing resolution for 2024. Look, it remains to be seen how that plays out. Clearly, there's some differences of opinion in the house right now relative to where we may end up. I would say the good news is relative to this, if there is good news, is that we're kind of based off a strong Omnibus program in 2023, it could impact new items getting funded, but we're based on a 23% kind of level, which is pretty straightforward. As it relates to the disruption relative to the debt and whatnot, we think our view is they\u2019ll come to some rational conclusion on that, but we'll see how that plays out.\nBob Pragada: And right now, the programs, Michael, that we're looking at are not totally insulated, but we've got a strong view on those programs being funded here in the near term -- awarded.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Connors with Stifel.\nRobert Conners: Well, first off, Bob, if I remember correctly, I'm wishing your birds a good luck next weekend. And I guess for my question, you guys have a lot of tailwinds going into the back half, strong outlook on various end markets. Just sort of wondering what your thinking was with around sort of maintaining the guidance, especially with currency sort of being a tailwind here.\nKevin Berryman: Well, there's a couple of things that we have to recognize certainly exchange rates are a positive, but also we have incremental interest costs that are largely offsetting that. So there's gives and takes here. I think given the dynamic of how we're playing out in DC, I think we're being prudent relative to our guidance that we've provided. And look, there's gives and takes here. FX isn't the only one. I would say, certainly, interest is some headwinds that we're facing and then the business is kind of net off. And I think at the end of the day, we're I think, positioned for good results for the full year fiscal 2023.\nBob Pragada: And then, Robert, maybe I'll make a couple of comments on the markets. The reason why we highlighted those four sectors that we did is the tailwinds that we are seeing and it's materializing in the double digit pipeline growth, the backlog growth that we're seeing and our bookings performance, all leading indicators to strengthen those markets. The burn of those bookings is something we continue to monitor very closely. But the stage that we're coming in on those programs are creating a higher level of utilization, specifically in the US for the Jacobs business.\nOperator: The next question is from Louie DiPalma with William Blair.\nLouie DiPalma: Congrats to everyone on your promotions and new positions. As it relates to the exceptional strength for advanced facilities for this current fiscal 2023 on top of 2022, Kevin, I think you mentioned how this is [called on]. And I was wondering, should investors expect a consistent long term upward trajectory for advanced facilities with all of the stimulus funding from the CHIPS Act, or will it be lumpy in certain years as funding maybe inconsistent?\nBob Pragada: Louie, I think if you go back over a decade ago, that lumpiness was -- in the time between cycles, whether it be semi or in life sciences was a lot longer. We're seeing those cycles contract look at the current semi cycle as well. And so we think that, that long term growth aspect versus what we used to see a decade ago, we've demonstrated that the diversity of our portfolio has been able to really sustain that. You mentioned '22, it was also '21 as well. So we're feeling really positive there. The other item I would highlight is that it's the reason what's driving these growth catalysts, the reason why we highlighted the supply chain disruption as well as technology advancements is that in the past, the lumpiness was driven by demand. And so capacity was almost exclusively tied to demand and then you could just map it via economic cycles. Today, that has completely changed and the drivers are more driven around technology advancements, reshaping of supply chains from the east to the west as well as innovations that are happening in, whether it be chip design or novel therapy. So the drivers also give us that level of confidence too.\nOperator: The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about recompetes, besides the Kennedy contract over the next 18, 24 months, do you have any big ones coming up? And then just related to the continuing resolution risk around the budget next year, are there any programs that kind of new programs that -- in your prior guidance, you were counting on growing, but that might not be able to grow in such an environment? Anything that we should be thinking about as a potential headwinds in '24?\nBob Pragada: Maybe I'll talk first on the recompetes. Outside of Kennedy, for the next 12 to 18 months, I think that was the time line that you put it at nothing of that size. We have smaller recompetes that are probably a little less under the radar -- a little bit more under the radar. But those are well within the normal cycle of our business. On the CR with new programs, Gautam, that's one where we continue to be very sensitive to that. From a recompete standpoint, those could end up being upside for us, because we're on programs that are continuing to be determined. But I think the diversity of our portfolio has lessened the impact of what we saw historically with CRs. And so I think that's where -- I think it would not be wise of us to predict the effect of CRs. But I think the diversity is where we see the hedge and we feel confident about our business.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Just to follow up on that a little bit. As far as the NASA Kennedy rebid itself, given so many changes in the space industry and emergence of a lot of commercial space interest, where is your confidence in retaining the work?\nBob Pragada: Our confidence is solid. As whether it be NASA or other clients you could even outside the aerospace world, we've grown with our clients. So the intimacy that we have with the science of our clients\u2019 business has allowed us to be their long term advocate and long term partner. So wherever the space industry goes, a movement to commercial, which we're involved with or in other areas of exploration, we've been a part of that journey and a valued partner. So we're feeling confident.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Dillard with AB Bernstein.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Brandon on for Chad. Follow-up on CMS margins. You said that ending the year above 8% to give the full year to 8%. But given the high margin projects you all have been talking about, is it safe to assume that we can expect that exit rate to be the prevailing rate going forward and could the margins potentially approach People & Places levels given all these projects?\nKevin Berryman: That would certainly be consistent with our strategy. I would say the margin burn that I was referring to is second half oriented primarily. So as we look to beyond 2023, certainly consistent with our strategy, we are always looking for an incremental profit improvement in terms of margin. So yes, that would be consistent with our execution strategy.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Dwyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Dwyer: This is Alex on for Sean this morning. So my question, the backlog was very strong this quarter and it looks like all segments grew sequentially from 4Q. You guys had highlighted this gross margin in the backlog was up 100 basis points. Can you guys talk a little bit about what's driving this 100 basis point increase in margin? Is it one or two segments or is it more broad based in all the segments?\nBob Pragada: I'd say it's broad based. This is -- again, when we keep reiterating, moving up the value chain with our clients, these are higher higher level technically complex as well as digitally enabled offerings that we have now in the marketplace, which is driving that higher margin in our backlog. And so it's not acutely focused in a specific one area, it's across the board.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it over to the presenters for any closing remarks.\nBob Pragada: All right. Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. Looking forward to future calls and providing further updates on upcoming events and on our further calls. So thank you very much, and have a great week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Let's turn to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our first quarter results. First quarter gross revenue grew 12% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Net revenue grew 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, an acceleration from our fiscal year 2022 constant currency growth of 8%. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26%, sequentially in line with the fourth quarter, but as expected, was down approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by: one, the remaining year-over-year impact of the Idaho remediation contract; and two, lower utilization and NPA consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Both People & Places Solutions and Divergent Solutions gross margins were flat year-over-year. We expect total gross margins to remain plus or minus 26% of net revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year and trending higher as we exit the year from a higher margin mix of revenue and new higher margin opportunities from our growth accelerators. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.5%, slightly higher than Q4 but down 130 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from lower employee benefit costs, which were mostly offset by miscellaneous other cost. During the remainder of the fiscal year, we plan to make additional investments in employee welfare programs such as higher 401(k) match and improved medical benefits as part of our continued investment in improving our culture and employee engagement. These costs are factored into our full year outlook. As a result, we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $238 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $28 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future of work strategy and finally, other acquisition deal related costs and restructuring efforts of $17 million. Actual restructuring costs were less than half of these costs and supported the creation of our new Divergent Solutions reporting segment. The remaining costs are largely related to PA noncash contingent equity based agreements associated with our PA transaction structure. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 8% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 15% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect $15 million of restructuring charges for the full year fiscal year 2023. We also expect another $30 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of Q2 and Q3 as we further execute our future work strategy. Finally, we expect approximately $20 million of transaction related expenses from deal related integration and other costs, most of which is performance based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions. It also includes the noncash contingent based equity associated with our PA transaction structure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, flat year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.07 per share and included a $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles a $0.16 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, a $0.09 adjustment to align to our projected annual tax rate and a $0.09 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.67, up 7% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $339 million and was up 9% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 1% year- over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 times with our gross margin in backlog as a percentage of net revenue up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching NASA -- Kennedy NASA rebid as the project's backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q1. Before delving into the details by segment, I would like to make some overall comments regarding the strength and diversity of Jacobs portfolio. As you all know, all aspects of our portfolio are aligned with long term secular growth trends. Our results in the quarter exhibit the strength of this diversity and its ability to deliver strong consistent operating profit growth. In this quarter, our People & Places Solutions business led the way. So let's start with them. Overall, People & Places delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends that Bob discussed earlier. Q1 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency. All business units contributed solid and often very strong constant currency growth. Backlog grew 2% year-over-year and gross margin and backlog was up double digits in constant currency with a book-to-bill greater than 1. Total People & Places Solutions Q1 gross margins were flat year-over-year, with Q1 operating profit up 20% and 28% in constant currency. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 14.5%, up over 140 basis points year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and a disciplined management of overhead costs. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit and margin, resulting in strong double digit growth in full year operating profit. Our Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted the strongest double digit revenue and operating profit growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients, and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients, which comprise two thirds of our People & Places business. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our advanced facilities growth rate to remain strong during fiscal year 2023 despite the very solid and strong 2022 year-over-year comparisons. Our Americas unit had an outstanding quarter with over 20% year-over-year operating profit growth, driven by infrastructure related monetization wins beginning to convert to revenue. The backlog and sales pipeline provides us confidence as we are seeing many large programs mature for a late 2023 or early 2024 award, which should continue to support longer term momentum. Our international business, Q1 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year on a reported basis but grew double digits in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during Q2 and with FX neutralizing over the second half of our fiscal year, assuming no large variation from existing current foreign exchange rates. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to national security, space exploration and energy transition priorities mainly in the US, Europe and Australia as well as infrastructure monetization solutions such as US 5G telecom investments. Q1 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency, driven by the Idaho nuclear remediation project contract that ramped up in Q2 of last year. For the remainder of fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits for the CMS business as we now compare to quarters that include the Idaho project. CMS book to bill was just over 1 times and continues to be impacted by the approaching NASA Kennedy rebid, which we expect to be awarded soon. Gross profit margins were down year-over-year due to the revenue mix impact from the lower margin remediation project and the year ago closeout benefits associated with our strong performance on several enterprise contracts. CMS operating profit was $82 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was in line with expectations and was down 170 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, but up 60 basis points sequentially from the Q4 figure. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023 with the ability to expand margins as we can convert higher margin opportunities in our sales pipeline. Moving to Divergent Solutions. Gross revenue was up 11% year-over-year. And when excluding the impact from pass-throughs, net revenue increased 7% year-over-year. We expect net revenue growth to accelerate materially in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings. Gross margins in Divergent are in line with our consolidated gross margin, which we believe provides us the ability to significantly expand DVS operating margins as we gain additional scale from our heightened growth investments. Operating profit margins were 6%, driven by early stage investments and well below our future run rate projections for this business as we begin to embed integrated [data] enabled offerings in our core markets. We expect Divergent to finish fiscal 2023 with margins approaching double digits. Turning to PA Consulting. The translation impact from a stronger US dollar from the year ago period continued to impact reported revenue and operating profit growth. Revenue from PA was down 3% year-over-year in US dollars but up over 11% in British pounds. PA had a solid book-to-bill of over 1 times. We expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during fiscal year 2023. Turning to profitability. During fiscal year 2022, PA aggressively hired ahead of an increasing demand from strong secular growth opportunities across energy transition, sustainable consumer goods and strategic and digital transformation opportunities. While the sales pipeline remains robust and backlog continues to grow, the delayed conversion of these opportunities into burn continues to impact utilization. As a result, Q1 operating profit margins were 18%. While actions have been taken to significantly improve utilization, we expect margins to improve incrementally approaching 20% as we exit the fiscal year. Our nonallocated corporate costs were $40 million, down year-over-year as we made a strategic decision to move to a more flexible paid time off program in the US and invest further enhanced employee welfare plans, including improved medical, 401(k) match benefits and parental leave offerings. We believe this strategic decision is key to further strengthening our culture and attracting and retaining world class talent. While Q1 was lower than our previous quarter run rate guidance, we do expect that our corporate costs for the year will increase to our previous estimate of $190 million to $210 million. And we are monitoring our medical and other fringe costs closely which can vary depending upon our revenue and delivery mix as well as seasonality of medical claims. Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $270 million and included an outflow of $60 million for payment of the CARES Act deferral benefit of payroll taxes and $6 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding the unusual payment associated with the CARES Act, our underlying free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $330 million. In the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to approximate the year ago figure driven by the very strong Q1 performance. For the full year, we continue to anticipate 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we repurchased approximately $140 million of share during the quarter. As we previously have discussed -- as we previously announced, the Board of Directors has also approved a new three year $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares if we see price dislocation in our relative valuation. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulting in $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q1 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. And given our commitment to inclusion and diversity, all of Jacobs bank debt now has a sustainability linked KPR target of achieving a 40% female representation in our management team as defined as our Vice President and above population. As of the end of Q1, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, which includes our $500 million notional interest rate lock of 2.7%. As of the first quarter, our weighted average interest cost was 4.6%. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on March 24th. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob. So look, I think the M&A pipeline, we have a list of opportunities at every single point in time. There are things that are of interest. But ultimately, I would suggest to you that we really have nothing to comment on other than we do believe there's some things that are aligned with our strategy. And remember, how we think about our deployment of capital against M&A is to be aligned with our accelerators. So it's climate response, that's data consulting, data solutions and data -- consulting and advisory. So those are the areas we're continuing to focus on. And certainly, given the strong cash flow that we continue to generate, we'll have degrees of freedom to deploy that capital as appropriate when we see value added opportunities. The focus 2023 to the extent that there is any indications that are really related to the real estate impairment. It's part of our overall Focus 2023 initiative. So it's not over and above the kind of real estate impairments that I highlighted. Yes. So look, I think we are a proactive team that always evaluates what we believe is the right portfolio for our company, both now and into the future. We've proven that by the divestiture that we executed against in 2019 with the sale of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business, which one could argue was actually the legacy of the company. So we are always proactive in that consideration. So I'll leave it there. And so we can't really comment on anything other than, look, we always consider the opportunities. As it relates to CMS, we do believe that they are going to be able to get up into the 8% margins over the course of the year. So we see improving, they're at a point in time where some of the wins that they've had, which are a little bit higher margin are yet to kind of get into the burn. And we would expect that, that will be happening over the course of the balance of the year. And just to clarify as well, when we talk about the future, I think we're approaching 8% for the year, which means because we started at the level we are, we're going to have to be having in subsequent quarters margins that are going to be above 8%. Look, I think the bottom line is we have an Omnibus in place for 2023. So what we're really fundamentally talking about is a continuing resolution for 2024. Look, it remains to be seen how that plays out. Clearly, there's some differences of opinion in the house right now relative to where we may end up. I would say the good news is relative to this, if there is good news, is that we're kind of based off a strong Omnibus program in 2023, it could impact new items getting funded, but we're based on a 23% kind of level, which is pretty straightforward. As it relates to the disruption relative to the debt and whatnot, we think our view is they'll come to some rational conclusion on that, but we'll see how that plays out. Well, there's a couple of things that we have to recognize certainly exchange rates are a positive, but also we have incremental interest costs that are largely offsetting that. So there's gives and takes here. I think given the dynamic of how we're playing out in DC, I think we're being prudent relative to our guidance that we've provided. And look, there's gives and takes here. FX isn't the only one. I would say, certainly, interest is some headwinds that we're facing and then the business is kind of net off. And I think at the end of the day, we're I think, positioned for good results for the full year fiscal 2023. That would certainly be consistent with our strategy. I would say the margin burn that I was referring to is second half oriented primarily. So as we look to beyond 2023, certainly consistent with our strategy, we are always looking for an incremental profit improvement in terms of margin. So yes, that would be consistent with our execution strategy."

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Starting on Slide 4. I'd like to welcome to the call, Claudia Jaramillo, who is currently our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. We recently announced her transition to CFO later this year. I'm excited to now lead Jacobs as CEO. Over the last several years, we have repositioned the company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio and capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent sectors. At this juncture in our strategy, strong execution and focus is pivotal to our success. There are three key priorities, first, we will maintain our inclusive and inspirational culture that fosters the creativity needed to live by our mission, challenges today reinventing tomorrow. Second, we will focus on driving a higher structural growth rate across our core sectors by executing against the three needle moving growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory across the entire organization and sectors we serve. While we are in a leading position to capitalize on the mega trends and structural tailwinds, our relentless focus on long term client relationships is driving sustained growth. Third, we will deliver long term returns for our shareholders by driving further operational discipline across the business to accelerate cash flow generation with disciplined capital allocation. From a financial standpoint, our underlying business remains strong. Our People & Places Solutions line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 8% year-over-year, 13% in constant currency, operating profit up 20% year-over-year, 28% in constant currency, and we continue to gain market share in both the global critical infrastructure and advanced facility sectors. In CMS, we continue to deliver a strong base of recurring revenue with a growing new business pipeline. We anticipate strong tailwinds and backlog growth with CMS moving forward. PA Consulting experienced lower than expected utilization, but we continue to experience double digit top line and backlog growth. We are seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in PA sales pipeline. The number of recent wins underscores our strategy and demonstrates our move of the value chain with our clients to higher margin consulting and advisory services. Across the company, we see exciting opportunities ahead of us, specifically in the areas of climate response and especially in energy transition. Our ability to deliver data enabled solutions is enhancing our clients' resilience and sustainability. The establishment of Divergent Solutions enables Jacobs to scale and deploy our domain centric data platforms across multiple sectors and geographies, further enabling us to deliver solutions to typically complex challenges. I will talk to these key themes further in the presentation. Turning to Slide 5. We remain steadfastly committed to our cultural transformation to create an inspirational journey for all. In 2015, we started our culture journey with the empowerment and accountability, incorporating inclusion, innovation and inspiration into the very fabric of the company. I believe our emphasis on inclusion and diversity has been a critically important contributor to our success and provides a key differentiator in attracting and retaining the world's best talent as well as driving innovation for our clients. A key benefit of being a company with a broad range of capabilities is our ability to provide multiple career and development opportunities, what we refer to as agile careers. When we learn and grow together, we activate empowerment and accountability, inclusion and diversity and innovation. We lead, embrace and anticipate change. To further demonstrate our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we have included a KPI in the refinancing of our credit facilities linked to female leadership representation. Kevin will discuss further details in his remarks. Turning to Slide 6. Our commitment to sustainability is core to our strategy and our significant performance is being recognized by many of the top ESG accredited institutions. Over the past five years, we have advanced to an industry leading status. This culminated in our inclusion into 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, ranking Jacobs among the world's leading companies with outstanding sustainability performance. While the scores themselves are impressive, what's even more significant is the public recognition of Jacobs' positive impact on our clients, communities and the world. As we turn to Slide 7, we will focus on our 4 key growth sectors of critical infrastructure, energy and environment, advanced facilities and national security. These growth sectors are are driven by the following catalysts: federal government stimulus from the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, supply chain and technology investments in advanced facilities and the emergence of increased global threats. Let's examine the legislative drivers first and our positioning in the market. I am proud that Jacobs has helped our clients secure over $1 billion in IIJA competitive grants since its patent, and the bill is only in its early stages. We supported our clients in securing over $350 million in IIJA competitive grant funding just last quarter, the largest quarter since the passing of the act. This includes the largest grant awarded nationwide for subway station accessibility in New York City, a major port infrastructure development grant to a long term client in Alaska, the first phase award of one of the largest water treatment plants in the US and the design of a sustainable battery recycling facility. With another four years of locked in and robust funding the US infrastructure climate is strong. The coming months will also bring the first dollars of two other areas of focus for Jacobs. The inflation Reduction Act with $369 billion to fund the Green Economy transition and the CHIPS Act for semiconductor investment, all in core Jacob sectors. Before the end of the calendar year, we fully expect to have all three bills firing at full strength and funding critical projects sponsored by local governments, the federal government and the semiconductor industry. This overlap of spending will continue for four or five consecutive fiscal quarters and drive growth across the infrastructure and energy markets. In advanced facilities, we continue to see sustained capital investment in the semiconductor manufacturing space, biotechnology capacity expansions and the electric vehicle ecosystem, all being driven by reshaping of global supply chains, technology advancements and decarbonization efforts. Turning to Slide 8. As evidenced by double digit pipeline growth in each of these sectors, our industry position continues to grow, and we see this being a long term secular trend. In addition to previously discussed infrastructure wins, we have been awarded major programs in the semiconductor space to include greenfield expansions in the US and Europe for a global chip manufacturer. In the biotechnology sector, we have won multiple expansions in the US, Europe and Asia, and we continue to see global growth in electric vehicle ecosystem driven by a favorable regulatory environment with project wins for battery and vehicle manufacturing and charging infrastructure in the US and Europe. Within National Security, we are seeing increased defense spending in the US, UK and Australia due to continued global threat. As highlighted as a future prospect last quarter, in the US, we were successful in winning a critical Cyber Intelligence Award for $469 million, five year contract for a classified defense customer to provide secure data and network solutions globally. In the UK, PA is leading the consortium that has been selected by the MoD to deliver Crenic, a future force protection electronic countermeasures program. It will provide the next generation of innovative solutions to counter the threat posed by radio controlled and provides explosive devices, otherwise known as IEDs. And in Australia, we are supporting the acquisition and sustainment of military platforms for the Australian Defense Department, which has engaged Jacobs with increasing volumes of work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12. Our portfolio is positioned to benefit from multiple secular growth trends across our core sectors with the opportunity to structurally increase our long term earnings power by executing against our growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. We reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.20 to $7.50, which incorporates recent FX rates. In closing, I would like to reiterate my priorities as CEO to maintain an inspirational and inclusive culture that will capitalize on our growth accelerators and drive long term returns for our shareholders. Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere condolences on behalf of Jacobs to all those affected by the terrible earthquakes that occurred in Turkey and Syria earlier this week. Our employees have yet again demonstrated a culture of caring and practice by raising their hands to seek ways to support those most impacted by this tragedy. I'm proud to lead a company that rises to the calling in such challenging circumstances. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Go ahead, Kevin. From a resources standpoint, Michael, I'd say that we're feeling comfortable. And really, it goes back to what we've talked about previously. Our use of global talent has really balanced our ability to deliver on our clients' expectations. So it's not where the capital is being deployed. It doesn't necessarily map to where we source talent and deliver the solutions that were expected and can deliver. So we're really positive about the resources front. As far as of the areas that we're looking at, I'd say that specifically in infrastructure and even more specifically in energy transition is providing some real overextended growth opportunities. And that was very evident this quarter in our growth in pipeline, I talked about double digit composite for the entirety of our insectors, the highest was energy transition. And we've got a great base, great talent, great solutions and with work that we've already been doing in the renewable space for quite a while, it's serving us well. So let me answer the last part first. I think that the infrastructure ramp up is pretty locked in with regards to IIJ. And then the effects that the IRA and the CHIPS Act will be supplemental to that. My comment about the end of the year is that those three will be in real time. So we're feeling comfortable about that four year time line. I think what's also important to understand is that when we -- the difference between the appropriation, the deployment of the funds and capital and then the duration of the projects, programs and engagements, that has a tail on it that's six to seven years. And so you see -- Kevin talked about the backlog growth in revenue being kind of in that mid single digits, but the gross margin being in double digits on a constant currency basis, that's really a function of where we are in the phasing of that work. So comfortable on that front. As far as could that mean incremental growth to what we've already projected in our out year plan, we're feeling strongly that it could really be a big part of the company. So we're optimistic. If I could add just one item to what Kevin said. When we talk about energy transition, please keep in mind that, that includes components of CMS that's around our our nuclear new build and the AMR SMR technologies that we have, and we're seeing some real opportunities and growth in Europe that will be contributing to the margin profile that Kevin mentioned. Go ahead, and then I'll back you up. And right now, the programs, Michael, that we're looking at are not totally insulated, but we've got a strong view on those programs being funded here in the near term -- awarded. And then, Robert, maybe I'll make a couple of comments on the markets. The reason why we highlighted those four sectors that we did is the tailwinds that we are seeing and it's materializing in the double digit pipeline growth, the backlog growth that we're seeing and our bookings performance, all leading indicators to strengthen those markets. The burn of those bookings is something we continue to monitor very closely. But the stage that we're coming in on those programs are creating a higher level of utilization, specifically in the US for the Jacobs business. Louie, I think if you go back over a decade ago, that lumpiness was -- in the time between cycles, whether it be semi or in life sciences was a lot longer. We're seeing those cycles contract look at the current semi cycle as well. And so we think that, that long term growth aspect versus what we used to see a decade ago, we've demonstrated that the diversity of our portfolio has been able to really sustain that. You mentioned '22, it was also '21 as well. So we're feeling really positive there. The other item I would highlight is that it's the reason what's driving these growth catalysts, the reason why we highlighted the supply chain disruption as well as technology advancements is that in the past, the lumpiness was driven by demand. And so capacity was almost exclusively tied to demand and then you could just map it via economic cycles. Today, that has completely changed and the drivers are more driven around technology advancements, reshaping of supply chains from the east to the west as well as innovations that are happening in, whether it be chip design or novel therapy. So the drivers also give us that level of confidence too. Maybe I'll talk first on the recompetes. Outside of Kennedy, for the next 12 to 18 months, I think that was the time line that you put it at nothing of that size. We have smaller recompetes that are probably a little less under the radar -- a little bit more under the radar. But those are well within the normal cycle of our business. On the CR with new programs, Gautam, that's one where we continue to be very sensitive to that. From a recompete standpoint, those could end up being upside for us, because we're on programs that are continuing to be determined. But I think the diversity of our portfolio has lessened the impact of what we saw historically with CRs. And so I think that's where -- I think it would not be wise of us to predict the effect of CRs. But I think the diversity is where we see the hedge and we feel confident about our business. Our confidence is solid. As whether it be NASA or other clients you could even outside the aerospace world, we've grown with our clients. So the intimacy that we have with the science of our clients' business has allowed us to be their long term advocate and long term partner. So wherever the space industry goes, a movement to commercial, which we're involved with or in other areas of exploration, we've been a part of that journey and a valued partner. So we're feeling confident. I'd say it's broad based. This is -- again, when we keep reiterating, moving up the value chain with our clients, these are higher higher level technically complex as well as digitally enabled offerings that we have now in the marketplace, which is driving that higher margin in our backlog. And so it's not acutely focused in a specific one area, it's across the board. All right. Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. Looking forward to future calls and providing further updates on upcoming events and on our further calls. So thank you very much, and have a great week."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Jacobs Solutions Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Bert Subin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Bert, you may begin.\nBert Subin: Thank you, Krista, and good morning, everyone. Our earnings announcement was filed earlier this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during this call. Please note, our 10-K will be filed by no later than our due date of November 26. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacob's Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Venk will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance, including commentary on end market trends, cash flows, balance sheet data and our FY '25 outlook. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Bert, and I'm delighted to welcome you to Jacobs at such an exciting time. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 business performance. Now moving to Slide 4. We reached a critical milestone on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value and higher margin portfolio during the quarter as we closed the separation transaction involving our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses, on September 27, 2024, culminating with Amentum successfully listing on the NYSE under the ticker, AMTM. This strategic shift has been well received by the market, highlighting confidence in our focused direction and reinforcing our commitment to delivering sustained value and growth for our shareholders. Upon closing the transaction, we received $911 million, which was concurrently used to repay existing debt. Additionally, as a part of the transaction, we received a 7.5% equity ownership in Amentum, which could rise to 8%. At the same time, Jacob\u2019s shareholders became 51% owners in shares of Amentum and their ownership stake could increase up to 55%. I want to take a moment to emphasize how important this transaction is for Jacobs. As a more sharply focused company operating in robust end markets with strong secular growth tailwinds, we believe Jacobs is in an excellent position to create substantial shareholder value. Our simplified structure, global delivery model and ongoing operating efficiencies, positions us nicely to build on a strong end to FY '24. This is a testament to the dedication and relentless efforts of our employees, whose hard work is paving the way forward for two exceptional companies. I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations to each of them for their role in this pivotal transformation. Turning to Slide 5. We provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, with CMS and C&I under discontinued operations. So please note, the results we highlight are related only to continuing operations. Focusing in on the quarter. Total gross revenue increased 4% in Q4, with adjusted net revenue rising 4%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, and includes a positive $1.20 impact from the mark-to-market of our investment in Amentum, netted against the amortization of intangibles, as well as a $0.19 impact from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.37, marking a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 came in at $289 million, which represented a 12% growth versus FY '23. Overall, we are pleased to close out the year with such a positive performance. Looking at the full year. Total gross revenue increased 6% with adjusted net revenue rising 5%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $4.79 and included a positive $0.50 impact, related primarily to the net effect of amortization of acquired intangibles and the mark-to-market of our investment in Amentum, and a negative impact of $1.07 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again, were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $5.28, marking a 16% increase compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for FY '24 was $1.06 billion, representing a 9% increase versus FY '23. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.35 times as our consolidated backlog increased 23% year-on-year in Q4. Fewer metrics will be watched closely and we are encouraged by the trajectory we're delivering on, with an extremely strong 1.67 times book-to-bill for the fourth quarter. When we analyze our backlog, we are seeing this trend across gross revenue and backlog as well as gross profit and backlog, which is a good indicator as we think about our growth for FY '25 and beyond. Turning to Slide 6, and building on my backlog and book-to-bill commentary. I'm excited to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins across the business and across geographies, a testament to our market positioning, deep domain expertise, and long-term trusted client relationships. As we move forward as a simpler and more focused company, we will be providing commentary on revenue across three key end markets, water and environmental, life sciences and advanced manufacturing and critical infrastructure. These end markets roll up to infrastructure and advanced facilities, which is comprised of our historic P&PS business and the retained portion of Divergent Solutions. PA Consulting remains in its own segment and is unchanged. On Slide 14, in the appendix, we provide a graphic that depicts our new structure and end-market focus. Moving on to how our end markets are performing. Water and Environmental is demonstrating impressive growth. Water conveyance, water infrastructure, wastewater, potable reuse and efficient asset management are just some of the key drivers of our client spend. And we have been successful servicing demand across these categories with double-digit growth in Q4. Notably, during Q4, we delivered several key wins, including our appointment by the Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment to provide progressive design build services for the Donald C. Tillman Advanced Water Equalization basins, a critical part of LA's long-term plans to increase recycled water production by 2035. Significantly, this is one of the single largest bookings in the Water and Environmental end market in our company's history. In Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, we continue to see robust demand from Life Sciences clients, boosted by GLP-1 investment, and we expect this trend to continue in FY '25. In Semiconductors, we are diversifying our customer base and expanding our global reach. One example is our recent design win for a new test and assembly facility with CG Semi in India. The facility will manufacture advanced and legacy packages for industries such as automotive, consumer, industrial and 5G communications, and facilitate our strategic positioning in India where electronics manufacturing spend is expected to grow meaningfully. Global investment spending across Life Sciences, Semis and Data Centers is creating a robust backdrop for Jacobs in FY '25 and beyond. Moving on to Critical Infrastructure. During the quarter, we secured a technical project manager role with the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero in the UK. A great example of how we are leveraging our differentiated offering in energy security and transition that demonstrates the power of our partnership and greater collaboration with PA Consulting. We will provide project management and advisory services along with associated strategic support to the Hydrogen and Industrial Carbon Capture program that includes consulting, end-to-end innovation, design and analytics. We are also seeing continued traction in the Middle East as Saudi Vision 2030 significantly increases the number of opportunities across critical infrastructure. Notably, during Q4, we announced a new award to lead advisory, design and engineering for the King Salman International Airport, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Our outlook for near and long-term expansion in the region remains intact and we are seeing signals of strong demand for infrastructure projects across the globe in the early days of FY '25. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to grow the business and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations. We're excited for the future as a more focused company and look forward to presenting our strategic vision for growth over the coming years at our Investor Day, in Miami, on February 18. Now, I'll turn the call over to Venk to review our financial results in further detail.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you, Bob, and good day, everyone. We are pleased with our Q4 performance, which contributed to a strong year. Let me now begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slides 7 and 8. Starting on Slide 7, we show quarterly results, and I'll provide additional context and detail around our performance from continuing operations. As Bob noted, CMS and C&I have been excluded from our results as those businesses are listed under discontinued operations. We provide a reconciliation on Page 24 in the appendix, that will allow you to compare results for the enterprise, including the businesses that were separated in the fourth quarter. Notably, I want to highlight, that in total, we did outpace the $7.95 adjusted EPS midpoint for fiscal '24 that we guided to with Q3 results. However, from here forth, we will only be discussing continuing operations. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 4% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes the impact of pass-through revenue, also grew 4%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $289 million, growing 12% year-over-year to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.6%, which is an increase of approximately 100 basis points from last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.37, marking a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Please note that during the quarter, GAAP EPS benefited from a $187 million pre-tax gain associated with the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Amentum with no benefit to adjusted EPS. Additionally, PA Consulting contributed $0.10 of EPS dilution to GAAP EPS from periodic fair value change impacts on our redeemable non-controlling interest balances, and this impact was added back to adjusted EPS in Q4. We provide a walk-through of our adjusted EPS calculation for continuing operations on Slide 23. Finally, consolidated backlog was up almost 23% year-over-year to $21.8 billion. The trailing 12-month revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.35 times, with our gross profit and backlog increasing 12% year-over-year. As Bob noted earlier, this is an encouraging data point as we look ahead to fiscal '25. The Q4 book-to-bill of 1.67 times, though partly a function of higher pass-through revenue, is still very positive and helped us end the year on a high note. Moving on to Slide 8, I'll recap fiscal '24 results. Fiscal '24 total gross revenue increased 6% year-over-year, with adjusted net revenue rising 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% as a function of higher revenue and just over 40 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 16% year-on-year. We're pleased to end fiscal '24 in a strong position with solid organic revenue growth, double-digit EPS growth and a backlog that sets us up for continued growth in fiscal '25 and beyond. Regarding the performance of our end markets in the quarter, let's now turn to Slide 9. As Bob noted earlier, we're reporting our business as Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, and PA Consulting, and we will discuss revenue trends in our three key end markets. This should provide helpful context to supplement our overall results. We'll focus on adjusted net revenue in our discussion as we believe this is a better indicator of business trends as it excludes pass-through revenues. However, we do list gross revenue growth across each end market for your reference. In Water and Environmental, growth was solid, with adjusted net revenue increasing 13% versus the same quarter last year. Water and Environmental demand has been strong and we expect that to continue in fiscal '25 based on our current backlog and pipeline. Encouragingly, demand is being driven by multiple geographies, with North America, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, all growing double digits in the quarter. Our Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing end market revenue grew 3% in Q4, with strength partially offset by an unfavorable revenue adjustment related to an EV battery manufacturer customer bankruptcy in Europe. Our outlook for this end market is for Life Sciences to be the primary driver of revenue growth in fiscal '25 as capital investment from our Life Sciences customers remains robust. We're also seeing our customer base broaden in Semis and the AI data center opportunity is expanding. As we look into fiscal '25 and beyond, we anticipate top-line growth in this end market, not only from rising industry investment, but also differentiation through our cross-cutting Water and Energy capabilities. In Critical Infrastructure, adjusted net revenue increased 1%, with North America showing steady growth, while certain international markets have lagged. We expect to see improvement across critical infrastructure in fiscal '25, with our backlog and pipeline underpinning a strong recovery as transportation project demand is rising. Putting this all together, we have line of sight to maintaining strong revenue growth in Water and Environmental and increasing our growth rates in Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, as well as Critical Infrastructure end markets in the coming year relative to Q4. Now moving on to Slide 10, I will provide a quick overview of our segment financials. We saw strong trends in Q4 for Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities operating profit, which increased 12% year-over-year in total and 12% on a constant currency basis. In fiscal '24, operating profit increased 9% year-over-year and 9% on a constant currency basis. Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities results were aided by both revenue growth and margin expansion. Moving on to PA Consulting, results reflect modest top-line growth, but good execution on the bottom-line. Q4 operating profit increased 4% year-over-year and fiscal '24 operating profit increased 1%. Both were slightly negative on a constant currency basis. However, we are encouraged by recent bookings and anticipate that growth will trend higher in fiscal '25. Moving on to Slide 11, we provide an overview of cash generation and balance sheet data. For fiscal '24, free cash flow from continuing operations was strong at $718 million and enabled us to repurchase $403 million in shares and pay $143 million in cash dividends. We also paid down debt and ended the year with roughly $1.1 billion in net debt, which represented a net leverage ratio of 1.0 times on LTM adjusted EBITDA. This is at the low end of our 1.0 times to 1.5 times target. Our balance sheet strength will enable continued investment in the business as well as returns to shareholders through share repurchases and long-term dividend growth. We currently have $472 million in remaining authorization under our repurchase program, and recently declared a dividend of $0.29, a 12% increase year-over-year. And finally, please turn to Slide 12 for our fiscal '25 outlook. We expect adjusted net revenue to increase mid to high-single digits year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8% to 14%, adjusted EPS to range from $5.80 to $6.20, and reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%. We will have cash outflows related to restructuring of $75 million to $95 million in fiscal 2025, with that impact declining through fiscal '25. The midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS would indicate about 14% growth year-over-year, and the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA would indicate approximately 15% growth year-over-year, highlighting our strong outlook for business performance this year. We provide relevant assumptions on the right side of the page to help you with your modeling. One item to be mindful of is our projected tax rate of approximately 26%. Our fiscal '25 tax rate is expected to be several points higher than in fiscal '24 and fiscal '23, and is a function of multiple discrete tax benefits in those historical periods that are not expected to recur. Despite the higher tax rate, we will still anticipate strong adjusted EPS growth in fiscal '25. I'd note, from a trend perspective, we expect to start fiscal '25 with Q1 revenue adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings below Q4 of fiscal '24, reflecting typical seasonality. However, as we progress through fiscal '25, we expect to see sequential growth in our financial results through Q4. Overall, we're excited about the future of Jacobs and are entering fiscal '25 in a strong position financially, with positive underlying momentum in the business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Venk. In closing, as a more focused Enterprise, we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum, in the Water and Environmental, Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, and Critical Infrastructure end markets. And we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across our business, over time. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on a very active and successful spin and the recap.\nBob Pragada: Thanks, Mike.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: So impressive, you standalone backlog growth, and heading into 2025. Maybe you can talk about the pipeline you see maybe amongst the three major end markets, growth in pipeline year-over-year, and how much of your 2025 net revenues and EBITDA do you currently have kind of in backlog or in sight, and what's required to achieve your midpoint year targets?\nBob Pragada: Sure. So Michael, on the first question, pipeline growth has been really, really strong. If you look at the kind of the big verticals, Water and Environmental up double-digits on a pipeline basis. Advanced Facilities really driven by Life Sciences, we're seeing double-digit growth in that pipeline. And in Critical Infrastructure, which is really driven by transportation. We're seeing a nice comeback on the pipeline, specifically in our European to include the UK and Australia and New Zealand end markets. Middle East continues to grow too. So if you kind of aggregate those, the pipeline looks really, really strong. On the second, don't want to, go too far on the actual number, but I'd say, historically, we would see a certain percentage of -- our next fiscal year revenue in backlog. That percentage is a higher percentage this year. Now, on a 1.67 times book-to-bill, that's not all in one year, that's multiyear booking, but the kind of contracted component for FY '25 is a very strong number.\nMichael Dudas: That's helpful. My follow-up is, Bob, maybe you can share views from your client base and how Jacobs positioning relative to the election and some of the machinations we're hearing out of the federal government, how that could translate to your FAGUS (ph) business in the U.S.?\nBob Pragada: Sure. So, maybe two parts to that question. We kind of see it overall as a net neutral. If we -- if you look at those end markets that were -- now as the new Jacobs honed in on, these are jobs that were either tied to some level of state and local element, which are continuing, kind of think Water and Environmental. And the transportation jobs that we're in the middle of, at a national level in the U.S., have got long tails on them, and we still see the pipeline really strong. So infrastructure wise, we're feeling it's a net neutral. Just as a note, lately been seeing some softness within the federal market. In now our portfolio, about 10% of our business is in that federal market. However, it's -- of that 10%, a majority of that is in DoD and DoD infrastructure, specifically, which we see that pipeline continuing on. Advanced Facilities, continued strong. That industrial reshoring, onshoring, as well as, what's happening in the world of science and technology, specifically in the U.S., we're feeling confident about it.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning, and I'll add my congratulations on the completion of the deals. And thanks for all the color on the growth rates within the segments. It's a pretty wide range of growth rates between Water versus the Life Sciences versus the Critical Infrastructure, 1,000 basis points or more, it seems like. And I know you said you expect the slower ones to accelerate. Can you just maybe frame for us, kind of how big a gap you're expecting or how much you can close that gap between them? And just, kind of curious, was there that big a gap or a drag from that EV cancellation in the quarter? And was there any sort of weather impact as one of your peers cited? Thanks.\nBob Pragada: Yeah. So let me answer the last part, Steve, first, and just kind of breaking down those three main areas. And your next question -- your first question. It was a gap, that EV cancellation. So on the AF or the Advanced Facilities component, we do see closing that gap. It would have been closed already, but the future looks very bright there, and represented by our backlog. Water and Environmental, we see continued growth. And on transportation, specifically Critical Infrastructure, what we're seeing in our pipeline as well as Q1. So to be reporting wins in transportation specifically, outside the U.S., is really that gap was outside the U.S. That's already, we've already seen that in real time. Certainty in the budget in the UK is giving us confidence there as well as some really strong wins that we've had in Australia and New Zealand coming out. So we don't really see that gap being a big one.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. How should we think about the progress now on some of the corporate costs that you have embedded in the segment reporting in '25 versus '24? And relative to the restructuring costs, it sounds like, that will kind of continue on through the year. Do you think fourth quarter will still have some of that in there, or it will be done by the time fourth quarter starts? Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Go, Venk.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yeah. Thank you, Steve. So a couple of questions. So one on the, the overall cost structure. As you can tell, we made a pretty significant progress in fiscal '24 in terms of our operating margin and EBITDA margin expansion. And I would say there's still room there in terms of improving the margins over time, and that's why we guided to 100 basis point increase year-on-year for fiscal '25. And if you look at the various parts of it, clearly, from the standpoint of operational efficiency, we still have room there. We've had a -- we'll have a full year of what you call annualization of operating efficiencies, because lot of it happened, towards the second half of fiscal '24. You'll see a lot of that manifest in its entirety in fiscal '25. And then, overall, cost controls is something that we are focused on. And last but not least, we are continuing to improve our mix of our business as well as how we implement these projects from a global connectivity standpoint. So, multiple facets to this margin story over time. And then your second question about restructuring. So as you pointed out, we did have restructuring in fiscal '24. Clearly, as you know, we have a commitment to Amentum to continue to do our transition services, that will last maybe another two, three quarters. So, we should see a pretty dramatic decline in our restructuring, going from fiscal '24 to fiscal '25, and we've quantified it in the range of $75 million to $95 million. Obviously, we'll try to do our best to make sure that marks the end of our restructuring in a meaningful way. Yeah. And then, the other part of the restructuring is obviously having, some ownership of liability with the PA Consulting business as well.\nSteven Fisher: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I guess I wanted to build on an earlier question, again, and just kind of talk about the backlog as it relates to the outlook. I mean, your backlog is up 22.5% year-over-year, which is great. But your revenue guidance is up, mid to high-single digits. That seems like a really wide gap. And so I heard some of the comments about, some longer projects. But is there stuff in the backlog that's not moving? Is some of the backlog, these bigger chunkier bookings like you're doing for maybe Advanced Technology and Life Sciences, you're doing construction management scope, is that kind of -- does that flow through as lower margin? There's a lot going on there, but I think the discrepancy between the backlog growth and the revenue guidance is worth digging into a little bit deeper. So if you could comment on that, I think would be helpful. Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Sure. And thanks, Andy. So a couple of things. Yeah. It is the most significant book-to-bill that we've had, probably in the history of the company, and really, really proud of that. The Life Sciences and the Water bookings that we've had are large, and they're multiyear. And so, they're not any -- and they're not -- they're not degrading (ph) to margins. These are at and in certain cases above our kind of corporate margins that we've demonstrated here in the last few quarters. So it's the multi-year component of that, that is driving the revenue guidance. And we also gave, room on the mid to high-single digits to kind of compensate for the bell shaped curve on a project lifecycle too. So, like we -- we're feeling really good. These are some of the largest bookings that we've had, and I think I mentioned in the script, in the history of the company, which kind of goes through the testament of our market positioning right now.\nAndrew Wittmann: Got it. It's kind of a question I want to ask. Also, I mean, the restructuring, obviously, this was kind of expected, you've got the Amentum transition services and all the first year things that go with the spin off. But Bob, as you look at '26, do you feel like '26 is the year that we get pretty clean results? It sounds like even at the end of this year, it's pretty clean. So -- but I thought maybe I'd have you comment on '26 as -- kind of similar.\nBob Pragada: No, absolutely.\nAndrew Wittmann: I think it's an important question.\nBob Pragada: It's a very important question, and thanks for asking it. I'd say second half, you're going to see a significant decay. And '26, short answer, yes. Yes, being clean, yeah.\nAndrew Wittmann: Yeah. Got it. Thanks, guys. That's all I have for today.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSabahat Khan: Hey. Great. Thanks, and good morning. Just about to your earlier comment around some of the buffer that you've built into the 5%, or sorry, call it, the mid to high-single digit organic growth rate to allow for some of these longer life projects. This seems to be in line with the guidance you provided pre-election. I guess, would you say that range also builds in some buffer for maybe administration change or just kind of seeing how things evolve in early part of the year? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about the low end versus the high end given some of the moving pieces, particularly on the U.S. side? Thanks.\nBob Pragada: Yeah, Saba. My answer was really -- was based on our clients activity. And going back to, any type of potential delays that happened as a result of the election, those would -- we don't feel like those would pertain to these jobs that are going forward at the state and local level, supporting some pretty large events that are happening in Los Angeles and in other venues around the world, specifically on the Water and Transportation side. And then, on the Advanced Facility side, these are commitments that our clients have made to the end markets on some pretty, pretty critical therapies that the world needs. So these are tied to global trends that are probably a little segregated from what might happen with regards to churn in the Beltway. So those were two, separate.\nVenk Nathamuni: And Saba, if I could add, the range that we've provided, from our guidance perspective, we try to guide for what we think is the most likely outcome. And obviously, as Bob alluded to, it depends on the profile of the customer burn and so forth. And so that's what's imputed in our guidance. And that's why we provided the range to -- in the mid to high-single digits for revenue growth.\nSabahat Khan: All right. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the markets outside of the U.S., as we look at maybe the UK, the Middle East. It looks like some changing priority in the Middle East, but it sounds like from your commentary that's going well. Can you maybe just talk about kind of the -- kind of your focus on those regions? What drives you kind of to continue to be exposed there? It looks like there's a lot of dollars there, particularly in the Middle East, but a bit of an evolution in how they're going about their development for the next few years? And also if you can just comment on, post the recent election in the UK, how you see the spending priorities reflected in the recent infrastructure or sort of the recent budget, and how they align with what you're doing in that market? Just want to get a bit more perspective on those two larger regions for you outside of the U.S. Thanks.\nBob Pragada: Sure. So, let me kind of breakdown the question here. On the two geographies, is -- and actually -- look this -- this comment is going to apply to every single one of our geographies. We are in the locales that we're in to service those local clients. And so, just on that element, with regards to the UK and the Middle East, those are strong markets. And yes, there's -- there are economic ebbs and flows in those markets. But our client base, especially now with our kind of our focus portfolio, these are long-term kind of trends. So any kind of near-term oscillations, if you look at it on the long-term, they're solid. And in the UK, in the Middle East, we're seeing some nice tailwinds that they're coming back and might not be as strong as 10 years ago or before. But compared to recent times, we're seeing some of that come through. How do we gauge that? We gauge that through our pipeline, and we're seeing our pipeline grow. And so, those -- kind of on that. Water in the UK never slowed down. So really the upside that we're talking about is more honed in on transportation as well as some of our Advanced Facilities world. But the key is that us staying in those geographies is really more about our talent, and that talent ends up addressing both the local market, but also there's some really, really key talent that we have in UK, Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, that are being deployed around the world. So that talent piece is really, really key in how we think about our global model. On the elections, we -- again, we don't think that that is going to affect, what we're talking about as far as the strength in the end markets. And so, we stand behind the numbers we put out.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNatalia Bach: Hi. Good morning. This is Natalia Bach on behalf of Andy Kaplowitz.\nBob Pragada: Hi. Good morning.\nNatalia Bach: Good morning. First question I'd like to ask, in PA Consulting, exit margins reflect continued improvement. As we think about fiscal year '25, do you expect that trend to continue? And then can you provide more color on your visibility towards revenue growth expectations for the segment? You have relatively easier comps and backlog seems to be picking up. Any detail would be helpful.\nBob Pragada: Sure. Why don't I answer the first one and then Venk will address kind of the confidence in revenue growth coming in the year. As far as the margins go, we continue to see -- during -- even during, the run-up to the election in the UK as well as other areas that PA has a presence, the margins have stayed true and the team has done a really good job at continuing to focus in on higher value as well as strength of the offering that they have for their clients. So we don't -- we see that margin profile continuing, moving forward. Venk, you want to talk about the revenue growth?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yeah, absolutely. So in terms of just revenue growth for the PA Consulting business, we -- we've had good insight into their pipeline, especially over the last several quarters. And we're feeling pretty good about the inflection point in PA's business in terms of the growth really coming together in fiscal '25. Now, when we provided the high level guidance for our overall revenue growth of mid to high-single digits, that certainly imputes PA Consulting also, providing that growth acceleration from the prior year. So, all of that is taken into account as we give our overall guidance for all of, PA Consulting plus Jacobs, and we feel that there is certainly an inflection point in fiscal '25 with regards to the growth from PA Consulting.\nBob Pragada: And their PA -- then their -- and their backlog grew at the same rate as ours did.\nVenk Nathamuni: That's right. Yeah.\nNatalia Bach: Got it. Helpful. And then, just one more follow-up question for me. It appears the near-term -- focus with respect to capital deployment seems to be toward debt paydown and share repurchases. But as you now sit with your new portfolio, are there any areas in your portfolio where potential M&A could fill the gap?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yeah. No, great question. So first of all, and I'd like to reiterate that, as I mentioned in the script, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders in form of buybacks and dividends, and we return almost 60% of free cash flow in fiscal '24. So, we're continuing to commit to a significant portion of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders. On top of it, as you pointed out, we have been paying down debt. We did get about $911 million in Amentum proceeds on day one of the transaction, which we then used to pay down debt. And we do still have a 7.5% to 8% retained stake that we hope to monetize in the first half of calendar '25. And then beyond that, as I look at the capital allocation priorities for us, we -- there's a lot of excitement about organic growth opportunities in the business, so number one priority will continue to be investing in the organic growth of the business. Number two, as I said before, is returning, cash to shareholders in form of both dividends and buybacks, and we're committed to that. And then, finally, from an M&A perspective, certainly, that is an accelerant for us in the long term. We'll talk a lot more about it during Investor Day, but suffice it to say that we have lots of optionality with the balance sheet position that we have, the significant free cash flow that we generate, and our ability to return that to shareholders as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSangita Jain: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So if I could just take the growth outlook to a higher level, can you help us understand if you're thinking higher growth, internationally versus domestic, given the elections? I know we've discussed elections a few times already on this call.\nBob Pragada: No, Sangita. That's the way it came across if that wasn't the case. We had some flattening growth outside the U.S. in our infrastructure end markets. We're talking about that inflecting forward. Within the U.S., those numbers have been positive -- for the last fiscal year.\nSangita Jain: And how about your outlook for the upcoming year? Do you think the U.S. will still grow faster or how do you see it?\nBob Pragada: We do. And we're seeing that in our pipeline right now growing as well as our book-to-bill and the double-digit growth that we've had in backlog.\nSangita Jain: Okay. Then if I can follow-up on your talent pool, let's just say, we don't really know the policy priorities of the new administration yet, etc., but let's just say public spending in the U.S. does slow down, how fungible is your talent pool should you have to reallocate resources?\nBob Pragada: Yeah. I don't know if I would use the word fungible, but they're very deployable, and work on -- work all over the world, both in the U.S., outside the U.S., and from outside the U.S., in. It's really important to understand, the mix of our people in the U.S. and outside the U.S. does not map to our U.S. versus non-U.S. revenue stream. And so that is a very balanced look on how we utilize our people around the world.\nSangita Jain: Got it. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next\u2026\nBob Pragada: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nChad Dillard: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nBob Pragada: Yeah. Good morning, Chad.\nChad Dillard: So my question is on the algorithm for adjusted operating margins for the Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities business. So, I guess, like maybe if you could break it out in two ways. So first of all, I'm just trying to figure out, the three sub segments, like your -- it sounds like the Water business is growing faster, Life Sciences business is growing faster. To what extent is that accretive to margins? And then I guess, on the second part, you guys talked about, cost savings, like how do we think about like the year-on-year boost in margins from that?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yeah, Chad, thanks for those questions. So, I'd say the, look, first on the end markets, the way we model our business is to obviously go after the best opportunities that we have across those different end markets and continue to focus on top-line growth, but also in this way that optimizes margin so that it meets our corporate average, right? So, in any given quarter, any given in the first half or second half of the year, we can certainly have ups and downs with regards to the margin profiles. But what we try to optimize for is the good balance between, continued revenue growth as well as -- gross margins and operating margins improving over time. And that's what we've quantified in terms of our expectation for fiscal '25. So, I wouldn't say one business is any different from another from the standpoint of the optimization. But certainly, we want to continue to focus on profitable revenue growth such that both our revenue as well as the margins expand over time. So that's more work. And then going to your second question about cost savings, as I alluded to in response to a previous question, we have made significant strides in terms of improving the operating efficiency, but you had just six months of that take effect in fiscal '24. So we'll have the annualization of operating efficiencies take full effect in fiscal '25, and that's part of the margin expansion story for us. But it's not just that. I mean, in addition to it, as I mentioned before, we are optimizing our go-to-market, we're optimizing, our global connectivity, and so forth. So we do see a multi-year trend in terms of, focusing on improving our profitability over time, not just on the cost side, but certainly from a business mix standpoint as well as from an efficiency standpoint.\nChad Dillard: Great. That's helpful. And then the second question has to do with your revenue guidance for the full year, that mid to high-single digits. So, I guess to get to that higher end of that range, like what needs to go right, either from like a geographic standpoint or from, like, in market standpoint, like, what would you need to see there?\nBob Pragada: It would be if the -- if we see an acceleration in the jobs we're on. That heavy, heavy focus now from the backlog growth coming from our Water as well as Life Sciences sector is, those could be accelerated and we could find ourselves, on the higher end of that range. So, we're watching that very closely.\nChad Dillard: Great. Thanks all.\nBob Pragada: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Hi, yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Can I ask for the legacy People and Places business? You folks have delivered steady margin expansion, you're now running scope margins in the low-teens. As you think about the margin upside that you discussed over the course of this call, what do you think is a reasonable target or a bogey where you can drive that business over time? Are we talking about tens of basis points improvements? Or are the initiatives that you spoke about earlier, can we see a more significant margin upside in that line of business?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yeah, Jerry. Thank you for the question. And yes, certainly, we feel good about the margin expansion for fiscal '25 that I alluded to both in the prepared remarks as well as in response to a couple of questions. And as we look-ahead beyond fiscal '25, certainly, we'll provide you a lot more clarity when it comes to Investor Day, not just in terms of our revenue growth and, end market mix as well, but also in terms of capital allocation and margin expansion story. So, suffice it to say that we do feel good about our margin expansion in fiscal '25, and beyond that, we'll cover in more detail.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And let me ask you, I know it's early -- very early post Amentum, but obviously, the business leaders have been focused on the new Jacobs for, quite some time now, over a year. Can you just talk about, at the operating level, what kind of difference in performance that you're seeing or any developments that are notable as a result of the change in focus or the more narrowed change in focus, so far?\nBob Pragada: Yeah. Jerry, it's a great question. I'd say that the operating model is in full effect right now. You're right, we got out ahead of that during the course of the year. I think the biggest change has been getting back to where we came from where we were externally focused on our clients' business. And that has really come to the core of how we think about the world. And instead of being internally focused on, some of the transactions that we were doing, whether they'd be over the course of the last couple of years or leading up to this quarter. So that's been the real change, understanding our clients' business and we're seeing it in our sales performance in Q3 and Q4 of last year. So, we're excited because those actions and those behaviors are turning into a 22% backlog growth at a 1.67 times book-to-bill. And that's kind of -- the proof is in the numbers. So, we're excited.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Thank you.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you.\nOperator: And I will now turn the conference back over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks.\nBob Pragada: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Look forward to providing further updates and visiting with investors and analysts in the coming weeks and months. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Bert, and I'm delighted to welcome you to Jacobs at such an exciting time. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 business performance. Now moving to Slide 4. We reached a critical milestone on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value and higher margin portfolio during the quarter as we closed the separation transaction involving our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses, on September 27, 2024, culminating with Amentum successfully listing on the NYSE under the ticker, AMTM. This strategic shift has been well received by the market, highlighting confidence in our focused direction and reinforcing our commitment to delivering sustained value and growth for our shareholders. Upon closing the transaction, we received $911 million, which was concurrently used to repay existing debt. Additionally, as a part of the transaction, we received a 7.5% equity ownership in Amentum, which could rise to 8%. At the same time, Jacob's shareholders became 51% owners in shares of Amentum and their ownership stake could increase up to 55%. I want to take a moment to emphasize how important this transaction is for Jacobs. As a more sharply focused company operating in robust end markets with strong secular growth tailwinds, we believe Jacobs is in an excellent position to create substantial shareholder value. Our simplified structure, global delivery model and ongoing operating efficiencies, positions us nicely to build on a strong end to FY '24. This is a testament to the dedication and relentless efforts of our employees, whose hard work is paving the way forward for two exceptional companies. I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations to each of them for their role in this pivotal transformation. Turning to Slide 5. We provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, with CMS and C&I under discontinued operations. So please note, the results we highlight are related only to continuing operations. Focusing in on the quarter. Total gross revenue increased 4% in Q4, with adjusted net revenue rising 4%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, and includes a positive $1.20 impact from the mark-to-market of our investment in Amentum, netted against the amortization of intangibles, as well as a $0.19 impact from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.37, marking a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 came in at $289 million, which represented a 12% growth versus FY '23. Overall, we are pleased to close out the year with such a positive performance. Looking at the full year. Total gross revenue increased 6% with adjusted net revenue rising 5%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $4.79 and included a positive $0.50 impact, related primarily to the net effect of amortization of acquired intangibles and the mark-to-market of our investment in Amentum, and a negative impact of $1.07 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again, were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $5.28, marking a 16% increase compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for FY '24 was $1.06 billion, representing a 9% increase versus FY '23. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.35 times as our consolidated backlog increased 23% year-on-year in Q4. Fewer metrics will be watched closely and we are encouraged by the trajectory we're delivering on, with an extremely strong 1.67 times book-to-bill for the fourth quarter. When we analyze our backlog, we are seeing this trend across gross revenue and backlog as well as gross profit and backlog, which is a good indicator as we think about our growth for FY '25 and beyond. Turning to Slide 6, and building on my backlog and book-to-bill commentary. I'm excited to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins across the business and across geographies, a testament to our market positioning, deep domain expertise, and long-term trusted client relationships. As we move forward as a simpler and more focused company, we will be providing commentary on revenue across three key end markets, water and environmental, life sciences and advanced manufacturing and critical infrastructure. These end markets roll up to infrastructure and advanced facilities, which is comprised of our historic P&PS business and the retained portion of Divergent Solutions. PA Consulting remains in its own segment and is unchanged. On Slide 14, in the appendix, we provide a graphic that depicts our new structure and end-market focus. Moving on to how our end markets are performing. Water and Environmental is demonstrating impressive growth. Water conveyance, water infrastructure, wastewater, potable reuse and efficient asset management are just some of the key drivers of our client spend. And we have been successful servicing demand across these categories with double-digit growth in Q4. Notably, during Q4, we delivered several key wins, including our appointment by the Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment to provide progressive design build services for the Donald C. Tillman Advanced Water Equalization basins, a critical part of LA's long-term plans to increase recycled water production by 2035. Significantly, this is one of the single largest bookings in the Water and Environmental end market in our company's history. In Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, we continue to see robust demand from Life Sciences clients, boosted by GLP-1 investment, and we expect this trend to continue in FY '25. In Semiconductors, we are diversifying our customer base and expanding our global reach. One example is our recent design win for a new test and assembly facility with CG Semi in India. The facility will manufacture advanced and legacy packages for industries such as automotive, consumer, industrial and 5G communications, and facilitate our strategic positioning in India where electronics manufacturing spend is expected to grow meaningfully. Global investment spending across Life Sciences, Semis and Data Centers is creating a robust backdrop for Jacobs in FY '25 and beyond. Moving on to Critical Infrastructure. During the quarter, we secured a technical project manager role with the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero in the UK. A great example of how we are leveraging our differentiated offering in energy security and transition that demonstrates the power of our partnership and greater collaboration with PA Consulting. We will provide project management and advisory services along with associated strategic support to the Hydrogen and Industrial Carbon Capture program that includes consulting, end-to-end innovation, design and analytics. We are also seeing continued traction in the Middle East as Saudi Vision 2030 significantly increases the number of opportunities across critical infrastructure. Notably, during Q4, we announced a new award to lead advisory, design and engineering for the King Salman International Airport, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Our outlook for near and long-term expansion in the region remains intact and we are seeing signals of strong demand for infrastructure projects across the globe in the early days of FY '25. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to grow the business and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations. We're excited for the future as a more focused company and look forward to presenting our strategic vision for growth over the coming years at our Investor Day, in Miami, on February 18. Now, I'll turn the call over to Venk to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Venk. In closing, as a more focused Enterprise, we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum, in the Water and Environmental, Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, and Critical Infrastructure end markets. And we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across our business, over time. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Thanks, Mike. Sure. So Michael, on the first question, pipeline growth has been really, really strong. If you look at the kind of the big verticals, Water and Environmental up double-digits on a pipeline basis. Advanced Facilities really driven by Life Sciences, we're seeing double-digit growth in that pipeline. And in Critical Infrastructure, which is really driven by transportation. We're seeing a nice comeback on the pipeline, specifically in our European to include the UK and Australia and New Zealand end markets. Middle East continues to grow too. So if you kind of aggregate those, the pipeline looks really, really strong. On the second, don't want to, go too far on the actual number, but I'd say, historically, we would see a certain percentage of -- our next fiscal year revenue in backlog. That percentage is a higher percentage this year. Now, on a 1.67 times book-to-bill, that's not all in one year, that's multiyear booking, but the kind of contracted component for FY '25 is a very strong number. Sure. So, maybe two parts to that question. We kind of see it overall as a net neutral. If we -- if you look at those end markets that were -- now as the new Jacobs honed in on, these are jobs that were either tied to some level of state and local element, which are continuing, kind of think Water and Environmental. And the transportation jobs that we're in the middle of, at a national level in the U.S., have got long tails on them, and we still see the pipeline really strong. So infrastructure wise, we're feeling it's a net neutral. Just as a note, lately been seeing some softness within the federal market. In now our portfolio, about 10% of our business is in that federal market. However, it's -- of that 10%, a majority of that is in DoD and DoD infrastructure, specifically, which we see that pipeline continuing on. Advanced Facilities, continued strong. That industrial reshoring, onshoring, as well as, what's happening in the world of science and technology, specifically in the U.S., we're feeling confident about it. Yeah. So let me answer the last part, Steve, first, and just kind of breaking down those three main areas. And your next question -- your first question. It was a gap, that EV cancellation. So on the AF or the Advanced Facilities component, we do see closing that gap. It would have been closed already, but the future looks very bright there, and represented by our backlog. Water and Environmental, we see continued growth. And on transportation, specifically Critical Infrastructure, what we're seeing in our pipeline as well as Q1. So to be reporting wins in transportation specifically, outside the U.S., is really that gap was outside the U.S. That's already, we've already seen that in real time. Certainty in the budget in the UK is giving us confidence there as well as some really strong wins that we've had in Australia and New Zealand coming out. So we don't really see that gap being a big one. Go, Venk. Sure. And thanks, Andy. So a couple of things. Yeah. It is the most significant book-to-bill that we've had, probably in the history of the company, and really, really proud of that. The Life Sciences and the Water bookings that we've had are large, and they're multiyear. And so, they're not any -- and they're not -- they're not degrading (ph) to margins. These are at and in certain cases above our kind of corporate margins that we've demonstrated here in the last few quarters. So it's the multi-year component of that, that is driving the revenue guidance. And we also gave, room on the mid to high-single digits to kind of compensate for the bell shaped curve on a project lifecycle too. So, like we -- we're feeling really good. These are some of the largest bookings that we've had, and I think I mentioned in the script, in the history of the company, which kind of goes through the testament of our market positioning right now. No, absolutely. It's a very important question, and thanks for asking it. I'd say second half, you're going to see a significant decay. And '26, short answer, yes. Yes, being clean, yeah. Thanks, Andy. Yeah, Saba. My answer was really -- was based on our clients activity. And going back to, any type of potential delays that happened as a result of the election, those would -- we don't feel like those would pertain to these jobs that are going forward at the state and local level, supporting some pretty large events that are happening in Los Angeles and in other venues around the world, specifically on the Water and Transportation side. And then, on the Advanced Facility side, these are commitments that our clients have made to the end markets on some pretty, pretty critical therapies that the world needs. So these are tied to global trends that are probably a little segregated from what might happen with regards to churn in the Beltway. So those were two, separate. Sure. So, let me kind of breakdown the question here. On the two geographies, is -- and actually -- look this -- this comment is going to apply to every single one of our geographies. We are in the locales that we're in to service those local clients. And so, just on that element, with regards to the UK and the Middle East, those are strong markets. And yes, there's -- there are economic ebbs and flows in those markets. But our client base, especially now with our kind of our focus portfolio, these are long-term kind of trends. So any kind of near-term oscillations, if you look at it on the long-term, they're solid. And in the UK, in the Middle East, we're seeing some nice tailwinds that they're coming back and might not be as strong as 10 years ago or before. But compared to recent times, we're seeing some of that come through. How do we gauge that? We gauge that through our pipeline, and we're seeing our pipeline grow. And so, those -- kind of on that. Water in the UK never slowed down. So really the upside that we're talking about is more honed in on transportation as well as some of our Advanced Facilities world. But the key is that us staying in those geographies is really more about our talent, and that talent ends up addressing both the local market, but also there's some really, really key talent that we have in UK, Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, that are being deployed around the world. So that talent piece is really, really key in how we think about our global model. On the elections, we -- again, we don't think that that is going to affect, what we're talking about as far as the strength in the end markets. And so, we stand behind the numbers we put out. Hi. Good morning. Sure. Why don't I answer the first one and then Venk will address kind of the confidence in revenue growth coming in the year. As far as the margins go, we continue to see -- during -- even during, the run-up to the election in the UK as well as other areas that PA has a presence, the margins have stayed true and the team has done a really good job at continuing to focus in on higher value as well as strength of the offering that they have for their clients. So we don't -- we see that margin profile continuing, moving forward. Venk, you want to talk about the revenue growth? And their PA -- then their -- and their backlog grew at the same rate as ours did. No, Sangita. That's the way it came across if that wasn't the case. We had some flattening growth outside the U.S. in our infrastructure end markets. We're talking about that inflecting forward. Within the U.S., those numbers have been positive -- for the last fiscal year. We do. And we're seeing that in our pipeline right now growing as well as our book-to-bill and the double-digit growth that we've had in backlog. Yeah. I don't know if I would use the word fungible, but they're very deployable, and work on -- work all over the world, both in the U.S., outside the U.S., and from outside the U.S., in. It's really important to understand, the mix of our people in the U.S. and outside the U.S. does not map to our U.S. versus non-U.S. revenue stream. And so that is a very balanced look on how we utilize our people around the world. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning, Chad. It would be if the -- if we see an acceleration in the jobs we're on. That heavy, heavy focus now from the backlog growth coming from our Water as well as Life Sciences sector is, those could be accelerated and we could find ourselves, on the higher end of that range. So, we're watching that very closely. Thank you. Yeah. Jerry, it's a great question. I'd say that the operating model is in full effect right now. You're right, we got out ahead of that during the course of the year. I think the biggest change has been getting back to where we came from where we were externally focused on our clients' business. And that has really come to the core of how we think about the world. And instead of being internally focused on, some of the transactions that we were doing, whether they'd be over the course of the last couple of years or leading up to this quarter. So that's been the real change, understanding our clients' business and we're seeing it in our sales performance in Q3 and Q4 of last year. So, we're excited because those actions and those behaviors are turning into a 22% backlog growth at a 1.67 times book-to-bill. And that's kind of -- the proof is in the numbers. So, we're excited. Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Look forward to providing further updates and visiting with investors and analysts in the coming weeks and months. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Venk Nathamuni",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good day, everyone. We are pleased with our Q4 performance, which contributed to a strong year. Let me now begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slides 7 and 8. Starting on Slide 7, we show quarterly results, and I'll provide additional context and detail around our performance from continuing operations. As Bob noted, CMS and C&I have been excluded from our results as those businesses are listed under discontinued operations. We provide a reconciliation on Page 24 in the appendix, that will allow you to compare results for the enterprise, including the businesses that were separated in the fourth quarter. Notably, I want to highlight, that in total, we did outpace the $7.95 adjusted EPS midpoint for fiscal '24 that we guided to with Q3 results. However, from here forth, we will only be discussing continuing operations. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 4% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes the impact of pass-through revenue, also grew 4%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $289 million, growing 12% year-over-year to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.6%, which is an increase of approximately 100 basis points from last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.37, marking a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Please note that during the quarter, GAAP EPS benefited from a $187 million pre-tax gain associated with the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Amentum with no benefit to adjusted EPS. Additionally, PA Consulting contributed $0.10 of EPS dilution to GAAP EPS from periodic fair value change impacts on our redeemable non-controlling interest balances, and this impact was added back to adjusted EPS in Q4. We provide a walk-through of our adjusted EPS calculation for continuing operations on Slide 23. Finally, consolidated backlog was up almost 23% year-over-year to $21.8 billion. The trailing 12-month revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.35 times, with our gross profit and backlog increasing 12% year-over-year. As Bob noted earlier, this is an encouraging data point as we look ahead to fiscal '25. The Q4 book-to-bill of 1.67 times, though partly a function of higher pass-through revenue, is still very positive and helped us end the year on a high note. Moving on to Slide 8, I'll recap fiscal '24 results. Fiscal '24 total gross revenue increased 6% year-over-year, with adjusted net revenue rising 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% as a function of higher revenue and just over 40 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 16% year-on-year. We're pleased to end fiscal '24 in a strong position with solid organic revenue growth, double-digit EPS growth and a backlog that sets us up for continued growth in fiscal '25 and beyond. Regarding the performance of our end markets in the quarter, let's now turn to Slide 9. As Bob noted earlier, we're reporting our business as Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, and PA Consulting, and we will discuss revenue trends in our three key end markets. This should provide helpful context to supplement our overall results. We'll focus on adjusted net revenue in our discussion as we believe this is a better indicator of business trends as it excludes pass-through revenues. However, we do list gross revenue growth across each end market for your reference. In Water and Environmental, growth was solid, with adjusted net revenue increasing 13% versus the same quarter last year. Water and Environmental demand has been strong and we expect that to continue in fiscal '25 based on our current backlog and pipeline. Encouragingly, demand is being driven by multiple geographies, with North America, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, all growing double digits in the quarter. Our Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing end market revenue grew 3% in Q4, with strength partially offset by an unfavorable revenue adjustment related to an EV battery manufacturer customer bankruptcy in Europe. Our outlook for this end market is for Life Sciences to be the primary driver of revenue growth in fiscal '25 as capital investment from our Life Sciences customers remains robust. We're also seeing our customer base broaden in Semis and the AI data center opportunity is expanding. As we look into fiscal '25 and beyond, we anticipate top-line growth in this end market, not only from rising industry investment, but also differentiation through our cross-cutting Water and Energy capabilities. In Critical Infrastructure, adjusted net revenue increased 1%, with North America showing steady growth, while certain international markets have lagged. We expect to see improvement across critical infrastructure in fiscal '25, with our backlog and pipeline underpinning a strong recovery as transportation project demand is rising. Putting this all together, we have line of sight to maintaining strong revenue growth in Water and Environmental and increasing our growth rates in Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, as well as Critical Infrastructure end markets in the coming year relative to Q4. Now moving on to Slide 10, I will provide a quick overview of our segment financials. We saw strong trends in Q4 for Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities operating profit, which increased 12% year-over-year in total and 12% on a constant currency basis. In fiscal '24, operating profit increased 9% year-over-year and 9% on a constant currency basis. Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities results were aided by both revenue growth and margin expansion. Moving on to PA Consulting, results reflect modest top-line growth, but good execution on the bottom-line. Q4 operating profit increased 4% year-over-year and fiscal '24 operating profit increased 1%. Both were slightly negative on a constant currency basis. However, we are encouraged by recent bookings and anticipate that growth will trend higher in fiscal '25. Moving on to Slide 11, we provide an overview of cash generation and balance sheet data. For fiscal '24, free cash flow from continuing operations was strong at $718 million and enabled us to repurchase $403 million in shares and pay $143 million in cash dividends. We also paid down debt and ended the year with roughly $1.1 billion in net debt, which represented a net leverage ratio of 1.0 times on LTM adjusted EBITDA. This is at the low end of our 1.0 times to 1.5 times target. Our balance sheet strength will enable continued investment in the business as well as returns to shareholders through share repurchases and long-term dividend growth. We currently have $472 million in remaining authorization under our repurchase program, and recently declared a dividend of $0.29, a 12% increase year-over-year. And finally, please turn to Slide 12 for our fiscal '25 outlook. We expect adjusted net revenue to increase mid to high-single digits year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8% to 14%, adjusted EPS to range from $5.80 to $6.20, and reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%. We will have cash outflows related to restructuring of $75 million to $95 million in fiscal 2025, with that impact declining through fiscal '25. The midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS would indicate about 14% growth year-over-year, and the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA would indicate approximately 15% growth year-over-year, highlighting our strong outlook for business performance this year. We provide relevant assumptions on the right side of the page to help you with your modeling. One item to be mindful of is our projected tax rate of approximately 26%. Our fiscal '25 tax rate is expected to be several points higher than in fiscal '24 and fiscal '23, and is a function of multiple discrete tax benefits in those historical periods that are not expected to recur. Despite the higher tax rate, we will still anticipate strong adjusted EPS growth in fiscal '25. I'd note, from a trend perspective, we expect to start fiscal '25 with Q1 revenue adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings below Q4 of fiscal '24, reflecting typical seasonality. However, as we progress through fiscal '25, we expect to see sequential growth in our financial results through Q4. Overall, we're excited about the future of Jacobs and are entering fiscal '25 in a strong position financially, with positive underlying momentum in the business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob. Thank you, Mike. Yeah. Thank you, Steve. So a couple of questions. So one on the, the overall cost structure. As you can tell, we made a pretty significant progress in fiscal '24 in terms of our operating margin and EBITDA margin expansion. And I would say there's still room there in terms of improving the margins over time, and that's why we guided to 100 basis point increase year-on-year for fiscal '25. And if you look at the various parts of it, clearly, from the standpoint of operational efficiency, we still have room there. We've had a -- we'll have a full year of what you call annualization of operating efficiencies, because lot of it happened, towards the second half of fiscal '24. You'll see a lot of that manifest in its entirety in fiscal '25. And then, overall, cost controls is something that we are focused on. And last but not least, we are continuing to improve our mix of our business as well as how we implement these projects from a global connectivity standpoint. So, multiple facets to this margin story over time. And then your second question about restructuring. So as you pointed out, we did have restructuring in fiscal '24. Clearly, as you know, we have a commitment to Amentum to continue to do our transition services, that will last maybe another two, three quarters. So, we should see a pretty dramatic decline in our restructuring, going from fiscal '24 to fiscal '25, and we've quantified it in the range of $75 million to $95 million. Obviously, we'll try to do our best to make sure that marks the end of our restructuring in a meaningful way. Yeah. And then, the other part of the restructuring is obviously having, some ownership of liability with the PA Consulting business as well. Thank you. And Saba, if I could add, the range that we've provided, from our guidance perspective, we try to guide for what we think is the most likely outcome. And obviously, as Bob alluded to, it depends on the profile of the customer burn and so forth. And so that's what's imputed in our guidance. And that's why we provided the range to -- in the mid to high-single digits for revenue growth. Yeah, absolutely. So in terms of just revenue growth for the PA Consulting business, we -- we've had good insight into their pipeline, especially over the last several quarters. And we're feeling pretty good about the inflection point in PA's business in terms of the growth really coming together in fiscal '25. Now, when we provided the high level guidance for our overall revenue growth of mid to high-single digits, that certainly imputes PA Consulting also, providing that growth acceleration from the prior year. So, all of that is taken into account as we give our overall guidance for all of, PA Consulting plus Jacobs, and we feel that there is certainly an inflection point in fiscal '25 with regards to the growth from PA Consulting. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. No, great question. So first of all, and I'd like to reiterate that, as I mentioned in the script, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders in form of buybacks and dividends, and we return almost 60% of free cash flow in fiscal '24. So, we're continuing to commit to a significant portion of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders. On top of it, as you pointed out, we have been paying down debt. We did get about $911 million in Amentum proceeds on day one of the transaction, which we then used to pay down debt. And we do still have a 7.5% to 8% retained stake that we hope to monetize in the first half of calendar '25. And then beyond that, as I look at the capital allocation priorities for us, we -- there's a lot of excitement about organic growth opportunities in the business, so number one priority will continue to be investing in the organic growth of the business. Number two, as I said before, is returning, cash to shareholders in form of both dividends and buybacks, and we're committed to that. And then, finally, from an M&A perspective, certainly, that is an accelerant for us in the long term. We'll talk a lot more about it during Investor Day, but suffice it to say that we have lots of optionality with the balance sheet position that we have, the significant free cash flow that we generate, and our ability to return that to shareholders as well. Thank you. Yeah, Chad, thanks for those questions. So, I'd say the, look, first on the end markets, the way we model our business is to obviously go after the best opportunities that we have across those different end markets and continue to focus on top-line growth, but also in this way that optimizes margin so that it meets our corporate average, right? So, in any given quarter, any given in the first half or second half of the year, we can certainly have ups and downs with regards to the margin profiles. But what we try to optimize for is the good balance between, continued revenue growth as well as -- gross margins and operating margins improving over time. And that's what we've quantified in terms of our expectation for fiscal '25. So, I wouldn't say one business is any different from another from the standpoint of the optimization. But certainly, we want to continue to focus on profitable revenue growth such that both our revenue as well as the margins expand over time. So that's more work. And then going to your second question about cost savings, as I alluded to in response to a previous question, we have made significant strides in terms of improving the operating efficiency, but you had just six months of that take effect in fiscal '24. So we'll have the annualization of operating efficiencies take full effect in fiscal '25, and that's part of the margin expansion story for us. But it's not just that. I mean, in addition to it, as I mentioned before, we are optimizing our go-to-market, we're optimizing, our global connectivity, and so forth. So we do see a multi-year trend in terms of, focusing on improving our profitability over time, not just on the cost side, but certainly from a business mix standpoint as well as from an efficiency standpoint. Yeah, Jerry. Thank you for the question. And yes, certainly, we feel good about the margin expansion for fiscal '25 that I alluded to both in the prepared remarks as well as in response to a couple of questions. And as we look-ahead beyond fiscal '25, certainly, we'll provide you a lot more clarity when it comes to Investor Day, not just in terms of our revenue growth and, end market mix as well, but also in terms of capital allocation and margin expansion story. So, suffice it to say that we do feel good about our margin expansion in fiscal '25, and beyond that, we'll cover in more detail. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Solutions Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ayan Banerjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Ayan, you may begin your conference.\nAyan Banerjee: Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will refer during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; Special Adviser to the CEO, Kevin Berryman; as well as our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and then summarizing highlights from our third quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics. Venk will then provide a review of our balance sheet and cash flow and provide comments around our guidance and Investor Day. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I will turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Ayan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I'm joined today by my Special Adviser, Kevin Berryman, who acted as Interim CFO into June, and will therefore report our financials. I'm delighted to also welcome our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni, on his first earnings call for Jacobs. Venk joined us in June and will provide details on guidance. Venk brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise from his 30-plus year career, and I am excited to work in partnership with him moving forward. Kevin will continue in his role as special adviser to me to drive a successful conclusion to the separation and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses with the Amentum. I'd like to extend my gratitude for Kevin for our ongoing support. Now moving to Slide 4. We continue to make progress on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value, higher margin portfolio and remain confident in driving margin expansion over the coming years. Turning to Slide 5. I am pleased to report significant progress on the previously announced planned spin-off of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses. An updated Form-10 was publicly filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing made under Amazon Holdco, Inc. includes important business and financial information about the intended merger with Amentum to create a leading publicly traded global government services provider. Amentum will provide additional details during their Capital Markets Day on Tuesday, August 13, 2024. The transaction is now anticipated to be completed in the second half of September 2024. Turning to Slide 6 and Q3. I will now share our third quarter achievements, highlighted by strong backlog growth, consolidated margin expansion and P&PS record backlog and strong adjusted operating margin. This period saw a continuation of a mix shift to higher-margin science-based consulting and advisory services that offers significantly higher returns, contributing to an overall margin expansion, notably led by P&PS and our partnership with PA Consulting. We are seeing an accelerating demand for critical infrastructure, particularly in water, environmental and advanced facilities end markets, which are poised for substantial growth. Consolidated backlog increased 6% year-over-year bolstering confidence that our business will accelerate profitable growth as we strategically shift our portfolio to higher value, higher margin solutions. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA came in at $392 million, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period last year and representing 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. From a cash perspective, we started the second half of the year by delivering very strong operating cash flow of $483 million and free cash flow of $445 million. We continue to expect exceeding 100% reported free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024, underscoring the power of our business model. Turning to Slide 7. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another -- of solid top line growth, along with strong adjusted operating margins of 15.3% and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% year-on-year. We ended Q3 with a strong book-to-bill of 1.53x and record backlog. Adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS -- solid P&PS organic revenue growth for Q4 fiscal year 2024. I'm particularly pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins in core sectors such as water, environmental and advanced facilities, a testament to our robust market positioning, deep domain expertise and long-term trusted client relationships. We achieved double-digit growth in our water and environmental markets with two thirds of our water-related business focused in on high-value science-based consulting and advisory services, driven by aging infrastructure and emerging PFAS regulations. Water continues to be a foundational element of our portfolio, exemplified by key wins across various geographies, reinforcing our global leadership in the sector. Europe, particularly the UK, has shown resilience, posting a robust quarter in water-related awards. In Asia, we were appointed by PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency to engineer and program manage the new Kranji Water Reclamation Plant designed to enhance Northern Singapore's water treatment capacity by 120 million imperial gallons per day. Additionally, our partnership with Onondaga County, the Syracuse metropolitan area in Central New York, which began in 2008, continues as they've chosen us to provide program management services for their efforts in controlling increased combined sewer outflow and utilizes our Digital OneWater solutions. This expansion will be critical in remediating aging water infrastructure and supporting industrial growth in the geography. We're excited by the continued momentum in pipeline build in our advanced facilities portfolio, predominantly driven by life sciences, semiconductor manufacturing and AI chip driven data center expansion. Specifically in life sciences, we continue to see robust growth with our pipeline and revenue growing double digits year-over-year. Approximately two thirds of our life sciences related business is concentrated in high-value science-based consulting and advisory services. We were selected by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies to support the $1.2 billion expansion of their large-scale biologics facility -- biologics manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina, providing engineering, procurement and program management services with the first phase of construction expected to complete in 2025. We continue to see a growing pipeline in transportation and energy and power supported by ongoing government stimulus. As an example, in transportation, we were selected to provide program management services for Broward County Transportation Department's first-ever public transit expansion. This $4.4 billion 30-year initiative will transform the county's transportation infrastructure into a multimodal transit system with a new light rail connecting Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport to Port Everglades. Additionally, the quarter was highlighted by several key wins in the energy and sustainability space as demonstrated by our appointment as program manager for the ARCHES Hydrogen Consortium and master service agreement with Shell Energy in Australia. PA Consulting delivered an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 21.8% with robust execution and cost discipline. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator in our science-based consulting and advisory services. Together with PA, we were selected in the Hertfordshire County, UK to enhance the public highways network in the county with services valued at approximately $22 million annually. This collaboration focuses on sustainability and aims to deliver long-term value over an initial five-year period with potential extensions up to 14 years. In Divergent Solutions, we are encouraged by the ongoing demand for our digitally enabled infrastructure solutions that will remain with independent Jacobs post close. A testament to our capabilities is our recent selection by the City of Omaha to develop a data analytics and AI-enabled support system for its wastewater network, utilizing Jacobs Digital OneWater Solutions, Aqua DNA. CMS delivered 35 basis points of margin expansion, the highest in 10 quarters and has a strong pipeline. Additionally, we're experiencing encouraging trends that support long-term growth as we approach the merger with Amentum. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to win higher value, higher-margin solutions and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q3 results, leading to another solid quarter. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 8. Third quarter gross revenue grew 1% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue also grew 1%. GAAP operating profit was $260 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $73 million of transaction, restructuring and other costs including $62 million associated with the separation transaction. We now expect our total restructuring costs to be approximately $300 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by higher separation transaction costs associated with our anticipated close now targeted during the second half of September 2024. Our adjusted operating margin was again a strong 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.17 per share and included a $0.31 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.49 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.96, marking an 11% increase compared to the previous year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $392 million and was up 11% year-over-year, representing an 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. Finally, consolidated backlog was up 6% year-over-year and the revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.29x with our gross profit and backlog increasing 5.5% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 9. Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year with adjusted operating profit up 12%. Our mix shift mentioned earlier, resulted in higher margins on lower revenue growth. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% was up 95 basis points year-over-year. Our backlog grew by 10% year-over-year, while gross profit in backlog grew 9%. This quarter's critical wins underscore our strength in water, environmental and advanced facilities, reinforcing our leadership position in these key markets. These wins translated into a book-to-bill of 1.53x and a record backlog, as previously mentioned by Bob. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q3 revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, while backlog was up 4%. Excluding the announced contract loss mentioned in the prior quarter, our revenue would have been up slightly year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit was up 1.2% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 35 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%, the highest margin in 10 quarters as the business continues to drive operational improvements and margin-enhancing client-facing projects. Shifting to Divergent Solutions. Q3 saw an 11% year-over-year dip in adjusted net revenue and a 40% year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating profit, driven by a one-time year-to-date government rate adjustment and the space-based ISR program delays that were mentioned in the prior quarter. Despite the strategic shift in funding with the DoD, we continue to see positive momentum in our space-based ISR technology adoption leading to pipeline build and expected future backlog growth. Now let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q3 saw a modest increase in year-over-year revenue. However, PA delivered a strong adjusted operating margin of 21.8%, reflecting a 60 basis point improvement from the previous year. Our margin results this quarter exceeded our expectations and reinforces our confidence in sustaining a strong margin profile as we continue to expect 20% plus margins in Q4. Backlog increased 4% year-over-year, and we expect improved growth as we enter fiscal year 2025. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $61 million in Q3, and we continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model to drive costs down. Finally, I am very excited to welcome Venk to the team. We've been working together closely and I -- and we have made great progress on ensuring a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn the call over to Venk.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you, Kevin. Let me begin by saying I'm very excited to be part of the Jacobs team and a special thanks to Kevin for his partnership and support. I'll now provide a quick overview of our balance sheet and cash flow metrics, followed by consolidated full year guidance. Turning to Slide 10. We posted a strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. We generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $445 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow conversion was well above 100%, leading to a full year expectation of greater than 100%. Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $151 million of shares during the quarter, which was up $55 million compared to Q2, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We have $528 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we've stated before, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion and our Q3 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.1x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt remaining current in the fiscal year. We have ample options, refinancing as well as using proceeds from the expected separation transaction for repaying the current amounts. As of the end of Q3, approximately 37% of our debt was tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. On the dividend front, we remain committed to growing our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29 and 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on August 2023. Now turning to Slide 11. Given the solid execution thus far, we're narrowing our consolidated adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $7.85 to $8.05, representing 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of the $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion range. This guidance incorporates Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.96 and approximately 27% adjusted effective tax rate for the remainder of this fiscal year. Additionally, this represents 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year-ago period. Our expectation is that the ongoing positive momentum in our business will lead to increased revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 compared to our current levels. Once we close the separation transaction, we anticipate an immediate shift in our company's growth profile, positioning us solidly for higher growth and higher margins. As Bob mentioned earlier, the anticipated separation transaction close date is now in the second half of September 2024. As a result, we expect Q3 to be the last quarter in which the results of the separated businesses will be included in our continuing operations. Beginning next quarter, we expect our results for our continuing operations to reflect the new independent Jacobs. Historical results for independent Jacobs will be available following the close of the transaction. And lastly, we're excited to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day for independent Jacobs on February 18, 2025, in Miami, Florida. We look forward to sharing our long-term strategy as well as our financial target model with the investor community during this event. Additional details will be forthcoming, and we look forward to your participation. And with that, now I'll turn the call back to Bob.\nBob Pragada: Thank you, Venk. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market, and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen, and welcome. Thanks.\nBob Pragada: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you. Yes. Maybe just first to talk about your improvement in the gross margins in the P&PS backlog that you reported this quarter up 9%. Maybe a characteristic of the mix impact, is there any industries or end markets that have contributed more to that? And I guess as my follow-up, as you're looking towards fiscal 2025 and the pipeline you have and a very strong book-to-bill you had, how confident do you believe that you can show backlog and net revenue organic growth moving ahead into 2025, given where your position is today with your backlog and pipeline?\nBob Pragada: Sure. Mike, maybe I'll address both. I'd say, yes, the gross profit and backlog is definitely being positively affected by two elements: one, our service mix; and second, the end market sector mix. And so on the service mix, I mentioned a couple of times, we are really seeing a fundamental shift in our profile with regards to higher-end science-based consulting and advisory services. And that's not only showing up in our results from a burn profile but also in the backlog. The profile of the backlog is right now at a point in time, heavily weighted towards water as well as in advanced facilities, predominantly life sciences. And those two have a higher margin profile as well, so both are having a positive effect on that. With regards to FY 2025, we were looking forward to potentially another strong Q4 backlog performance, booking and backlog performance leading to confidence in our revenue growth in FY 2025. So, definitely some nice tailwinds there.\nMichael Dudas: That's great, Bob. Thanks, sir. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hi, good morning everyone.\nBob Pragada: Hi, good morning, Andy.\nVenk Nathamuni: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So Bob, Venk, or Kevin, can you give us a bit more color into the guidance towards the lower end of your annual EBITDA range you just said? What changed versus last quarter? Obviously, your margin has been very good. So you're seeing delays in backlog burning, which is hurting your revenue. Anything else that you could give us in terms of color?\nBob Pragada: Yes. Go ahead, Venk.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. Andy, yes, thanks for the question. So I'd say a few moving parts as it relates to the EBITDA performance. So obviously, from the standpoint of EPS, we came in kind of the midpoint of the range as we guided to. Now as far as the EBITDA is concerned, we did allude to the fact that there were a couple of segments that were weaker than we expected. One was obviously the CMS, the Cytec loss that was announced in the prior quarter and then some of the DVS delays that Bob alluded to in his earnings script. But I would say at a higher level, when you look at the difference between the EBITDA performance and the EPS performance, clearly, we had a little bit of a tax benefit that helped us on the EPS front. And then obviously, as you also know, we reported a pretty significant stock buyback so that reduced the share count as well. So I'd say the difference between the EBITDA and EPS is primarily due to those two items. But what I would also point to is that if you look at the P&PS backlog, we feel pretty good about where our profile of that business is heading towards, both from a revenue growth standpoint as well as the margin standpoint.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then Bob, Venk, or Kevin, you kept the 13.8% plus FY 2025 standalone margin guidance intact for now, but obviously, your People & Places margin has been much higher than expected so far this year. So how do you think about that target at this point? Could there be considerable upside to that target? And then when you think about RemainCo sales, I know you said you expect a pretty good year next year. But any reason why you couldn't expect that sort of 6% to 9% growth for People & Places at least that you've been talking about?\nBob Pragada: Yes. So maybe the first one with regards to confidence going into FY 2025, Andy. There was a reason why we put the plus. Clearly, some moving parts right now with regards to the separation. So timing was another element that we want to consider. Performance has been solid. So I would just -- I'd characterize it as some tailwinds that we've got going into FY 2025, and we'll be really clear about that as we move into -- in the next phase, but confidence overall. Andy, remind me again the second half of the question?\nAndy Kaplowitz: Because you've got a consulting what have you, but how do you think about sort of the visibility toward the core infrastructure growth in 2025?\nBob Pragada: Yes. Sorry about that. So yes, good visibility there. During the quarter, we -- strong tailwinds in water and advanced facilities in the areas where there was a little bit of maybe some slight -- not decay, but pause, I'd say, in the UK with regards to transport and the election and then the reprioritization of some shifts in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi. Those haven't gone away. And now with the election in the UK as well as some clarity on programs moving forward in Saudi, those also service some positive tailwinds on a mix standpoint going into FY 2025.\nVenk Nathamuni: And Andy, if I could, I would say just in terms of just what we see ahead clearly, from a Q4 booking standpoint, there's still some good confidence about the strength of those bookings. But in terms of specifics, we'll obviously provide you fiscal 2025 guidance in the next earnings call. And then we look forward to providing a much more long-term guidance, both in terms of the revenue growth as well as our profitability profile when we have the Investor Day in February. Thank you for your questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. I'm not sure if this one would be something you would say for that Investor Day, but really just trying to think about what's the right framework for profit growth year-over-year in P&PS since Bob, you mentioned that you're going to accelerate the profitable growth. I mean, is the framework here any different than sort of the mid- to upper single-digit revenue growth and then some of this margin mix gets you to low double-digit profit growth? Or is something more like mid-teens possible given that you are accelerating these large awards and some of the mix dynamics?\nBob Pragada: Yes. I think it's early, Steve. We're going to go through all of that in some details, but we're really excited about the tailwinds that we see for FY 2025, specifically in all subsectors of the infrastructure market and facilities, but we remain very positive.\nSteven Fisher: Okay, fair enough. And then just to follow up on the corporate expenses. Just to kind of -- can you just give us an update on how much more clarity you have to the path of hitting the target rate that you have and maybe what the next couple of quarters that you have embedded in there in that trajectory?\nKevin Berryman: Well, Look, Steven, I think it's clear that we're going to have a different reporting structure as Venk highlighted once the transaction closes. So the numbers that you will see in the corporate line will start to change, and we're working through all the recurring segments and all that kind of information for the full year reporting. So you may not see exactly the same number going forward, but you will fundamentally on an apples-to-apples basis, that $60 million, we expect will trend down to $50 million over time. And they embedded into a consolidated result for the company and so you may not see it broken out separately. But that's going to help drive towards that 13.8% EBITDA margin that was just asked going forward. So we feel good about it. Some of that cost will have to be targeted after separation because we still have two businesses to run so -- or three, I should say, with PA. And so more to come on that, but we feel confident about the necessary cost reductions that allow us to get to the 13.8% EBITDA margin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSabahat Khan: Great, thanks and good morning. You talked a little. You mentioned a bit of a -- the ongoings in the UK a little bit. Can you just maybe talk about just the flow of the projects you're seeing across some of the markets, maybe particularly kind of the U.S. and the UK, obviously, a lot of elections going on? Are there puts and takes globally? Just is that trending in line with what you would have anticipated at the beginning of the year? Just any color there would be great.\nBob Pragada: Yes. A couple of comments. Let me start kind of with the U.S. and then work my way around. I'd say in the U.S., the flow of bid activity and pipeline across infrastructure and advanced facility, that hasn't slowed. I'd say the burn rate of some of our U.S. transport work has been a little slower from a burn standpoint, but the level of opportunities have been there. In water, I'd say globally, we have seen some real positive momentum both on bookings as well as burn and that's across all geographies. U.S., Europe to include the UK, Middle East and our Asia Pac and ANZ area. So water has been in that realm as well as advanced facilities really driven by life sciences. So I'd say that just the two areas that we saw as a part of the election in the UK pause was transport. Water kept going in the UK and then the reprioritization in Saudi with regards to some of the event-driven cities oriented work moving more towards the time-based work like the Expo or the airport or infrastructure that's going to be needed with a time element to that in 2026 leading to the Expo and the FIFA World Cup. So these are things that we're continuing to add optimism as we move into Q4 and beyond.\nSabahat Khan: Great. And then if you can maybe just follow up on the commentary around the water, I broadly heard that the demand in that space has been growing. Can you maybe just talk about your win rate in that space, any particular areas within the broader water market where you might have been winning an outsized amount of work? And if I could maybe just talk about the progress you've made with AMP8 in terms of any opportunities there that you might have secured.\nBob Pragada: Sure. So as far as again what's driving it, clearly, the aging infrastructure is a big piece. The other piece is around combined sewer overflows and what's happening with regards to climate and some of the natural disasters that we're seeing. So I'd say that's accelerating what's going on as well. In the drinking water component, we are seeing an increase in PFAS -- in addressing the PFAS regulations, specifically in the U.S., but also in Germany and in other locations, too. So that's all kind of driving that. Just to quantify it, Sabahat, our pipeline in the water sector is up nearly 2x as it pertains to this time last year. And we are winning a majority of the work that we're going after, hence, the real attention and focus on the growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAndy Wittmann: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to get a little clarification on the gross profit in backlog. I guess your total backlog was up 6% year-over-year and your gross profit in backlog was up 5.5%. So that suggests that the overall backlog has a little bit lower margin in it. I guess we've established that the P&PS segment margin is up. So I was wondering what the offset and what segments they are? And if you could talk about the mix in those and what occurred there so we can understand the complexion there a little bit better. I think that would be helpful.\nBob Pragada: Andy, maybe just -- I'll let Kevin kind of clarify the nuances within the backlog, and then I'll talk about kind of the profile as it pertains to the various end markets and we can talk about that profile.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, so what we're seeing is we've been talking about the growth profile in People & Places top line wise and being a little bit more muted because effectively we're seeing more consulting science-based technology, technical and consulting work that's happening. In the backlog and the book-to-bill, very strong book-to-bill is some other types of projects, which include lower margin work, which will, at the same time, create accelerated good top line growth. So it will be a little bit of a reduction in mix relative to the consulting piece versus our current levels. And at the end of the day, it's going to be quite positive because we'll still see, I think, incremental margin over time in People & Places because we've proven our ability to do that. And we're going to see some accelerated growth as well associated with some of these larger, I'm going to call it, projects that involve program management and extended dollars being spent, which will include a little bit greater percentage of pass-through revenue, which has more limited margin than the high-value consulting work that we do.\nBob Pragada: Yes. And Andy, maybe I'll just extend on that last thought that Kevin had. So then if you break that, you cited the consolidated numbers on the 6% and the 5.5% in gross profit. If you then translate that into P&PS, which relates to the last comment that Kevin made, that looks like more like 10% on the top line and 9% on gross profit. So you can kind of see the dynamic leaning towards P&PS is growing at a much higher rate.\nAndy Wittmann: Got it. Okay. Yes, that actually makes sense. So, that's helpful. I wanted to also just get an update, Bob, just on some of the actions you're taking in preparation for the split. I know you're looking at how your organization works and where the real cost centers are and the benefit centers are. Can you talk about any things that you've actioned to date that we should know about in terms of how you've changed your business model in anticipation of that forthcoming split, things that you're able to do now before you're able to actually effectuate that deal?\nBob Pragada: Yes, absolutely. So we really looked at in a consolidated company, what type of corporate needs are going to be needed on more of a homogenous corporate needs are a lot more synchronized across the world. So those movements to global business centers and real streamlining of process protocols and systematic enhancements. Those have been taking place in real time. From a business standpoint, we've already started to transition into optimizing on a lot of our cross-cutting capabilities, program management, digital enablement and other strong sales, market-leading sales functions that will cut across the entirety of the company. So the geographic nuance client-facing entities with cross-cutting capabilities, that structure, it's almost like being in -- with the being the Olympic time right now, it's already in that zone where we're handing off the baton in that section, we're already off and running.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Hi, good morning.\nBob Pragada: Hi, Bert. Good morning.\nVenk Nathamuni: Good morning.\nBert Subin: Bob, maybe just to start with you, you had some comments on the advanced facility side. It sounds like life sciences has continued to be really strong, and you mentioned AI data centers, which I feel like is more of like a newer area for you guys in terms of that growing. I didn't hear the semi side. Can you just give some context on sort of what the mix there looks like? I mean, I know Intel reported and said they're taking down their CapEx. So like what the expectation is as we move through into maybe in the 2025 for advanced facilities and how it's performing today?\nBob Pragada: Sure. So specifically on semis, Bert, we've been working on this for a while. So clearly, we do, do a lot of work for Intel, and that work is fundamentally on that CapEx program that they highlighted three or four years ago. We had substantially worked our way through that. And so the news that's come out has got a minimal effect on us. The diversification of our services that we perform for Intel, those kind of ongoing sustaining capital work that we do around tool installs and retrofits and layout dependent type work, that will continue. So -- but the good news is that our diversification into memory customers as well as other logic customers that are doing work in the U.S. and in Europe, that's continued, and we'll have, hopefully, some good news to share next quarter on that as well as some of the geographic expansion that's going on in places like India. And so we have some really positive momentum going on, on that front. So overall we're still bullish on the sector, and we'll continue to accelerate growth.\nBert Subin: And then in the life sciences\u2026\nBob Pragada: And then on life sciences, yes, that's really going well right now. And it's probably a lot of discussion around GLP-1. But what we're seeing is Alzheimer's and oncology drugs still making a really big play. So the two big players that are in the GLP-1 sector, that is a big part of our work, but the new awards that are coming through, whether they be in the contract manufacturing space or in these other players that are -- have got a really nice pipeline of drugs coming into oncology as well as in Alzheimer's. Those are -- that's really driving that optimism too.\nVenk Nathamuni: And Bert, if I could, just having most recently come from the semiconductor sector, we do see this as a secular trend in terms of where the manufacturing footprint is and across different realms of semiconductors and logic and memory, as Bob alluded to, and there's also a geographical shift that's happening. So as we look at our portfolio, we have good confidence that we are pretty well diversified. And then just the scope of the opportunities in front of us are still pretty good. Now obviously, any given quarter, it depends on what happens to the market. But I think if you look at it from a secular standpoint, we feel pretty good about our semiconductor footprint.\nBert Subin: That's very helpful. Just a clarification there. On the -- Bob, you mentioned the FUJIFILM construction would start to -- the phase 1 will start to ramp down in the first half. Is that expected to have any meaningful impact? Or is the award sort of backfilling that?\nBob Pragada: That's on the existing work, Bert. What we announced goes past that. So we're already on site doing phase 1. What I -- so my comment was around phase 1. Phase 2 is now just starting.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, I mean, there's been a lot of questions on sort of the spin-off and sort of the dynamics there, referencing unallocated corporate expense and some of the other things. And I guess, Kevin or Venk, what are some of the dynamics we should be aware of, assuming that the spin-off closes in September, and we're going into the final quarter of the calendar year? What are some things to be aware of just from a perspective on modeling that are going to change? Obviously, not looking for guidance or anything like that, but just some dynamics that maybe are not fully appreciated.\nKevin Berryman: Okay. So yes, a couple of things. One, when we do the Q4 results, the full year results, I should say, since we're closing in or before the fiscal year ends, effectively, we will report on an independent Jacobs for the Q4 results and the full year results and report it on a historical basis as such as well. And all of the business that's included in the perimeter, which will be merged into the Amentum business, that will be basically assets held for sale. So you won't see that information. We have provided you guidance for the full year similar to how we've established it for the full year. So assuming that it closes at the end of the year, all of those numbers that we just quoted would effectively be met. But you're going to actually see a lower number in the results just because some of it is now going to be because it's being put into equity directly as assets held for sale and you're going to be seeing the independent Jacobs. So a lot of clarity we'll be providing to get you an understanding of what that looks like, Bert, when we do report Q4 results, but a lot of moving pieces, but kind of that's a very general view of how you're going to be seeing our financials reported in Q4.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. Yes. Sorry, Kevin, just to add to what Kevin said, in addition to what you said about our business is, obviously, Amentum is going to have their Capital Markets Day in August 13. So we'll have some more color in terms of their business. And then as it relates to ours, we'll provide guidance for all of fiscal 2025 in our November earnings call and then we'll talk about not only the revenue and growth as well as the margin profile. And then later on -- during Investor Day, we'll provide much more color about our long-term growth and operating models.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess most of my questions have been answered. But Bob, just thinking of Jacobs after the Amentum spin, you're going to have a good balance sheet. Your cash flow generation has been fairly impressive. And I'm just thinking about the growth and the margin that you're seeing in PP&S and PA Consulting. So just sort of wondering what your appetite will be for M&A with Jacobs after the spin-off the attractive dynamics that are out there. And then any help you can give us in sort of how we should think about -- I'm just wondering if free cash flow conversion of the RemainCo is a better story than the market anticipates. Thank you.\nBob Pragada: Sure. Maybe I'll take the first one, Jamie, and then Venk can talk about going forward, what free cash flow conversion looks like. But I think initially, we've got a lot of options. And our primary focus in the quarters that followed the separation is execution and performance and really driving that long-term margin growth profile. We like the positioning that we're in, in each of the end markets as well as geographies that we sit in. So it's not like there is an imperative that we need to do M&A in order to catalyze growth. We've got a great growth trajectory organically. And so proving that out, not even proving it out, executing on the plan that we have right now, we've got a lot of confidence in. Past that period, we've got -- you said it yourself, we've got a great balance sheet and we've got a lot of options, and it's a great place to be. So much more to follow on that. On free cash flow, I'll let Venk talk about that.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. And just free cash flow in just a second, but just to reiterate the point about capital allocation, just given what we see ahead of us in terms of the pipeline and the opportunities in front of us, I think from a capital allocation standpoint, we're strong believers in organic growth as the first use of capital. Clearly, from the standpoint of the free cash flow generation and the balance sheet that we have, we do have the ability, number one, we do want to continue to provide shareholders the opportunity to get dividends, but also we do -- we'll be consistent in terms of buying our shares, repurchasing our shares. And then M&A, as Bob mentioned, is also an option. But the next few quarters, almost a singular focus on execution. Now as it comes to free cash flow conversion, Jamie, you rightly pointed out, we've been generating pretty decent free cash flow. We said we'll be at over 100% free cash flow conversion for the remainder of the year. And as you deep dive into the P&PS business, which is a big part of independent Jacobs, you can expect that free cash flow metrics to improve over time. Again, we'll quantify it as we get closer to the date, but we feel pretty good about where we are and where we're going.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSangita Jain: Thank you so much for taking my questions. I guess most of them are answered. So I'm going to limit myself to just one. Are there any discrete deliverables from your side to close the Amentum spin in the second half of September? Or is it just mostly just the paperwork that's taking time? Just wanted to get a sense of that.\nKevin Berryman: All of the regulatory approvals on foreign investment and antitrust, all of those kind of things we've already worked through and all has been approved. The only remaining item is the IRS ruling on our private letter ruling that we're looking for, which confirms a view that -- our view that the transaction is tax-free to our shareholders. That's truly what's driving the timing at this point in time. We've been having great discussions with IRS, more to come, but we would expect to get that approval hopefully and over the next month or so. And effectively, that positions for that second half of September close. We've got a lot of things to do with registration for SEC distribution of shares and so on and so forth. But really, the only thing that we were looking for is the IRS ruling, and we feel confident about it.\nSangita Jain: Got it. Thanks so much.\nBob Pragada: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning guys.\nBob Pragada: Good morning, Chad.\nVenk Nathamuni: Good morning.\nChad Dillard: So my question has to do with the top line growth rate of the P&PS business. Just trying to understand the trajectory of that as we exit 2024 and then going into 2025. So you're starting kind of like a mid-single-digit rate in 2Q. You've got some pretty solid bookings that you brought in this quarter. And so I guess, like will that be enough for the top line to get back into like that, like 69% target range in 2025?\nBob Pragada: Yes. The backlog performance -- the bookings and backlog performance, Chad, has been really, really solid. In fact, the 1.53, we had to go back to see if that was a record in itself. And so we're confident that we're going to be going into 2025 with some really solid growth projections, which we'll be very clear about when we articulate. So that's kind of on the financial and the lagging indicator, the answer is yes. On the leading indicator on the pipeline as well as where we sit in the markets where the pipeline is growing the fastest, water and advanced facilities being highlighted. That also gives us a lot of confidence, too. So short -- a long way of answering your question, the answer is yes.\nChad Dillard: Got you. Okay. And then just on that PP&S segment, again, the operating margins. So I guess at least on a year-to-date basis, you're running somewhere close to like 15%. Any reason like that, why that can't continue? And then one more question for you on the 4Q bookings. I think, Bob, you mentioned that you're pretty optimistic about that pipeline for 4Q. Can you just give a little more detail? And do you think you can actually hit like greater than 1x book-to-bill in the fourth quarter?\nBob Pragada: Yes. So on the -- on our optimism around the P&PS margins and then how that will translate into go-forward margins for the whole company, I think on Slide 11, we did give some guidance on greater than 14.9%. So it probably highlights the optimism that we have on our current reporting structure with regards to that element. And then on Q4, similar to last quarter, Chad, I wouldn't make those comments unless we had already booked work in the first month of the quarter. So I can't quite announce those right now, but you'll see that when we report out on Q4.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. And our final question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.\nBob Pragada: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I wanted to ask People -- hi -- the profit growth that you folks have delivered in People & Places over the past five years has been 8% CAGR over the past over the three years, 11% CAGR. So as you folks think about the organic growth opportunity on a more focused Jacobs, can you just expand on that because the growth has already been really attractive in people in places? And so maybe give us a few threads that you'll expand on the Analyst Day on your expectations to continue to drive that level of growth? Or if you think you can accelerate off of that level of really strong performance that the business has delivered.\nBob Pragada: Yes, Jerry, without giving any kind of quantifiable number on where that number is going, I'll say that this our pipeline, where we're positioning the end markets that we sit in today and in the tailwinds with regards to our bookings performance on that gives us a lot of optimism. And so in November and when we report out on the full year for independent Jacobs as well as going into February and along the way in between, we'll put a lot more clarity as well as quantify what that means. But overall, I think hopefully, you're hearing some real optimism in our voices and in our performance on getting to exceeding the performance that we had for the last five years.\nJerry Revich: That's a high bar. All right. And can I ask in terms of just the moving pieces that you spoke about Bob, around the UK election, have you started to see now the best result? Have you seen an acceleration in activity levels? Or what's the history lesson on UK elections and the lag to when we start to see a booking reacceleration for your business?\nBob Pragada: Yes, I'd say there's been an acceleration in the dialogue, right? And now those translating into those programs that we either paused or in anticipation of being put out to market. I think that's kind of the next phase. So over the course of the next 6 to 12 months, I think we'll see that. Interesting enough, Jerry, the water sector in the UK has not paused at all. And so that continues on. And then with PA, think about this in the UK specifically, as well as globally, PA has about a 50:50 private sector, public sector mix in their business. The public -- the private sector in PA this quarter grew 11% year-on-year. And the public sector was kind of in this election pause. We see that kind of coming out as well, which gives us optimism not only in the Jacobs business, but in the PA business too, moving into FY 2025.\nOperator: And we have one more question from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nLouie DiPalma: Thanks Bob, Kevin, and Venk. What is your forecast for infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. associated with the IIJA and the CHIPS Act? And is that contributing to your strong backlog? I know you highlighted recent wins with water and also a large multimodal transportation win. But what is your general like expectations over the next few years in terms of the IIJA?\nBob Pragada: Sure. Louie, thanks for the question. IIJA, I think these are industry numbers. So 60% appropriated, 30% spent. So yes, there are -- there is work that continues to flow. Right now, I think that the hurdle is 2026. I said it before, that's probably going to continue to go past 2026 as we discussions about a second IIJA, which we'll see where that goes within the congressional floor. But we are -- it is driving that backlog performance and our conversion rate on that as well. I will say this is that on the CHIPS Act -- I'm sorry, one more comment on IIJA. IIJA, the grant money you can see, and that's some of the work that we're seeing that's just in transport, but in water as well. CHIPS Act, those jobs that have received CHIPS Act money, we've been involved with those. Remember, those were pretty much designed and already in the field and then received the funds. Just kind of next wave, we're on the front end of. And so I think that CHIPS Act money will continue to flow and represent a nice tailwind for us.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. And I will turn the conference over to Bob for closing remarks.\nBob Pragada: All right. Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining the earnings call. We look forward to providing further updates and visiting with investors and analysts in the months to come. Exciting times ahead and look forward to staying very open and transparent with the market as we move forward. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Berryman",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q3 results, leading to another solid quarter. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 8. Third quarter gross revenue grew 1% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue also grew 1%. GAAP operating profit was $260 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $73 million of transaction, restructuring and other costs including $62 million associated with the separation transaction. We now expect our total restructuring costs to be approximately $300 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by higher separation transaction costs associated with our anticipated close now targeted during the second half of September 2024. Our adjusted operating margin was again a strong 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.17 per share and included a $0.31 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.49 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.96, marking an 11% increase compared to the previous year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $392 million and was up 11% year-over-year, representing an 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. Finally, consolidated backlog was up 6% year-over-year and the revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.29x with our gross profit and backlog increasing 5.5% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 9. Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year with adjusted operating profit up 12%. Our mix shift mentioned earlier, resulted in higher margins on lower revenue growth. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% was up 95 basis points year-over-year. Our backlog grew by 10% year-over-year, while gross profit in backlog grew 9%. This quarter's critical wins underscore our strength in water, environmental and advanced facilities, reinforcing our leadership position in these key markets. These wins translated into a book-to-bill of 1.53x and a record backlog, as previously mentioned by Bob. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q3 revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, while backlog was up 4%. Excluding the announced contract loss mentioned in the prior quarter, our revenue would have been up slightly year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit was up 1.2% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 35 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%, the highest margin in 10 quarters as the business continues to drive operational improvements and margin-enhancing client-facing projects. Shifting to Divergent Solutions. Q3 saw an 11% year-over-year dip in adjusted net revenue and a 40% year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating profit, driven by a one-time year-to-date government rate adjustment and the space-based ISR program delays that were mentioned in the prior quarter. Despite the strategic shift in funding with the DoD, we continue to see positive momentum in our space-based ISR technology adoption leading to pipeline build and expected future backlog growth. Now let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q3 saw a modest increase in year-over-year revenue. However, PA delivered a strong adjusted operating margin of 21.8%, reflecting a 60 basis point improvement from the previous year. Our margin results this quarter exceeded our expectations and reinforces our confidence in sustaining a strong margin profile as we continue to expect 20% plus margins in Q4. Backlog increased 4% year-over-year, and we expect improved growth as we enter fiscal year 2025. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $61 million in Q3, and we continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model to drive costs down. Finally, I am very excited to welcome Venk to the team. We've been working together closely and I -- and we have made great progress on ensuring a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn the call over to Venk. Well, Look, Steven, I think it's clear that we're going to have a different reporting structure as Venk highlighted once the transaction closes. So the numbers that you will see in the corporate line will start to change, and we're working through all the recurring segments and all that kind of information for the full year reporting. So you may not see exactly the same number going forward, but you will fundamentally on an apples-to-apples basis, that $60 million, we expect will trend down to $50 million over time. And they embedded into a consolidated result for the company and so you may not see it broken out separately. But that's going to help drive towards that 13.8% EBITDA margin that was just asked going forward. So we feel good about it. Some of that cost will have to be targeted after separation because we still have two businesses to run so -- or three, I should say, with PA. And so more to come on that, but we feel confident about the necessary cost reductions that allow us to get to the 13.8% EBITDA margin. Yes. Look, so what we're seeing is we've been talking about the growth profile in People & Places top line wise and being a little bit more muted because effectively we're seeing more consulting science-based technology, technical and consulting work that's happening. In the backlog and the book-to-bill, very strong book-to-bill is some other types of projects, which include lower margin work, which will, at the same time, create accelerated good top line growth. So it will be a little bit of a reduction in mix relative to the consulting piece versus our current levels. And at the end of the day, it's going to be quite positive because we'll still see, I think, incremental margin over time in People & Places because we've proven our ability to do that. And we're going to see some accelerated growth as well associated with some of these larger, I'm going to call it, projects that involve program management and extended dollars being spent, which will include a little bit greater percentage of pass-through revenue, which has more limited margin than the high-value consulting work that we do. Okay. So yes, a couple of things. One, when we do the Q4 results, the full year results, I should say, since we're closing in or before the fiscal year ends, effectively, we will report on an independent Jacobs for the Q4 results and the full year results and report it on a historical basis as such as well. And all of the business that's included in the perimeter, which will be merged into the Amentum business, that will be basically assets held for sale. So you won't see that information. We have provided you guidance for the full year similar to how we've established it for the full year. So assuming that it closes at the end of the year, all of those numbers that we just quoted would effectively be met. But you're going to actually see a lower number in the results just because some of it is now going to be because it's being put into equity directly as assets held for sale and you're going to be seeing the independent Jacobs. So a lot of clarity we'll be providing to get you an understanding of what that looks like, Bert, when we do report Q4 results, but a lot of moving pieces, but kind of that's a very general view of how you're going to be seeing our financials reported in Q4. All of the regulatory approvals on foreign investment and antitrust, all of those kind of things we've already worked through and all has been approved. The only remaining item is the IRS ruling on our private letter ruling that we're looking for, which confirms a view that -- our view that the transaction is tax-free to our shareholders. That's truly what's driving the timing at this point in time. We've been having great discussions with IRS, more to come, but we would expect to get that approval hopefully and over the next month or so. And effectively, that positions for that second half of September close. We've got a lot of things to do with registration for SEC distribution of shares and so on and so forth. But really, the only thing that we were looking for is the IRS ruling, and we feel confident about it."

            "name": "Bob Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Ayan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I'm joined today by my Special Adviser, Kevin Berryman, who acted as Interim CFO into June, and will therefore report our financials. I'm delighted to also welcome our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni, on his first earnings call for Jacobs. Venk joined us in June and will provide details on guidance. Venk brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise from his 30-plus year career, and I am excited to work in partnership with him moving forward. Kevin will continue in his role as special adviser to me to drive a successful conclusion to the separation and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses with the Amentum. I'd like to extend my gratitude for Kevin for our ongoing support. Now moving to Slide 4. We continue to make progress on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value, higher margin portfolio and remain confident in driving margin expansion over the coming years. Turning to Slide 5. I am pleased to report significant progress on the previously announced planned spin-off of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses. An updated Form-10 was publicly filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing made under Amazon Holdco, Inc. includes important business and financial information about the intended merger with Amentum to create a leading publicly traded global government services provider. Amentum will provide additional details during their Capital Markets Day on Tuesday, August 13, 2024. The transaction is now anticipated to be completed in the second half of September 2024. Turning to Slide 6 and Q3. I will now share our third quarter achievements, highlighted by strong backlog growth, consolidated margin expansion and P&PS record backlog and strong adjusted operating margin. This period saw a continuation of a mix shift to higher-margin science-based consulting and advisory services that offers significantly higher returns, contributing to an overall margin expansion, notably led by P&PS and our partnership with PA Consulting. We are seeing an accelerating demand for critical infrastructure, particularly in water, environmental and advanced facilities end markets, which are poised for substantial growth. Consolidated backlog increased 6% year-over-year bolstering confidence that our business will accelerate profitable growth as we strategically shift our portfolio to higher value, higher margin solutions. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA came in at $392 million, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period last year and representing 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. From a cash perspective, we started the second half of the year by delivering very strong operating cash flow of $483 million and free cash flow of $445 million. We continue to expect exceeding 100% reported free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024, underscoring the power of our business model. Turning to Slide 7. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another -- of solid top line growth, along with strong adjusted operating margins of 15.3% and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% year-on-year. We ended Q3 with a strong book-to-bill of 1.53x and record backlog. Adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS -- solid P&PS organic revenue growth for Q4 fiscal year 2024. I'm particularly pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins in core sectors such as water, environmental and advanced facilities, a testament to our robust market positioning, deep domain expertise and long-term trusted client relationships. We achieved double-digit growth in our water and environmental markets with two thirds of our water-related business focused in on high-value science-based consulting and advisory services, driven by aging infrastructure and emerging PFAS regulations. Water continues to be a foundational element of our portfolio, exemplified by key wins across various geographies, reinforcing our global leadership in the sector. Europe, particularly the UK, has shown resilience, posting a robust quarter in water-related awards. In Asia, we were appointed by PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency to engineer and program manage the new Kranji Water Reclamation Plant designed to enhance Northern Singapore's water treatment capacity by 120 million imperial gallons per day. Additionally, our partnership with Onondaga County, the Syracuse metropolitan area in Central New York, which began in 2008, continues as they've chosen us to provide program management services for their efforts in controlling increased combined sewer outflow and utilizes our Digital OneWater solutions. This expansion will be critical in remediating aging water infrastructure and supporting industrial growth in the geography. We're excited by the continued momentum in pipeline build in our advanced facilities portfolio, predominantly driven by life sciences, semiconductor manufacturing and AI chip driven data center expansion. Specifically in life sciences, we continue to see robust growth with our pipeline and revenue growing double digits year-over-year. Approximately two thirds of our life sciences related business is concentrated in high-value science-based consulting and advisory services. We were selected by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies to support the $1.2 billion expansion of their large-scale biologics facility -- biologics manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina, providing engineering, procurement and program management services with the first phase of construction expected to complete in 2025. We continue to see a growing pipeline in transportation and energy and power supported by ongoing government stimulus. As an example, in transportation, we were selected to provide program management services for Broward County Transportation Department's first-ever public transit expansion. This $4.4 billion 30-year initiative will transform the county's transportation infrastructure into a multimodal transit system with a new light rail connecting Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport to Port Everglades. Additionally, the quarter was highlighted by several key wins in the energy and sustainability space as demonstrated by our appointment as program manager for the ARCHES Hydrogen Consortium and master service agreement with Shell Energy in Australia. PA Consulting delivered an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 21.8% with robust execution and cost discipline. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator in our science-based consulting and advisory services. Together with PA, we were selected in the Hertfordshire County, UK to enhance the public highways network in the county with services valued at approximately $22 million annually. This collaboration focuses on sustainability and aims to deliver long-term value over an initial five-year period with potential extensions up to 14 years. In Divergent Solutions, we are encouraged by the ongoing demand for our digitally enabled infrastructure solutions that will remain with independent Jacobs post close. A testament to our capabilities is our recent selection by the City of Omaha to develop a data analytics and AI-enabled support system for its wastewater network, utilizing Jacobs Digital OneWater Solutions, Aqua DNA. CMS delivered 35 basis points of margin expansion, the highest in 10 quarters and has a strong pipeline. Additionally, we're experiencing encouraging trends that support long-term growth as we approach the merger with Amentum. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to win higher value, higher-margin solutions and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Venk. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market, and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Good morning, Mike. Sure. Mike, maybe I'll address both. I'd say, yes, the gross profit and backlog is definitely being positively affected by two elements: one, our service mix; and second, the end market sector mix. And so on the service mix, I mentioned a couple of times, we are really seeing a fundamental shift in our profile with regards to higher-end science-based consulting and advisory services. And that's not only showing up in our results from a burn profile but also in the backlog. The profile of the backlog is right now at a point in time, heavily weighted towards water as well as in advanced facilities, predominantly life sciences. And those two have a higher margin profile as well, so both are having a positive effect on that. With regards to FY 2025, we were looking forward to potentially another strong Q4 backlog performance, booking and backlog performance leading to confidence in our revenue growth in FY 2025. So, definitely some nice tailwinds there. Hi, good morning, Andy. Yes. Go ahead, Venk. Yes. So maybe the first one with regards to confidence going into FY 2025, Andy. There was a reason why we put the plus. Clearly, some moving parts right now with regards to the separation. So timing was another element that we want to consider. Performance has been solid. So I would just -- I'd characterize it as some tailwinds that we've got going into FY 2025, and we'll be really clear about that as we move into -- in the next phase, but confidence overall. Andy, remind me again the second half of the question? Yes. Sorry about that. So yes, good visibility there. During the quarter, we -- strong tailwinds in water and advanced facilities in the areas where there was a little bit of maybe some slight -- not decay, but pause, I'd say, in the UK with regards to transport and the election and then the reprioritization of some shifts in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi. Those haven't gone away. And now with the election in the UK as well as some clarity on programs moving forward in Saudi, those also service some positive tailwinds on a mix standpoint going into FY 2025. Yes. I think it's early, Steve. We're going to go through all of that in some details, but we're really excited about the tailwinds that we see for FY 2025, specifically in all subsectors of the infrastructure market and facilities, but we remain very positive. Yes. A couple of comments. Let me start kind of with the U.S. and then work my way around. I'd say in the U.S., the flow of bid activity and pipeline across infrastructure and advanced facility, that hasn't slowed. I'd say the burn rate of some of our U.S. transport work has been a little slower from a burn standpoint, but the level of opportunities have been there. In water, I'd say globally, we have seen some real positive momentum both on bookings as well as burn and that's across all geographies. U.S., Europe to include the UK, Middle East and our Asia Pac and ANZ area. So water has been in that realm as well as advanced facilities really driven by life sciences. So I'd say that just the two areas that we saw as a part of the election in the UK pause was transport. Water kept going in the UK and then the reprioritization in Saudi with regards to some of the event-driven cities oriented work moving more towards the time-based work like the Expo or the airport or infrastructure that's going to be needed with a time element to that in 2026 leading to the Expo and the FIFA World Cup. So these are things that we're continuing to add optimism as we move into Q4 and beyond. Sure. So as far as again what's driving it, clearly, the aging infrastructure is a big piece. The other piece is around combined sewer overflows and what's happening with regards to climate and some of the natural disasters that we're seeing. So I'd say that's accelerating what's going on as well. In the drinking water component, we are seeing an increase in PFAS -- in addressing the PFAS regulations, specifically in the U.S., but also in Germany and in other locations, too. So that's all kind of driving that. Just to quantify it, Sabahat, our pipeline in the water sector is up nearly 2x as it pertains to this time last year. And we are winning a majority of the work that we're going after, hence, the real attention and focus on the growth. Andy, maybe just -- I'll let Kevin kind of clarify the nuances within the backlog, and then I'll talk about kind of the profile as it pertains to the various end markets and we can talk about that profile. Yes. And Andy, maybe I'll just extend on that last thought that Kevin had. So then if you break that, you cited the consolidated numbers on the 6% and the 5.5% in gross profit. If you then translate that into P&PS, which relates to the last comment that Kevin made, that looks like more like 10% on the top line and 9% on gross profit. So you can kind of see the dynamic leaning towards P&PS is growing at a much higher rate. Yes, absolutely. So we really looked at in a consolidated company, what type of corporate needs are going to be needed on more of a homogenous corporate needs are a lot more synchronized across the world. So those movements to global business centers and real streamlining of process protocols and systematic enhancements. Those have been taking place in real time. From a business standpoint, we've already started to transition into optimizing on a lot of our cross-cutting capabilities, program management, digital enablement and other strong sales, market-leading sales functions that will cut across the entirety of the company. So the geographic nuance client-facing entities with cross-cutting capabilities, that structure, it's almost like being in -- with the being the Olympic time right now, it's already in that zone where we're handing off the baton in that section, we're already off and running. Hi, Bert. Good morning. Sure. So specifically on semis, Bert, we've been working on this for a while. So clearly, we do, do a lot of work for Intel, and that work is fundamentally on that CapEx program that they highlighted three or four years ago. We had substantially worked our way through that. And so the news that's come out has got a minimal effect on us. The diversification of our services that we perform for Intel, those kind of ongoing sustaining capital work that we do around tool installs and retrofits and layout dependent type work, that will continue. So -- but the good news is that our diversification into memory customers as well as other logic customers that are doing work in the U.S. and in Europe, that's continued, and we'll have, hopefully, some good news to share next quarter on that as well as some of the geographic expansion that's going on in places like India. And so we have some really positive momentum going on, on that front. So overall we're still bullish on the sector, and we'll continue to accelerate growth. And then on life sciences, yes, that's really going well right now. And it's probably a lot of discussion around GLP-1. But what we're seeing is Alzheimer's and oncology drugs still making a really big play. So the two big players that are in the GLP-1 sector, that is a big part of our work, but the new awards that are coming through, whether they be in the contract manufacturing space or in these other players that are -- have got a really nice pipeline of drugs coming into oncology as well as in Alzheimer's. Those are -- that's really driving that optimism too. That's on the existing work, Bert. What we announced goes past that. So we're already on site doing phase 1. What I -- so my comment was around phase 1. Phase 2 is now just starting. Sure. Maybe I'll take the first one, Jamie, and then Venk can talk about going forward, what free cash flow conversion looks like. But I think initially, we've got a lot of options. And our primary focus in the quarters that followed the separation is execution and performance and really driving that long-term margin growth profile. We like the positioning that we're in, in each of the end markets as well as geographies that we sit in. So it's not like there is an imperative that we need to do M&A in order to catalyze growth. We've got a great growth trajectory organically. And so proving that out, not even proving it out, executing on the plan that we have right now, we've got a lot of confidence in. Past that period, we've got -- you said it yourself, we've got a great balance sheet and we've got a lot of options, and it's a great place to be. So much more to follow on that. On free cash flow, I'll let Venk talk about that. Thank you. Good morning, Chad. Yes. The backlog performance -- the bookings and backlog performance, Chad, has been really, really solid. In fact, the 1.53, we had to go back to see if that was a record in itself. And so we're confident that we're going to be going into 2025 with some really solid growth projections, which we'll be very clear about when we articulate. So that's kind of on the financial and the lagging indicator, the answer is yes. On the leading indicator on the pipeline as well as where we sit in the markets where the pipeline is growing the fastest, water and advanced facilities being highlighted. That also gives us a lot of confidence, too. So short -- a long way of answering your question, the answer is yes. Yes. So on the -- on our optimism around the P&PS margins and then how that will translate into go-forward margins for the whole company, I think on Slide 11, we did give some guidance on greater than 14.9%. So it probably highlights the optimism that we have on our current reporting structure with regards to that element. And then on Q4, similar to last quarter, Chad, I wouldn't make those comments unless we had already booked work in the first month of the quarter. So I can't quite announce those right now, but you'll see that when we report out on Q4. Hi, Jerry. Yes, Jerry, without giving any kind of quantifiable number on where that number is going, I'll say that this our pipeline, where we're positioning the end markets that we sit in today and in the tailwinds with regards to our bookings performance on that gives us a lot of optimism. And so in November and when we report out on the full year for independent Jacobs as well as going into February and along the way in between, we'll put a lot more clarity as well as quantify what that means. But overall, I think hopefully, you're hearing some real optimism in our voices and in our performance on getting to exceeding the performance that we had for the last five years. Yes, I'd say there's been an acceleration in the dialogue, right? And now those translating into those programs that we either paused or in anticipation of being put out to market. I think that's kind of the next phase. So over the course of the next 6 to 12 months, I think we'll see that. Interesting enough, Jerry, the water sector in the UK has not paused at all. And so that continues on. And then with PA, think about this in the UK specifically, as well as globally, PA has about a 50:50 private sector, public sector mix in their business. The public -- the private sector in PA this quarter grew 11% year-on-year. And the public sector was kind of in this election pause. We see that kind of coming out as well, which gives us optimism not only in the Jacobs business, but in the PA business too, moving into FY 2025. Sure. Louie, thanks for the question. IIJA, I think these are industry numbers. So 60% appropriated, 30% spent. So yes, there are -- there is work that continues to flow. Right now, I think that the hurdle is 2026. I said it before, that's probably going to continue to go past 2026 as we discussions about a second IIJA, which we'll see where that goes within the congressional floor. But we are -- it is driving that backlog performance and our conversion rate on that as well. I will say this is that on the CHIPS Act -- I'm sorry, one more comment on IIJA. IIJA, the grant money you can see, and that's some of the work that we're seeing that's just in transport, but in water as well. CHIPS Act, those jobs that have received CHIPS Act money, we've been involved with those. Remember, those were pretty much designed and already in the field and then received the funds. Just kind of next wave, we're on the front end of. And so I think that CHIPS Act money will continue to flow and represent a nice tailwind for us. All right. Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining the earnings call. We look forward to providing further updates and visiting with investors and analysts in the months to come. Exciting times ahead and look forward to staying very open and transparent with the market as we move forward. Thank you."

            "name": "Venk Nathamuni",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Let me begin by saying I'm very excited to be part of the Jacobs team and a special thanks to Kevin for his partnership and support. I'll now provide a quick overview of our balance sheet and cash flow metrics, followed by consolidated full year guidance. Turning to Slide 10. We posted a strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. We generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $445 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow conversion was well above 100%, leading to a full year expectation of greater than 100%. Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $151 million of shares during the quarter, which was up $55 million compared to Q2, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We have $528 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we've stated before, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion and our Q3 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.1x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt remaining current in the fiscal year. We have ample options, refinancing as well as using proceeds from the expected separation transaction for repaying the current amounts. As of the end of Q3, approximately 37% of our debt was tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. On the dividend front, we remain committed to growing our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29 and 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on August 2023. Now turning to Slide 11. Given the solid execution thus far, we're narrowing our consolidated adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $7.85 to $8.05, representing 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of the $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion range. This guidance incorporates Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.96 and approximately 27% adjusted effective tax rate for the remainder of this fiscal year. Additionally, this represents 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year-ago period. Our expectation is that the ongoing positive momentum in our business will lead to increased revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 compared to our current levels. Once we close the separation transaction, we anticipate an immediate shift in our company's growth profile, positioning us solidly for higher growth and higher margins. As Bob mentioned earlier, the anticipated separation transaction close date is now in the second half of September 2024. As a result, we expect Q3 to be the last quarter in which the results of the separated businesses will be included in our continuing operations. Beginning next quarter, we expect our results for our continuing operations to reflect the new independent Jacobs. Historical results for independent Jacobs will be available following the close of the transaction. And lastly, we're excited to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day for independent Jacobs on February 18, 2025, in Miami, Florida. We look forward to sharing our long-term strategy as well as our financial target model with the investor community during this event. Additional details will be forthcoming, and we look forward to your participation. And with that, now I'll turn the call back to Bob. Good morning. Yes. Andy, yes, thanks for the question. So I'd say a few moving parts as it relates to the EBITDA performance. So obviously, from the standpoint of EPS, we came in kind of the midpoint of the range as we guided to. Now as far as the EBITDA is concerned, we did allude to the fact that there were a couple of segments that were weaker than we expected. One was obviously the CMS, the Cytec loss that was announced in the prior quarter and then some of the DVS delays that Bob alluded to in his earnings script. But I would say at a higher level, when you look at the difference between the EBITDA performance and the EPS performance, clearly, we had a little bit of a tax benefit that helped us on the EPS front. And then obviously, as you also know, we reported a pretty significant stock buyback so that reduced the share count as well. So I'd say the difference between the EBITDA and EPS is primarily due to those two items. But what I would also point to is that if you look at the P&PS backlog, we feel pretty good about where our profile of that business is heading towards, both from a revenue growth standpoint as well as the margin standpoint. And Andy, if I could, I would say just in terms of just what we see ahead clearly, from a Q4 booking standpoint, there's still some good confidence about the strength of those bookings. But in terms of specifics, we'll obviously provide you fiscal 2025 guidance in the next earnings call. And then we look forward to providing a much more long-term guidance, both in terms of the revenue growth as well as our profitability profile when we have the Investor Day in February. Thank you for your questions. Good morning. And Bert, if I could, just having most recently come from the semiconductor sector, we do see this as a secular trend in terms of where the manufacturing footprint is and across different realms of semiconductors and logic and memory, as Bob alluded to, and there's also a geographical shift that's happening. So as we look at our portfolio, we have good confidence that we are pretty well diversified. And then just the scope of the opportunities in front of us are still pretty good. Now obviously, any given quarter, it depends on what happens to the market. But I think if you look at it from a secular standpoint, we feel pretty good about our semiconductor footprint. Yes. Yes. Sorry, Kevin, just to add to what Kevin said, in addition to what you said about our business is, obviously, Amentum is going to have their Capital Markets Day in August 13. So we'll have some more color in terms of their business. And then as it relates to ours, we'll provide guidance for all of fiscal 2025 in our November earnings call and then we'll talk about not only the revenue and growth as well as the margin profile. And then later on -- during Investor Day, we'll provide much more color about our long-term growth and operating models. Yes. And just free cash flow in just a second, but just to reiterate the point about capital allocation, just given what we see ahead of us in terms of the pipeline and the opportunities in front of us, I think from a capital allocation standpoint, we're strong believers in organic growth as the first use of capital. Clearly, from the standpoint of the free cash flow generation and the balance sheet that we have, we do have the ability, number one, we do want to continue to provide shareholders the opportunity to get dividends, but also we do -- we'll be consistent in terms of buying our shares, repurchasing our shares. And then M&A, as Bob mentioned, is also an option. But the next few quarters, almost a singular focus on execution. Now as it comes to free cash flow conversion, Jamie, you rightly pointed out, we've been generating pretty decent free cash flow. We said we'll be at over 100% free cash flow conversion for the remainder of the year. And as you deep dive into the P&PS business, which is a big part of independent Jacobs, you can expect that free cash flow metrics to improve over time. Again, we'll quantify it as we get closer to the date, but we feel pretty good about where we are and where we're going. Good morning."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Engineering Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ayan Banerjee, Senior Vice President, Finance, Treasury, Investor Relations, Corporate Development. Ayan, you may begin your conference.\nAyan Banerjee: Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures, and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and Interim CFO, Kevin Berryman. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities, then summarizing highlights from our second quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Ayan. Good day everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I want to welcome Kevin Berryman, previously our President and Chief Financial Officer back, following his appointment as interim CFO. Kevin brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role, having served as our CFO for over nine years. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in navigating significant transformations and driving growth across our organization and most recently, has demonstrated exceptional leadership in overseeing the ongoing separation of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence businesses as well as its planned strategic merger with Amentum. As we move forward, we have initiated to search for a permanent CFO with the assistance of an executive search firm. We are working towards concluding this search expeditiously and are grateful that Kevin has agreed to remain at Jacobs through the close of the separation transaction to provide overlap with our next CFO and ensure a smooth transition. Now, moving to Slide 4. I want to emphasize our solid progress on the cost optimization plan. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure, expanding margins, and accelerating profitable growth across our lines of business. Our strategic shift towards a less complex, higher value, and higher margin portfolio remains on track. We are actively identifying opportunities to streamline our operating model and enhance efficiency, while continuing to deliver world-class value-added scientific-based, digitally-enabled solutions to create a more connected and sustainable world. We have made significant progress on our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence separation planning. We're pleased to report that we have now achieved a significant milestone by receiving all approvals and clearances under competition and foreign direct investment laws that are conditioned to the separation transaction. We are steadily advancing our Form 10 filing targeted for early summer. We expect to fulfill the remaining closing conditions and complete the transaction in the second half of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Turning to Slide 5 and Q2. I'm pleased to report solid second quarter consolidated revenue, driven by 5% growth and 3% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year and gross margin in backlog increased approximately 50 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our business will continue to deliver profitable growth. Turning to Slide 6. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another quarter of solid top line growth as we continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth. As demonstrated by P&PS, record adjusted operating margin of 15.3% and strong adjusted operating profit growth of 15.3% year-on-year. We continue to drive organic revenue growth up 7.5% and adjusted up 5.6% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic revenue growth of mid to high single-digits in FY 2024. During the quarter, we have delivered several marquee wins across multiple core market sectors. In transportation, we have been selected as Amtrak's delivery partner for the $6 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, America's busiest passenger railroad, one of the largest national transportation and infrastructure investments and the most significant IIJA Award to-date. The team will provide program and construction management services from contract initiation through service commissioning for two high-capacity tunnel tubes for electrified passenger trains, improving rail systems and enhancing accessibility to transform this 10-mile section of the Northeast Corridor. PA Consulting is an integral part of our program management team, demonstrating their emerging presence in transport in the U.S. and the power of our collaborative partnership. In Aviation, we continue our long-term relationship with Los Angeles World Airports to provide program management services at Los Angeles International Airport. Infrastructure improvements at LAX will enhance the city's preparedness for upcoming sporting events, including the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. Water remains a critical growth catalyst with several strategic wins across our key geographies, further bolstering our position in the sector, as evidenced by our appointment by Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer Department to design upgrades for the county's three wastewater treatment plants, benefiting nearly 2.4 million residents and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Jacobs will incorporate Intelligent O&M, a digital one water solution from its suite of digital products to provide our confident decision-making and to achieve greater efficiencies, reducing wastewater treatment costs, and optimizing operational labor. Additionally, we were selected by United Utilities, one of the U.K.'s largest listed water companies to its strategic solutions team supporting program optimization for major capital works through the AMP8 and AMP9 cycles, which cover the period from 2025 to 2035. Furthermore, we were selected by Water Corporation, the largest water utility in Western Australia to design, build, operate, and maintain the Alkimos Seawater Desalinization Plant in Perth, Australia. The project, part of an alliance with Water Corporation and ACCIONA is expected to ultimately produce 26 billion gallons of drinking water. In recent weeks, significant regulatory steps have been taken in the environmental sector. The U.S. EPA set maximum contaminant levels for five PFAS compounds. The first major U.S. drinking water legislation in 20 years and classified two PFAS compounds as hazardous under the Superfund program, expanding our potential for environmental management and compliance services. Internationally, the EU has also progressed, banning certain PFAS compounds and moving forward with risk evaluations. These developments are expected to increase demand for our consulting, engineering, and remediation services. We've been working with and advising our clients about how these anticipated regulations will impact them since discussions began some years ago. Now, that the regulations are finalized, we're having robust conversations with our clients about their options to navigate this next chapter. PA Consultant is working with companies that have PFAS materials in their products and advising on how to remove them from their products and supply chains as well as assessing how to create alternative materials. With our expertise, strong market presence, and leading position as demonstrated by our ongoing work with the Department of Defense, U.K. government, and Australian Aviation authorities, Jacobs is ready to lead in this evolving space. In Life Sciences, our overall pipeline continues to grow at double-digit rates year-over-year, driven by long-term relationships. There are significant opportunities in the pipeline and we are well-positioned for continued growth. In CMS, Q2 revenue was up 3% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit increased 10% with approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. The CMS team is executing well, and we continue to see several positive trends for long-term growth as the team prepares for the merger with Amentum. PA Consulting delivered among an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 20.5% with solid execution and cost discipline. We continue to expect the remaining quarters in FY 2024 to exceed 20% adjusted operating margin. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator for us with some nice wins in the quarter, including the previously mentioned Frederick Douglass Tunnel and an appointment to the HM Revenue & Customs multibillion-pound framework in the U.K., intended to upgrade software systems across the government agency. Divergent Solutions delivered a solid adjusted operating margin performance at approximately 10% and adjusted operating profit growth, which would have been approximately 13% excluding a large license sale to Palantir in the comparison period. Our suite of digital products and platforms are elevating the value we can provide to our clients globally. In summary, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our core market sectors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\nKevin Berryman: Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q2 results, leading to another strong quarter. We are steadfast in our commitment to providing high-value solutions with improved margins, supported by our continued emphasis on operational excellence and execution. So, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. Second quarter gross revenue grew 5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 3%. GAAP operating profit was $281 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $58 million of transaction, restructuring, and other costs, including $47 million associated with the separation transaction. We still expect our total restructuring cost to be approximately $275 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by the separation transaction. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.28 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.34 from transaction, restructuring, and other related costs, all of which were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.91, marking a 7% decrease compared to the previous year. When adjusting for last year's second quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.32, our current non-GAAP EPS represents an approximately 10% year-over-year increase. Looking forward, we anticipate maintaining an annual effective tax rate of 22% for the full fiscal year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $393 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing a strong 11.3% adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 2% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.96 times with our gross profit and backlog increasing 4% year-over-year. Excluding a one-time change in government funding strategy with regard to Space ISR programs, which I'll describe in more detail during my segment comments, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been approximately 1.06 times, with significant strength in pipeline growth and expected large wins in Q3 and Q4. Regarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8. We are particularly pleased with our performance in People & Places Solutions. Q2 adjusted net revenue was up 5.6% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit growth was strong at 15.3%. Reflecting our commitment to higher end profitable growth, the segment saw a record adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business. Our backlog has grown by 2% year-over-year and we've seen a 7% increase in the gross profit in our backlog. This improvement reflects our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of our bids and project wins as we expect some critical large wins to occur in Q3. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q2 revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year with backlog up 3.9%. Our adjusted operating profit was up 10.3% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year as the business continued to find avenues of operational improvements. While a recent program loss will put some short-term pressure on the second half, our recent successes in shorter-cycle awards is expected to help mitigate the impact. Our work remains mission-critical, allowing the business to show long-term resilience against shifts in government funding and program adjustments. Let's now focus on Divergent Solutions. During Q2, we observed an 11% year-over-year decrease in adjusted net revenue and 24% decrease year-over-year in adjusted operating profit. Excluding a one-time Palantir license in the previous period, adjusted operating profit would have been up 13% year-over-year. While backlog was negatively impacted by a change in funding strategy with the DoD on space-based ISR programs, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in near-term sales, which we believe will contribute to our ongoing success. Now, let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q2 saw a slight decline of 2% in year-over-year revenue, driven by a continued challenging macro environment in the consulting industry and a solid year ago comparable. However, cost and execution discipline helped deliver a strong adjusted operating margin of 20.5%, a 270 basis point increase from the previous sequential quarter. As we emphasized during our last earnings call, our industry position is uniquely differentiated and our work is both purposeful and critical. As a result, PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong adjusted operating profit margins, targeting above 20% for the second half of the year. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q2. We continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model and driving costs down. We expect this line item post separation to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually. Turning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. After delivering a strong free cash flow in Q1, our quarterly free cash flow was negative $71 million in Q2 as working capital increased the planned levels from the exceptional performance in Q1. Despite this impact in the second quarter, our reported free cash flow conversion for the first half of the year has remained at approximately 100%. And as a result, we are well-positioned to deliver on our forecast, maintaining 100% reported as well as adjusted free cash flow conversion for the full year. Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $95 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We still have $679 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders, while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and gross debt of $3 billion. Our Q2 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.3 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength of the balance sheet, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt having become current in Q2. We have ample options: refinancing, using proceeds from our upcoming separation transaction, and/or accessing our revolver. As of the end of Q2, approximately 37% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.2%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and year-to-date free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29, an 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on June 21st. Bob, back over to you.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 10. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives. As a result, we are narrowing the range for fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion, and adjusted EPS to $7.80 to $8.10, representing a 9% and 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.91 and a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, this represents a 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year ago period. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning everyone.\nRobert Pragada: Hi, good morning Andy.\nKevin Berryman: Good morning Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Bob or Kevin, can you give us more color into what's going on with Jacobs' backlog and how to think about it going forward? I know that you said backlog in People & Places is up about 2% year-over-year, but can you elaborate a bit more on the larger prospects you're talking about for Q3? Do you see a nice acceleration in backlog growth in the second half in People & Places? And then maybe just a change in the space-based ISR impacting Divergent, that business is going with CMS, the deal or correct, but could you give us some more color on what happened there?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with P&PS and then Kevin can talk about kind of the entirety. So, in P&PS, Andy, a couple of things. One is timing. We've got -- let me first off by saying that as a gross number, the P&PS backlog represents a record backlog for the segment since we formed it nearly five years ago. So, kind of point one there. As far as the growth, we've kind of got tied a little bit into some timing of some of the larger programs that drive the backlog. Our book-to-bill is still over 1, and in the second half with expected awards, some of which we've already received in the first month of the quarter, we're going to see a real acceleration in the backlog in P&PS. Kevin, you want to talk about the overall as well as Divergent?\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, I think the dynamics associated with Divergent and you're right, that part of the business is going to be part of the separation, so it's in the parameter of the separation transaction, Andy. And look, there was a change in funding strategy, whereby the technology and associated projects that we have are still considered viable and probably the best technologies to be utilizing going forward, but because of deciding how they were going to be funding it, DoD is handing over that responsibility to the intelligence community. So, while long-term, we have a reduction -- well, short-term, we have a reduction in our backlog because the DoD is handing that over, we're starting to, right now, see immediate build back up in some of those projects being now embedded into the intelligence community. While it represents certainly a delay in some of the burn of that project, our expectation is longer term, that DVS will start to see that same backlog come back into their kind of backlog over the course of the next year-plus, and consequently, we'll have to build up the burn once again. And so if you think about those two dynamics, I think those are kind of short-term dynamics when you include People & Places. And when you see the outlook for the rest of the year, we're feeling pretty good about our backlog growth and book-to-bill over the balance of the year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then just People & Places margins, obviously very good performance. I know you've been sort of allocating corporate costs. Maybe how much did you end up allocating to the segment? And can you talk about whether you're actually in a better trajectory than you guided when you talked about it being better than the 14.6 that you did last year in People & Places?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So, on the first part, that allocation hasn't changed since we talked about it last quarter, so that's remained consistent. And we're not going to change that philosophy. Really, this quarter, the mix that we saw specifically around Water and Life Sciences, when we think about it, those are two segments, Andy, that are growing at double-digit rates. And from a pipeline standpoint, I mean, both are nearly -- the pipelines are doubling on a year-on-year basis. So, that mix of higher-margin work that's coming in is really driving that growth.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks guys. Kevin, welcome back even though that you really didn't leave. Thanks.\nKevin Berryman: Thanks Andy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Judah Aronovitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJudah Aronovitz: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Calling in for Steve Fisher. First question is, what has changed in the background in the second half that drove your guidance change?\nRobert Pragada: Can you say that again? I'm sorry.\nKevin Berryman: Sorry, didn't follow the question.\nJudah Aronovitz: Yes, sorry. I guess what's changed in the background that drove your guidance change? Like anything going on in the second half that is maybe different than your prior expectations?\nKevin Berryman: No. Look, I think at the end of the day, we feel as if we're being prudent in our guidance, and it still represents a 13% year-over-year kind of increase in EPS. So, I think at the end, we're sitting here saying, that's a good ending result. We're being prudent in the establishment of that. And of course, it's offsetting some of the things that we know are already in our numbers, the inventory write-offs that we had in the first quarter. So, I think it's quite actually a positive.\nJudah Aronovitz: Okay, that's helpful. And my second question is about project selectivity. How is that playing out in your business and what kind of projects are you saying no to, and how often are you saying no? thank you.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Project selectivity is -- we've always had that. And that has become kind of a primary focus for us as the opportunities have increased. Talk a little bit about Water and Life Sciences, in our Transportation business right now, our win rates have been the highest, you could say, in the highest in the market. And they've been the highest that we've experienced, and a lot of that comes from because it's subjective evaluation from what we put our effort and our money behind on trending. Probably the biggest component of that is around long-term client relationships. We're not out looking for work. We've been with our clients for decades. And if you think about 3,700 clients around the world and over the course of the last 20 years, that's a 2% client turnover. And so when we're with a client, we're there for the long-term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning Bob and Kevin, and welcome back as well.\nRobert Pragada: Hi Mike.\nKevin Berryman: Thanks Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Bob, you mentioned in your prepared remarks life science and an expanded pipeline. And maybe generally in Life Science, semi data centers, some of the more facilities work, the conversion timing and level relative to those businesses? I certainly haven't a diversity help. So maybe you can share a little bit about how that plays through and maybe through the second half, which might incorporate some of those projects you're talking about and still the momentum from the client work that you're seeing into 2025.\nRobert Pragada: Sure. So maybe I'll start with in sciences and then talk about semi kind of the electronics world right now. I mentioned this before, Mike, within our life sciences world, you've heard a lot about GLP-1 and everything is going around the obesity drug. If you look at the two biggest ones that are in that space, our work that we do for them represents nearly over 50% of the capital that they put in place. So that work continues to be a big driver. But what's also happening is two other dynamics. One is around oncology. There are quite a few advances that are happening around oncology. And so timing on those was maybe a little slower than we wanted over the course of the last few quarters. But going into the second half, those jobs are right in front of us, and we're well positioned for those. The last dynamic around Life Sciences is just sheer capacity. Here, the CEOs of life sciences companies and biotech companies talk about capacity as the biggest choke point. The contract manufacturing world is on the rise as well. So we'll have some good news here in the second half and actually in Q3 around what's going on in that contract manufacturing space. Semiconductor, a lot of stuff in the news right now about the ubiquitous world of chip manufacturing and how AI is driving not just chip manufacturing but also data centers. We're seeing that. The chips money has now been delivered to the market, and some of the largest players have benefited from that. So we're seeing projects that we've already been involved with talk about Phase 2 of those. And so we'll have more to say as those become public in the second half, but it's really the entirety of the ecosystem of the chip manufacturing and semiconductor world. Starting from the R&D facility through manufacturing and now you'll hear a lot more about test and assembly and those test and assembly facilities coming to the US. So, we're excited about what's going on. And then in data centers, the power usage of these are creating opportunities for us with regards to power and cooling, the water requirements on now what could be 1 gigawatt data center. So, really, really positive story there.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, Bob. And my follow-up is maybe for either one on PA. How do you see the macro in the second half of the year and certainly seems like internal opportunities are helping drive a bit more on the margin? And is there an opportunity to get some more maybe profit growth along with some net revenue growth into 2025 as you're looking at it today?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Maybe I'll make a couple of comments on the opportunities and on backlog, and then Kevin can talk about the margins. What gets embedded in is the PA backlog was actually up 8% year-over-year. And so we're starting to see that momentum of those opportunities and those collaborative opportunities come through. So that's exciting news there. And a lot around the U.K. macro has been driving the business with at least hopefully some clarity that there'll be an election in the U.K. in the second half of the year, we're already starting to see the pipeline grow in the sales performance in the last month of the quarter kind of drove the business. So, the momentum is there. And then given we're talking about the margin.\nKevin Berryman: Yes. Look, I think the team has done a really good job, Mike, relative to rightsizing the organization, given some of the challenges in the overall consulting industry, which obviously is impacting PA to a certain extent. But they're very well positioned, especially in the U.K. market. And so we're feeling good about their ability to be delivering that 20% plus margin in the back half of the year. And so longer term, I think that, that translates into numbers going on from there as well. And look, I think as we enter the end of the calendar year, we do have the dynamic of the U.K. election. So, we're going to have to watch that carefully to see what impacts are -- but what we have right now is pretty clear visibility on our Q3 and Q4 reported numbers in terms of the health of the PA business, not substantial growth, but certainly good solid execution in the balance of the fiscal year for us.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. One on people in places, the margins implied in the back half of the year, Kevin, I think, are down relative to where we were in the second quarter. I know you spoke to mix. But with backlog -- with gross margins and backlog being up, I'm just wondering what's going on there? Or is there just some level of conservatism in your margin guidance? And then my second question, just on the large awards that you're expecting in the back half of the year. I'm assuming that you don't need any of these awards to make your guide for 2024. So I guess I'll start with those. Thank you.\nKevin Berryman: Well, let me start on the first one. Look, I think 15.3% that we saw people in place is a record, is at a high level. And consequently, I don't think we can assume that every quarter is going to be 15.3% just because of the factors associated with cost of mix and what actually hit us during a particular quarter. I will say that as we think about our margin profile, we're feeling better about it today than we felt last quarter. So I can characterize it from that perspective. It doesn't mean we're going to hit 15.3% in Q3 and Q4, but I think we're going to end the year at numbers that are going to be pretty darn attractive.\nRobert Pragada: And then on the awards, Jamie, those are -- when I say are they part of the guide or not part of the guide, our guide incorporates the probability waiting for the award. But we're feeling optimistic about not just the award anticipated awards, but the pipeline. The pipeline is looking extremely robust in PPS.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSangita Jain: Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask about Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom seems to be scaling back on parts of the NEOM project. So I just wanted to hear what you guys are hearing and what your exposure there might look like?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. So maybe I'll just talk about broadly Saudi and then specifically on NEOM. Broadly, Saudi, the pipeline of work continues. And it's -- for us, it's a diverse pipeline. We don't index towards a specific type of offering. We've got value-added services that we provide to the entire life cycle of these programs. And if you look at the pipeline, the infrastructure component of it, the transportation, whether it be in aviation or in rail as well as the water opportunities that we've had have been pretty robust. So, we just announced a major expansion of the Riyadh, the new Riyadh airport that's going on that's in full force as well as the water infrastructure that we're putting in place. Our exposure on NEOM, even with the pullback on NEOM as far as the 170 kilometers, the work that's going on right now has not ours has not abated and continues to go on schedule for not just the personal canal that we're dedicating towards the job, but the growth that we see in the job as well.\nSangita Jain: That's super helpful. And if I can ask, you gave us a rundown of a lot of your key end markets. Maybe just a little bit on the power and energy market and what you may be seeing there here as well as in the U.K. on power, transmission and renewables?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. So, overall, solid -- the work that we're seeing both in Southeast Asia, in Australia, New Zealand and in Europe. And Europe, clearly driven by the geopolitical kind of impact that it's had on energy transition that continues. The interconnectors that we are, not just in the middle of in Europe, but the additional pursuits that we have in place kind of put some tailwinds there. I'd say in the US, it's been not just a market on its own, but it's also been an enabling market, our expertise around renewables and then taking that energy expertise in taking it to areas such as data centers and the EV ecosystem with regards to transportation. That's probably been a greater level of focus in the U.S. So kind of the diversity of our skill sets is really helping that energy and power group that we have. Again, it started off from a smaller base, but it's doubled in size just in the year.\nSangita Jain: Good. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nRobert Pragada: Hi, good morning, Chad.\nKevin Berryman: Good morning, Chad\nChad Dillard: So, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the PFAS legislation that was just handed down. Just trying to get a sense for how to think about timing for potential awards in your backlog, like what's the design cycle for that? And then can you also talk about how Jacobs is positioned to win there?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So Chad, you probably heard this before. Kind of the $200 billion that spans over the course of the next 25 years, that is across multiple end markets. And so we can see a direct time line to that over a long period of time as regulations continue to become more and more part of the law. The way PFAS -- within the DoD, DoD agencies, specifically the Navy and the Air Force as well as the Corps of Engineers, that's showing up as individual pursuits, and it's kind of in that $75 million to $100 million of annual revenue for us as an offering. What you don't see is probably the bigger piece of PFAS, which is in drinking water. And so the work that the PFAS remediation and PFAS consulting that we do within a water offering or within a -- whether it be water treatment or wastewater reclamation project, that continues to grow. So, to look at this as an incremental is going to be a little cloudy, but to see it as a catalyst for scope growth on existing work is kind of how we're looking at it. And these are, like I said on the first question, these are clients that we've had for a long time and will continue to be a critical part of our offering.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then just over on the infrastructure side, specifically on transportation. Can you talk about like how your pipeline is evolving? How's it changed this quarter versus maybe a year ago? Any color on that would be helpful.\nRobert Pragada: Sure. Pipeline growth is there, probably more indexed towards the US in what's the IIJA focus that's come through and you've seen that in some of our awards. So, I'd say the larger rail opportunities we talked about last quarter, we talked about this quarter, those continue. The highways work is continuing to grow. And then in Australia and in the Middle East as well, we're seeing continued growth in transport. I'd say that, the areas that as there's more stability that comes within the U.K., that we could see the growth coming in would be in the U.K. And then what's differentiating us amongst our -- not just our competitive pool, but creating more value for our clients is how we're enabling that with our digital platforms. So the use of StreetLight Data not just in our own work but how that's kind of almost revolutionizing our offering to clients is something that we've got it firmly embedded in the US. But we're now starting to see use cases come about both in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East and soon to come in Australia.\nChad Dillard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJustin Hauke: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just -- I wanted to clarify one thing on the guidance. The CMS outlook for the back half of the year, I think previously you guys were talking about kind of a mid-single-digit constant currency growth rate. It's a little bit below in the first half, but I think you were talking about some program losses that are going to pressure the second half. And so I just wanted to make sure that we understood kind of what that commentary meant and what your expectations are for the revenue growth in the back half of the year at CMS?\nKevin Berryman: Yes, Justin, we did have a loss, one, one that was somewhat sizable which impacts the, I would say, the short-term and I would call short-term Q3, Q4. While we have a lot of short-cycle awards that are filling in the gap fundamentally offsetting and mitigating the impacts of that, it probably puts us in -- in the short run to be more flattish as opposed to seeing the growth of single-digits, mid-single-digits. So, I think that's the dynamic at least in Q3, Q4. I would remind you that this is the business that is going to be transferred over. But I would tell you, the team is doing an amazing job in filling in and positioning for exiting 2024, putting itself back in a place to be seeing incremental growth in 2025.\nRobert Pragada: And maybe just one thing to add. The operational efficiencies that the team has really delivered through that double-digit bottom-line growth for this quarter, and we mentioned it last quarter as well, with operating margins that are now the highest that we've seen in the business is another real highlight for what we're doing within CMS.\nKevin Berryman: And that's a good point, Bob, because we shouldn't be seeing impacts on the margin profile, even though we're discussing this one item. But the team has done a really nice job on the margin front.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. And I guess my second one is just to ask on the corporate unallocated costs. The trending down to the $50 million, you're not expecting that line item to come down until post separation though, right? So, this kind of $58 million that you've had the last two quarters, that's kind of the run rate for the balance of the year. And then with the spin, that's when you would expect like the step function change in the first quarter of 25%. Is that still the right way to kind of think about it?\nKevin Berryman: That's correct.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nKevin Berryman: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nSahej Singh: Bob, Kevin, good morning. This is Sahej on for Bert.\nRobert Pragada: Hi. Good morning.\nKevin Berryman: Hi.\nSahej Singh: It seems like a lot of good questions have been asked. So I will ask about IIJA ramp. I think we've heard commentary more broadly from the industry and then even for you guys of an expectation of IIJA funding ramp to around 2026 or 2027. Are you still seeing that trend? Are you seeing that trend faster than expected? Any color there would be helpful.\nRobert Pragada: No, it's kind of still trending to that. We -- the trend on the new awards and how that money flows, 2026, 2027, I think we've mentioned last quarter that, that looks like it could get extended, but that's not because it's slowing down right now, because it started later than what was anticipated. But these awards that we've not just talked about today, but also what we've telegraphed for the second half of the year. Those are really being catalyzed by IIJA.\nSahej Singh: That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the prior question related to unallocated expenses. You've given good visibility into the post spin. I think I look at it as I was quickly doing the math, you're trending at about 2% on a trailing 12-month sales, so maybe on a percentage basis trailing 12-month post spin, where are you looking to get? I think it's been elevated post your PA Consulting acquisition in 2021?\nKevin Berryman: Well, look, I don't have the -- we're not targeting a percentage. We're targeting an absolute number, which we've communicated. There's a lot of moving pieces in that, which I just want to highlight, for example, we're conveying cost of the new organization. Part of our corporate infrastructure is going to be conveyed. There is going to be TSA revenue that we will receive from the transition period. So there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think it's safe to say that we're going to be targeting that number to be at that $50 net number at the end of the day as we go into 2025, got a lot of work to be able to execute against that. And look, the amount of effort that's being expended in this company right now relative to ensuring that we're creating a stand-alone entity that's going to be able to day one look to accelerate its level of growth given its effective focus on the government service side is not inconsequential. And I just want to reinforce that because it has impacts relative to the short-term ability for us to further reduce numbers at the end of the day. I can't tell you how pleased and proud I am actually of the teams, not only those that are actually dedicated to the separation and standup management office, but the rest of the organization, which is getting pulled away from their day jobs to help support the separation. So we're feeling really good about it.\nSahej Singh: Thank you. And then just last one for me is you mentioned the Riyadh airport. I think I saw some news flow on Dubai potentially expanding their airport. Is that a project that you guys are actively interested in pursuing on our in conversations around? Any color there would be incrementally helpful as a tailwind into the Middle East region more specifically?\nRobert Pragada: Yes and yes. It's our presence in Dubai on multifaceted infrastructure work, water, transportation and within transportation and aviation is reaching. We've been there for a decade, and that will continue to be a primary area of focus for us within the Middle East. And so the answer is yes.\nSahej Singh: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone.\nRobert Pragada: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich : Bob, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the data center opportunity for you folks. What does the scope of CapEx looks like for data centers for you folks compared to semi-cap equipment and your market share when we last spoke, the outlook for data center CapEx was, I don't know, probably 30% lower. So, I'm wondering, as you think about the outlook for advanced facilities could growth actually accelerate if your content on data centers is remotely similar to what it is for the semi-cap equipment? Thanks.\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Jerry, if you look at data centers as a percentage of -- from a deployed capital perspective of a percentage of kind of call it the electronics universe, it is just -- this is not Jacobs. It's just -- it is a minority share of the billions that get put into chip manufacturing and then the entire life cycle of the chip delivery profile to the market. So, that's kind of point one. But the rate of growth really driven by AI and the needs for these data centers is what's driving our business. So we see that growing. From a pure design perspective, these are not overall -- the facility itself is not the real complicated component. What's becoming more complicated are the power needs and the cooling needs, the water needs. So, that's what our teams are really focused in on. You've seen probably some of the bigger power management companies Eaton and Schneider and others talk about how it's driving their business that goes into the hardware that's going into data centers. But the consultancy piece, that power and water usage is going to be a bigger piece of how we kind of expand that value proposition there.\nJerry Revich: And in terms of within People & Places, really good top line growth and you mentioned there's some bookings coming up. Can you just calibrate us which of your end markets were the biggest drivers of growth in the quarter and based on what's in backlog and bookings, which end markets do you expect to be above segment average growth over the next couple of quarters?\nRobert Pragada: Water and Life Sciences. Those two right now, even as far as rates at a point in time that represents probably over 50% of that P&PS growth. And then when we look at the pipeline moving forward, those are pipelines that are, as I mentioned before, doubling in size, and that's global. So, areas that might have some geo-economic challenges such as the U.K. If you look at the water bookings and the growth in water in those geographies, that's growing. And of course, that's been a driver, both in the U.S. as well as in Australia and the Middle East, too. So Life Sciences Europe and U.S. wire globally.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nRobert Pragada: Hi, good morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: Can you just comment maybe on labor availability, inflation retention on a geographic basis? Where is it still hot? Or is it getting a little better?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. It's not all over. And as far as wage inflation, we still -- it's there, but our ability to kind of look at value-added solutions for our clients and looking on how we can continue to deliver at a price point that drives the capital deployment from our clients. That has not really changed as we continue to innovate in that space. What's really helped us, Josh, has been our global delivery model. If we look at the engagements that we have, whether they be smaller consultancy engagements or larger programs, these jobs and these engagements with our clients have literally got people from all over our global delivery platforms. And so -- and we're going to continue with that because it's not necessarily the cost arbitrage that might be an outcome, but it's the talent arbitrage, and our talent is literally in every geography that we have today. So it has not really been a big issue for us.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then just on the short-cycle wins you mentioned in the comments there, where specifically were those? Any structural shift in focus or is that just opportunistic?\nRobert Pragada: No. It's probably been focused around telecom, weapon sustainment, and then some scope growth that we see in our aerospace work as well.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the conference back over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. We really look forward to providing further updates and visiting with all of you and investors and analysts in the months to come, and look forward to engaging first hand. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q2 results, leading to another strong quarter. We are steadfast in our commitment to providing high-value solutions with improved margins, supported by our continued emphasis on operational excellence and execution. So, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. Second quarter gross revenue grew 5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 3%. GAAP operating profit was $281 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $58 million of transaction, restructuring, and other costs, including $47 million associated with the separation transaction. We still expect our total restructuring cost to be approximately $275 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by the separation transaction. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.28 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.34 from transaction, restructuring, and other related costs, all of which were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.91, marking a 7% decrease compared to the previous year. When adjusting for last year's second quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.32, our current non-GAAP EPS represents an approximately 10% year-over-year increase. Looking forward, we anticipate maintaining an annual effective tax rate of 22% for the full fiscal year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $393 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing a strong 11.3% adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 2% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.96 times with our gross profit and backlog increasing 4% year-over-year. Excluding a one-time change in government funding strategy with regard to Space ISR programs, which I'll describe in more detail during my segment comments, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been approximately 1.06 times, with significant strength in pipeline growth and expected large wins in Q3 and Q4. Regarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8. We are particularly pleased with our performance in People & Places Solutions. Q2 adjusted net revenue was up 5.6% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit growth was strong at 15.3%. Reflecting our commitment to higher end profitable growth, the segment saw a record adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business. Our backlog has grown by 2% year-over-year and we've seen a 7% increase in the gross profit in our backlog. This improvement reflects our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of our bids and project wins as we expect some critical large wins to occur in Q3. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q2 revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year with backlog up 3.9%. Our adjusted operating profit was up 10.3% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year as the business continued to find avenues of operational improvements. While a recent program loss will put some short-term pressure on the second half, our recent successes in shorter-cycle awards is expected to help mitigate the impact. Our work remains mission-critical, allowing the business to show long-term resilience against shifts in government funding and program adjustments. Let's now focus on Divergent Solutions. During Q2, we observed an 11% year-over-year decrease in adjusted net revenue and 24% decrease year-over-year in adjusted operating profit. Excluding a one-time Palantir license in the previous period, adjusted operating profit would have been up 13% year-over-year. While backlog was negatively impacted by a change in funding strategy with the DoD on space-based ISR programs, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in near-term sales, which we believe will contribute to our ongoing success. Now, let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q2 saw a slight decline of 2% in year-over-year revenue, driven by a continued challenging macro environment in the consulting industry and a solid year ago comparable. However, cost and execution discipline helped deliver a strong adjusted operating margin of 20.5%, a 270 basis point increase from the previous sequential quarter. As we emphasized during our last earnings call, our industry position is uniquely differentiated and our work is both purposeful and critical. As a result, PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong adjusted operating profit margins, targeting above 20% for the second half of the year. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q2. We continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model and driving costs down. We expect this line item post separation to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually. Turning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. After delivering a strong free cash flow in Q1, our quarterly free cash flow was negative $71 million in Q2 as working capital increased the planned levels from the exceptional performance in Q1. Despite this impact in the second quarter, our reported free cash flow conversion for the first half of the year has remained at approximately 100%. And as a result, we are well-positioned to deliver on our forecast, maintaining 100% reported as well as adjusted free cash flow conversion for the full year. Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $95 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We still have $679 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders, while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and gross debt of $3 billion. Our Q2 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.3 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength of the balance sheet, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt having become current in Q2. We have ample options: refinancing, using proceeds from our upcoming separation transaction, and/or accessing our revolver. As of the end of Q2, approximately 37% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.2%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and year-to-date free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29, an 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on June 21st. Bob, back over to you. Good morning Andy. Yes. Look, I think the dynamics associated with Divergent and you're right, that part of the business is going to be part of the separation, so it's in the parameter of the separation transaction, Andy. And look, there was a change in funding strategy, whereby the technology and associated projects that we have are still considered viable and probably the best technologies to be utilizing going forward, but because of deciding how they were going to be funding it, DoD is handing over that responsibility to the intelligence community. So, while long-term, we have a reduction -- well, short-term, we have a reduction in our backlog because the DoD is handing that over, we're starting to, right now, see immediate build back up in some of those projects being now embedded into the intelligence community. While it represents certainly a delay in some of the burn of that project, our expectation is longer term, that DVS will start to see that same backlog come back into their kind of backlog over the course of the next year-plus, and consequently, we'll have to build up the burn once again. And so if you think about those two dynamics, I think those are kind of short-term dynamics when you include People & Places. And when you see the outlook for the rest of the year, we're feeling pretty good about our backlog growth and book-to-bill over the balance of the year. Thanks Andy. Sorry, didn't follow the question. No. Look, I think at the end of the day, we feel as if we're being prudent in our guidance, and it still represents a 13% year-over-year kind of increase in EPS. So, I think at the end, we're sitting here saying, that's a good ending result. We're being prudent in the establishment of that. And of course, it's offsetting some of the things that we know are already in our numbers, the inventory write-offs that we had in the first quarter. So, I think it's quite actually a positive. Thanks Mike. Yes. Look, I think the team has done a really good job, Mike, relative to rightsizing the organization, given some of the challenges in the overall consulting industry, which obviously is impacting PA to a certain extent. But they're very well positioned, especially in the U.K. market. And so we're feeling good about their ability to be delivering that 20% plus margin in the back half of the year. And so longer term, I think that, that translates into numbers going on from there as well. And look, I think as we enter the end of the calendar year, we do have the dynamic of the U.K. election. So, we're going to have to watch that carefully to see what impacts are -- but what we have right now is pretty clear visibility on our Q3 and Q4 reported numbers in terms of the health of the PA business, not substantial growth, but certainly good solid execution in the balance of the fiscal year for us. Well, let me start on the first one. Look, I think 15.3% that we saw people in place is a record, is at a high level. And consequently, I don't think we can assume that every quarter is going to be 15.3% just because of the factors associated with cost of mix and what actually hit us during a particular quarter. I will say that as we think about our margin profile, we're feeling better about it today than we felt last quarter. So I can characterize it from that perspective. It doesn't mean we're going to hit 15.3% in Q3 and Q4, but I think we're going to end the year at numbers that are going to be pretty darn attractive. Good morning, Chad Yes, Justin, we did have a loss, one, one that was somewhat sizable which impacts the, I would say, the short-term and I would call short-term Q3, Q4. While we have a lot of short-cycle awards that are filling in the gap fundamentally offsetting and mitigating the impacts of that, it probably puts us in -- in the short run to be more flattish as opposed to seeing the growth of single-digits, mid-single-digits. So, I think that's the dynamic at least in Q3, Q4. I would remind you that this is the business that is going to be transferred over. But I would tell you, the team is doing an amazing job in filling in and positioning for exiting 2024, putting itself back in a place to be seeing incremental growth in 2025. And that's a good point, Bob, because we shouldn't be seeing impacts on the margin profile, even though we're discussing this one item. But the team has done a really nice job on the margin front. That's correct. Thanks, Justin. Hi. Well, look, I don't have the -- we're not targeting a percentage. We're targeting an absolute number, which we've communicated. There's a lot of moving pieces in that, which I just want to highlight, for example, we're conveying cost of the new organization. Part of our corporate infrastructure is going to be conveyed. There is going to be TSA revenue that we will receive from the transition period. So there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think it's safe to say that we're going to be targeting that number to be at that $50 net number at the end of the day as we go into 2025, got a lot of work to be able to execute against that. And look, the amount of effort that's being expended in this company right now relative to ensuring that we're creating a stand-alone entity that's going to be able to day one look to accelerate its level of growth given its effective focus on the government service side is not inconsequential. And I just want to reinforce that because it has impacts relative to the short-term ability for us to further reduce numbers at the end of the day. I can't tell you how pleased and proud I am actually of the teams, not only those that are actually dedicated to the separation and standup management office, but the rest of the organization, which is getting pulled away from their day jobs to help support the separation. So we're feeling really good about it."

            "name": "Robert Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Ayan. Good day everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I want to welcome Kevin Berryman, previously our President and Chief Financial Officer back, following his appointment as interim CFO. Kevin brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role, having served as our CFO for over nine years. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in navigating significant transformations and driving growth across our organization and most recently, has demonstrated exceptional leadership in overseeing the ongoing separation of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence businesses as well as its planned strategic merger with Amentum. As we move forward, we have initiated to search for a permanent CFO with the assistance of an executive search firm. We are working towards concluding this search expeditiously and are grateful that Kevin has agreed to remain at Jacobs through the close of the separation transaction to provide overlap with our next CFO and ensure a smooth transition. Now, moving to Slide 4. I want to emphasize our solid progress on the cost optimization plan. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure, expanding margins, and accelerating profitable growth across our lines of business. Our strategic shift towards a less complex, higher value, and higher margin portfolio remains on track. We are actively identifying opportunities to streamline our operating model and enhance efficiency, while continuing to deliver world-class value-added scientific-based, digitally-enabled solutions to create a more connected and sustainable world. We have made significant progress on our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence separation planning. We're pleased to report that we have now achieved a significant milestone by receiving all approvals and clearances under competition and foreign direct investment laws that are conditioned to the separation transaction. We are steadily advancing our Form 10 filing targeted for early summer. We expect to fulfill the remaining closing conditions and complete the transaction in the second half of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Turning to Slide 5 and Q2. I'm pleased to report solid second quarter consolidated revenue, driven by 5% growth and 3% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year and gross margin in backlog increased approximately 50 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our business will continue to deliver profitable growth. Turning to Slide 6. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another quarter of solid top line growth as we continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth. As demonstrated by P&PS, record adjusted operating margin of 15.3% and strong adjusted operating profit growth of 15.3% year-on-year. We continue to drive organic revenue growth up 7.5% and adjusted up 5.6% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic revenue growth of mid to high single-digits in FY 2024. During the quarter, we have delivered several marquee wins across multiple core market sectors. In transportation, we have been selected as Amtrak's delivery partner for the $6 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, America's busiest passenger railroad, one of the largest national transportation and infrastructure investments and the most significant IIJA Award to-date. The team will provide program and construction management services from contract initiation through service commissioning for two high-capacity tunnel tubes for electrified passenger trains, improving rail systems and enhancing accessibility to transform this 10-mile section of the Northeast Corridor. PA Consulting is an integral part of our program management team, demonstrating their emerging presence in transport in the U.S. and the power of our collaborative partnership. In Aviation, we continue our long-term relationship with Los Angeles World Airports to provide program management services at Los Angeles International Airport. Infrastructure improvements at LAX will enhance the city's preparedness for upcoming sporting events, including the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. Water remains a critical growth catalyst with several strategic wins across our key geographies, further bolstering our position in the sector, as evidenced by our appointment by Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer Department to design upgrades for the county's three wastewater treatment plants, benefiting nearly 2.4 million residents and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Jacobs will incorporate Intelligent O&M, a digital one water solution from its suite of digital products to provide our confident decision-making and to achieve greater efficiencies, reducing wastewater treatment costs, and optimizing operational labor. Additionally, we were selected by United Utilities, one of the U.K.'s largest listed water companies to its strategic solutions team supporting program optimization for major capital works through the AMP8 and AMP9 cycles, which cover the period from 2025 to 2035. Furthermore, we were selected by Water Corporation, the largest water utility in Western Australia to design, build, operate, and maintain the Alkimos Seawater Desalinization Plant in Perth, Australia. The project, part of an alliance with Water Corporation and ACCIONA is expected to ultimately produce 26 billion gallons of drinking water. In recent weeks, significant regulatory steps have been taken in the environmental sector. The U.S. EPA set maximum contaminant levels for five PFAS compounds. The first major U.S. drinking water legislation in 20 years and classified two PFAS compounds as hazardous under the Superfund program, expanding our potential for environmental management and compliance services. Internationally, the EU has also progressed, banning certain PFAS compounds and moving forward with risk evaluations. These developments are expected to increase demand for our consulting, engineering, and remediation services. We've been working with and advising our clients about how these anticipated regulations will impact them since discussions began some years ago. Now, that the regulations are finalized, we're having robust conversations with our clients about their options to navigate this next chapter. PA Consultant is working with companies that have PFAS materials in their products and advising on how to remove them from their products and supply chains as well as assessing how to create alternative materials. With our expertise, strong market presence, and leading position as demonstrated by our ongoing work with the Department of Defense, U.K. government, and Australian Aviation authorities, Jacobs is ready to lead in this evolving space. In Life Sciences, our overall pipeline continues to grow at double-digit rates year-over-year, driven by long-term relationships. There are significant opportunities in the pipeline and we are well-positioned for continued growth. In CMS, Q2 revenue was up 3% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit increased 10% with approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. The CMS team is executing well, and we continue to see several positive trends for long-term growth as the team prepares for the merger with Amentum. PA Consulting delivered among an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 20.5% with solid execution and cost discipline. We continue to expect the remaining quarters in FY 2024 to exceed 20% adjusted operating margin. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator for us with some nice wins in the quarter, including the previously mentioned Frederick Douglass Tunnel and an appointment to the HM Revenue & Customs multibillion-pound framework in the U.K., intended to upgrade software systems across the government agency. Divergent Solutions delivered a solid adjusted operating margin performance at approximately 10% and adjusted operating profit growth, which would have been approximately 13% excluding a large license sale to Palantir in the comparison period. Our suite of digital products and platforms are elevating the value we can provide to our clients globally. In summary, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our core market sectors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 10. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives. As a result, we are narrowing the range for fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion, and adjusted EPS to $7.80 to $8.10, representing a 9% and 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.91 and a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, this represents a 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year ago period. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Hi, good morning Andy. Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with P&PS and then Kevin can talk about kind of the entirety. So, in P&PS, Andy, a couple of things. One is timing. We've got -- let me first off by saying that as a gross number, the P&PS backlog represents a record backlog for the segment since we formed it nearly five years ago. So, kind of point one there. As far as the growth, we've kind of got tied a little bit into some timing of some of the larger programs that drive the backlog. Our book-to-bill is still over 1, and in the second half with expected awards, some of which we've already received in the first month of the quarter, we're going to see a real acceleration in the backlog in P&PS. Kevin, you want to talk about the overall as well as Divergent? Yes. So, on the first part, that allocation hasn't changed since we talked about it last quarter, so that's remained consistent. And we're not going to change that philosophy. Really, this quarter, the mix that we saw specifically around Water and Life Sciences, when we think about it, those are two segments, Andy, that are growing at double-digit rates. And from a pipeline standpoint, I mean, both are nearly -- the pipelines are doubling on a year-on-year basis. So, that mix of higher-margin work that's coming in is really driving that growth. Can you say that again? I'm sorry. Yes. Project selectivity is -- we've always had that. And that has become kind of a primary focus for us as the opportunities have increased. Talk a little bit about Water and Life Sciences, in our Transportation business right now, our win rates have been the highest, you could say, in the highest in the market. And they've been the highest that we've experienced, and a lot of that comes from because it's subjective evaluation from what we put our effort and our money behind on trending. Probably the biggest component of that is around long-term client relationships. We're not out looking for work. We've been with our clients for decades. And if you think about 3,700 clients around the world and over the course of the last 20 years, that's a 2% client turnover. And so when we're with a client, we're there for the long-term. Hi Mike. Sure. So maybe I'll start with in sciences and then talk about semi kind of the electronics world right now. I mentioned this before, Mike, within our life sciences world, you've heard a lot about GLP-1 and everything is going around the obesity drug. If you look at the two biggest ones that are in that space, our work that we do for them represents nearly over 50% of the capital that they put in place. So that work continues to be a big driver. But what's also happening is two other dynamics. One is around oncology. There are quite a few advances that are happening around oncology. And so timing on those was maybe a little slower than we wanted over the course of the last few quarters. But going into the second half, those jobs are right in front of us, and we're well positioned for those. The last dynamic around Life Sciences is just sheer capacity. Here, the CEOs of life sciences companies and biotech companies talk about capacity as the biggest choke point. The contract manufacturing world is on the rise as well. So we'll have some good news here in the second half and actually in Q3 around what's going on in that contract manufacturing space. Semiconductor, a lot of stuff in the news right now about the ubiquitous world of chip manufacturing and how AI is driving not just chip manufacturing but also data centers. We're seeing that. The chips money has now been delivered to the market, and some of the largest players have benefited from that. So we're seeing projects that we've already been involved with talk about Phase 2 of those. And so we'll have more to say as those become public in the second half, but it's really the entirety of the ecosystem of the chip manufacturing and semiconductor world. Starting from the R&D facility through manufacturing and now you'll hear a lot more about test and assembly and those test and assembly facilities coming to the US. So, we're excited about what's going on. And then in data centers, the power usage of these are creating opportunities for us with regards to power and cooling, the water requirements on now what could be 1 gigawatt data center. So, really, really positive story there. Yes. Maybe I'll make a couple of comments on the opportunities and on backlog, and then Kevin can talk about the margins. What gets embedded in is the PA backlog was actually up 8% year-over-year. And so we're starting to see that momentum of those opportunities and those collaborative opportunities come through. So that's exciting news there. And a lot around the U.K. macro has been driving the business with at least hopefully some clarity that there'll be an election in the U.K. in the second half of the year, we're already starting to see the pipeline grow in the sales performance in the last month of the quarter kind of drove the business. So, the momentum is there. And then given we're talking about the margin. And then on the awards, Jamie, those are -- when I say are they part of the guide or not part of the guide, our guide incorporates the probability waiting for the award. But we're feeling optimistic about not just the award anticipated awards, but the pipeline. The pipeline is looking extremely robust in PPS. Sure. So maybe I'll just talk about broadly Saudi and then specifically on NEOM. Broadly, Saudi, the pipeline of work continues. And it's -- for us, it's a diverse pipeline. We don't index towards a specific type of offering. We've got value-added services that we provide to the entire life cycle of these programs. And if you look at the pipeline, the infrastructure component of it, the transportation, whether it be in aviation or in rail as well as the water opportunities that we've had have been pretty robust. So, we just announced a major expansion of the Riyadh, the new Riyadh airport that's going on that's in full force as well as the water infrastructure that we're putting in place. Our exposure on NEOM, even with the pullback on NEOM as far as the 170 kilometers, the work that's going on right now has not ours has not abated and continues to go on schedule for not just the personal canal that we're dedicating towards the job, but the growth that we see in the job as well. Sure. So, overall, solid -- the work that we're seeing both in Southeast Asia, in Australia, New Zealand and in Europe. And Europe, clearly driven by the geopolitical kind of impact that it's had on energy transition that continues. The interconnectors that we are, not just in the middle of in Europe, but the additional pursuits that we have in place kind of put some tailwinds there. I'd say in the US, it's been not just a market on its own, but it's also been an enabling market, our expertise around renewables and then taking that energy expertise in taking it to areas such as data centers and the EV ecosystem with regards to transportation. That's probably been a greater level of focus in the U.S. So kind of the diversity of our skill sets is really helping that energy and power group that we have. Again, it started off from a smaller base, but it's doubled in size just in the year. Hi, good morning, Chad. Yes. So Chad, you probably heard this before. Kind of the $200 billion that spans over the course of the next 25 years, that is across multiple end markets. And so we can see a direct time line to that over a long period of time as regulations continue to become more and more part of the law. The way PFAS -- within the DoD, DoD agencies, specifically the Navy and the Air Force as well as the Corps of Engineers, that's showing up as individual pursuits, and it's kind of in that $75 million to $100 million of annual revenue for us as an offering. What you don't see is probably the bigger piece of PFAS, which is in drinking water. And so the work that the PFAS remediation and PFAS consulting that we do within a water offering or within a -- whether it be water treatment or wastewater reclamation project, that continues to grow. So, to look at this as an incremental is going to be a little cloudy, but to see it as a catalyst for scope growth on existing work is kind of how we're looking at it. And these are, like I said on the first question, these are clients that we've had for a long time and will continue to be a critical part of our offering. Sure. Pipeline growth is there, probably more indexed towards the US in what's the IIJA focus that's come through and you've seen that in some of our awards. So, I'd say the larger rail opportunities we talked about last quarter, we talked about this quarter, those continue. The highways work is continuing to grow. And then in Australia and in the Middle East as well, we're seeing continued growth in transport. I'd say that, the areas that as there's more stability that comes within the U.K., that we could see the growth coming in would be in the U.K. And then what's differentiating us amongst our -- not just our competitive pool, but creating more value for our clients is how we're enabling that with our digital platforms. So the use of StreetLight Data not just in our own work but how that's kind of almost revolutionizing our offering to clients is something that we've got it firmly embedded in the US. But we're now starting to see use cases come about both in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East and soon to come in Australia. And maybe just one thing to add. The operational efficiencies that the team has really delivered through that double-digit bottom-line growth for this quarter, and we mentioned it last quarter as well, with operating margins that are now the highest that we've seen in the business is another real highlight for what we're doing within CMS. Hi. Good morning. No, it's kind of still trending to that. We -- the trend on the new awards and how that money flows, 2026, 2027, I think we've mentioned last quarter that, that looks like it could get extended, but that's not because it's slowing down right now, because it started later than what was anticipated. But these awards that we've not just talked about today, but also what we've telegraphed for the second half of the year. Those are really being catalyzed by IIJA. Yes and yes. It's our presence in Dubai on multifaceted infrastructure work, water, transportation and within transportation and aviation is reaching. We've been there for a decade, and that will continue to be a primary area of focus for us within the Middle East. And so the answer is yes. Hi, Jerry. Yes, Jerry, if you look at data centers as a percentage of -- from a deployed capital perspective of a percentage of kind of call it the electronics universe, it is just -- this is not Jacobs. It's just -- it is a minority share of the billions that get put into chip manufacturing and then the entire life cycle of the chip delivery profile to the market. So, that's kind of point one. But the rate of growth really driven by AI and the needs for these data centers is what's driving our business. So we see that growing. From a pure design perspective, these are not overall -- the facility itself is not the real complicated component. What's becoming more complicated are the power needs and the cooling needs, the water needs. So, that's what our teams are really focused in on. You've seen probably some of the bigger power management companies Eaton and Schneider and others talk about how it's driving their business that goes into the hardware that's going into data centers. But the consultancy piece, that power and water usage is going to be a bigger piece of how we kind of expand that value proposition there. Water and Life Sciences. Those two right now, even as far as rates at a point in time that represents probably over 50% of that P&PS growth. And then when we look at the pipeline moving forward, those are pipelines that are, as I mentioned before, doubling in size, and that's global. So, areas that might have some geo-economic challenges such as the U.K. If you look at the water bookings and the growth in water in those geographies, that's growing. And of course, that's been a driver, both in the U.S. as well as in Australia and the Middle East, too. So Life Sciences Europe and U.S. wire globally. Hi, good morning, Josh. Yes. It's not all over. And as far as wage inflation, we still -- it's there, but our ability to kind of look at value-added solutions for our clients and looking on how we can continue to deliver at a price point that drives the capital deployment from our clients. That has not really changed as we continue to innovate in that space. What's really helped us, Josh, has been our global delivery model. If we look at the engagements that we have, whether they be smaller consultancy engagements or larger programs, these jobs and these engagements with our clients have literally got people from all over our global delivery platforms. And so -- and we're going to continue with that because it's not necessarily the cost arbitrage that might be an outcome, but it's the talent arbitrage, and our talent is literally in every geography that we have today. So it has not really been a big issue for us. No. It's probably been focused around telecom, weapon sustainment, and then some scope growth that we see in our aerospace work as well. Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. We really look forward to providing further updates and visiting with all of you and investors and analysts in the months to come, and look forward to engaging first hand. Thank you, everyone."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Evans, VP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Evans: Thank you, Audra. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics.  We have also introduced a new supplement that consolidates certain information, including our non-GAAP financial tables. Additionally, beginning with this quarter, the company will no longer apply an adjustment to adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS, which previously resulted in the application of the expected annual tax rate to all quarterly periods. Prior comparable periods are also being presented on this basis.  Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our first quarter results. Claudia will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow.  With that, I'll turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure and accelerating profitable growth and margin expansion across our lines of business. Our team continues to demonstrate great resilience and dedication as we delivered better-than-expected underlying results in Q1, while also working to the added task of standing up 2 independent companies. At the corporate level, we are diligently working to create a leaner operating model that aligns Jacobs' position as a global leader in delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions to our clients. And allowing us to benefit fully from the broad-based strength that we see in global infrastructure and sustainability investments.  We are confident that our actions we are taking are providing the foundation for multiyear improvement in profitability and margins, and we look forward to sharing more detail in the quarters to come.  Turning to Slide 4. I want to provide a brief update on a few key milestones related to the spin-off and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions in Cyber and Intelligence businesses with momentum. We continue to progress towards closing of the transaction in the second half of fiscal year 2024, consistent with our previous expectations. Together with momentum, we are making progress on preparing our Form 10 and private letter ruling request in keeping with the established time line of the transaction.  Additionally, we are progressing antitrust filings and regulatory approvals. Upon the public filing of the Form 10, we aim to offer more comprehensive information and look forward to introducing the combined leadership team to our investors and analysts later this spring.  I would also likely -- like to briefly touch on the cost optimization plan that we outlined last quarter. Our transformation to a less vulnerable and higher-value, higher-margin portfolio is well underway. We continue to find new ways to streamline our operating model. And while it is too early to positively revise our targets, we are increasingly confident in our ability to enhance our long-term profitability. As we progress towards separation and optimizing our corporate cost structure, we now are able to better align costs to the applicable business units.  As a result, we have made the decision to shift some corporate unallocated costs into the current P&PS segment, which will allow for greater long-term recovery of our corporate overhead. While this has the effect of temporarily weighing on our segment operating margins, this has no impact on our bottom line today. Rather, this will boost corporate profitability in the long run as we gradually recover cost from public sector clients. Providing upside beyond the initial 13.8% adjusted EBITDA margin target set for stand-alone Jacobs, post separation that we shared last quarter. This adds to our conviction that our transformation will drive multiyear value creation.  Turning to Slide 5. In Q1, I'm pleased to report a strong first quarter revenue driven by 9.5% gross and 7.9% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 5% year-over-year, and gross margin in backlog improved 29 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our businesses can continue their profitable growth trends.  This quarter's results include a onetime noncash $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding this item, adjusted operating profit would have increased versus the prior year period. We saw a continuation of strong organic growth in P&PS with 8.4% adjusted net revenue growth. We had a Q1 operating cash flow of $418 million, up 38% year-over-year. Strong cash conversion is a hallmark of our asset-light business model and remain robust in Q1 with $401 million in free cash flow, and we expect to generate greater than 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024. The ultimate measure of our ability to create value is long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and that will continue to be our North Star.  Turning to Slide 6. Our People & Places line of business generated strong top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 8.4% year-over-year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 6% organic growth. We continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth as demonstrated by gross profit and backlog increasing 7% year-over-year.  Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic growth of mid- to high-single digits in FY '24. We anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.  The water market remains to be a pacesetter within the company. In particular, water scarcity continues to trend across the globe, affecting billions of people. Decades of increasing population growth and agricultural demand have significantly depleted the quantity and quality of water resources. Jacobs is a leader in developing solutions to address water scarcity, including water reuse, groundwater management and desalinization.  In the Americas, California and Colorado have recently adopted regulations for direct potable reuse. And Arizona is making positive strides towards adopting similar regulations. Notably, the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, is currently building a new semiconductor facility in Arizona. We've been selected for the first phase of the design and project delivery of the campus' industrial reclaimed water plant. In addition, multiple states in the U.S. are developing regional water supply plants to balance water availability and economic growth. As an example of such work, we were awarded a $191 million project in St. Johns County, Florida for the design and project delivery of a water reclamation facility.  This facility will treat 3.25 million gallons of water daily for beneficial reuse with 13 miles of transitioning pipelines to deliver reclaimed water for residential irrigation.  In transportation, we have a long-term relationship with Brightline West and have been awarded the design of the 218-mile high-speed rail linking Las Vegas to Southern California. Brightline West through a partnership with Nevada successfully secured $3 billion in grants from the Federal Railroad Administration as part of the IIJA funding.  In Life Sciences, we're supporting Lilly, with permitting and conceptual design for their injectable manufacturing facility in Alzey, Germany, to support an increased demand for their medicines, including their diabetes and obesity portfolio.  We continue to secure additional large engagements in the Middle East. For example, we've been appointed to provide preliminary and detail design and supervision services for utility and road infrastructure, including major road upgrades for Wadi Safar and Diriyah Gate 2 in Saudi Arabia.  In CMS, we performed very well in Q1, continuing the profitability trend demonstrated in FY '23. CMS' Q1 revenue was up 5% over year and operating profit increased 14% behind 63 basis points of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remains strong with major award prospects in FY '24 and a light recompete schedule. The CMS team is executing well and has great momentum as they prepare to be an independent company.  PA Consulting continues to take share as demonstrated by an 8.5% revenue growth in what continues to be a choppy macro environment, particularly in the U.K. Margins were light due to some softness in December. However, we continue to expect approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year and have confidence in our ability to manage variable costs to achieve that goal.  Together with PA, we celebrated new wins with the office of gas and electricity markets in the U.K. for program management services and regulatory practices that will advance the safe and secure supply of hydrogen.  Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a solid quarter with 5% adjusted net revenue growth. Profits were impacted by an approximately $15 million onetime in connection with the merger. Underlying performance in the business was strong and excluded this write-down. Adjusted operating margins would have been approximately 700 basis points higher and exceeded our expectations for the quarter.  In summary, we remain well positioned to grow while serving our clients with excellence and delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions for a more connected and sustainable world. And we continue generating strong free cash flow conversion, which will enable us to return capital to shareholders as we chart our new path forward as 2 independent companies.  Now I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail.\nClaudia Jaramillo: Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which came in above our expectations. Our results illustrate our ability to deliver on our long-standing financial objectives, while at the same time, generating strong free cash flow and returning a significant portion of our cash to shareholders.  So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. First quarter gross revenue grew 9.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $204 million for the quarter and included $51 million of amortization for acquired intangibles and $60 million of other transaction, separation related restructuring and other costs. This includes $51 million associated with the separation of CMS. Our adjusted operating margin was 9.8%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reported segment review.  GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.37 per share. And included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.37 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.02, up 28% year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS included a $0.49 benefit related to a discrete tax item and a $0.09 headwind related to the noncash inventory write-down.  Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $328 million and was down 3.1% year-over-year, representing 10% of our adjusted net working capital. Excluding the inventory write-down, adjusted EBITDA would be roughly flat year-over-year. The effective tax rate of 4.2% benefited from $61.6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the permanent reinvestment of capital gains associated with an overseas subsidiary. This tax benefit was incorporated in our annual guidance and we continue to forecast the 22% annual effective tax rate to fiscal year 2024.  We will no longer be adjusting our non-GAAP EPS to align with our full year effective tax rate expectations. With the entirety of the deferred tax benefit in Q1, we now expect quarterly effective tax rate to approximate 26% to 27% for each quarter of the remainder of the fiscal year.  Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1.12x, with our gross profit in backlog increasing 6.1% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our [indiscernible] in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8.  Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q1 adjusted net revenue was up 8.4% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was down slightly, resulting in adjusted operating margins of 13.7%. However, excluding the impact of cost allocation changes previously mentioned, adjusted operating profit would have resulted in approximately 7% year-over-year growth. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business and anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.  Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q1 revenue increased 5% year-over-year with backlog up 9%, continuing a consistent trend of high-single-digit growth over multiple quarters. We also continue to find avenues through operational improvement with CMS operating margins rising by 63 basis points year-over-year.  Shifting to Divergent Solutions. In Q1, our adjusted net revenue increased by 4.7% year-over-year. Underlying execution was strong. Adjusted operating profit was $8 million, including the $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding the one-off write-down, performance was above expectations.  Now let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q1 saw an 8.5% year-over-year revenue increase. PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline. However, the U.K.'s ongoing election cycle introduces macro risks that we are closely monitoring. We remain confident in our ability to navigate these factors by managing variable costs and are targeting approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year. In total, it was a strong quarter for each of our segments from an execution standpoint.  Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q1. This quarter's cost excluded previously mentioned costs that are now being allocated to the P&PS segment. As we continue to enhance operational efficiencies and optimize our operating model, we expect this line item to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually post debt pressure.  Turning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted another quarter of strong cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. As Bob mentioned, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $401 million. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings.  Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent returns to our shareholders. We still have $775 million remaining under last year's repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders in aligning with our overarching goal of compounding free cash flow per share.  We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.14 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion. Our Q1 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.2x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q1, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.1%.  Finally, with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized an 11.5% increase to $0.29 per quarter, and our quarterly dividend will be paid on March 22. With this, we have increased our dividends each year since 2018, driving a nearly 12% dividend CAGR over that period.  Now I will turn it back to Bob.\nRobert Pragada: Thank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to be energized as interest in our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains robust as clients engage Jacobs to solve their most complex challenges. Internally, we remain focused on execution and continuing to deliver against our operational and financial objectives. We reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.60 billion, with adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing 9% and 10% growth at midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.02 and as Claudia shared, a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of this fiscal year.  Though we expect a heavier than normal cost structure until separation, particularly in [indiscernible], we anticipate accelerating EPS growth in the second half of the fiscal year.  In closing, we've maintained focus on standing up both independent Jacobs and CMS for success while streamlining and optimizing our operating model and positioning both companies for long-term value creation.  Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Andy Wittmann at Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: Oh, great. I guess for those who are unfamiliar, including myself to some extent here, on the SG&A reallocation into the segment, I think what you're saying there is if -- in these reimbursable public sector customers that you have, if you can show -- if it's in the segment, you can get paid basically for those costs. I think that's the mechanism. I just wanted to clarify that. And maybe, Claudia, could you talk about what the dollar amount on an annual basis is on the reallocation from the SG&A line into the segment? .\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Andy, it's a great question. It's actually a nice lead-in. So your assessment of that recoverability is correct. And if you just kind of just moment -- for a moment, kind of pre planning for the separation and outpost. Pre, we had a lot of shared costs. And so the direct applicability through the segment was not as clear. And since we started this, we had a great opportunity to now have direct line of sight to where these are being applied. Hit it right in the beginning of the audit cycle, the government audit cycle in Q1 and now have the full year of applying those costs.  So that's -- that's correct. Now on the full year amount, it would be the $17 million that we identified this year -- I'm sorry, this quarter multiplied by 4. But remember, over each quarter that goes down because of the recoverability effect. Did that make sense?\nAndrew Wittmann: Yes, I guess it does. The -- I mean the -- so I guess, with -- in the corporate unallocated reported at $59 million for the quarter, I guess what you're saying is unadjusted, that number would have been $17 million higher. In other words, that $59 million benefits from the $17 million that was moved?\nRobert Pragada: That's correct.\nAndrew Wittmann: Can you just talk about -- underlying that business -- or underlying the underlying costs for the corporate unallocated. Were there any other costs that are notable in terms of separation or other things through the SG&A line right now? Certainly, there's been these efficiency initiatives, Bob, that you've talked a lot about. But is there anything else we should know about that wasn't excluded from that corporate unallocated line?\nRobert Pragada: No. No, the $9 million of transition costs took it to $59 million and then the $17 million that we were able to, from a positive standpoint, move into P&PS and get recoverability on it was it. I will say, Andy, we are making progress on kind of our overall cost optimization or reductions that we started at the beginning of the year, to where we'll be right on plan of what we identified last quarter.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Dudas at Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe you can share a little bit more on PP&S relative to the pipeline as it stands today. You talked a little bit in your prepared remarks about margin improvement in backlog. How does that track as we go through fiscal year 2024? Is the -- are you getting better share on higher-margin projects, maybe early consulting advisory relative to design work in some of these projects? And what areas do you anticipate some of the better revenue and booking growth in the P&PS segment as we move through '24?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Mike, it's a great question. So the short answer is yes. We are starting to see that margin increase according to the profile and the mix. And I'd probably index more towards the water market right now on the mix. Just to give you a statistic, year-on-year growth in our bookings in water have gone up 30%. The other kind of notable one is what we call cities and places, but it's kind of our built environment business, it's been really driven by the Middle East. That year-on-year has been about 40%. And what's kind of positive about both of those -- and I never thought that I'd say this before, but from a cash standpoint and a margin standpoint, we're hitting company-wide type of margin targets in the Middle East, which is a positive. And then the water sector has traditionally been our higher-margin component of our business. So kind of 2 trends there.\nMichael Dudas: Perfect. And what about for bookings and outlook as we move through 2024? Are those the areas you concentrated or are there other areas, given life science, [indiscernible] et cetera?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So moving forward, we're starting to see some pretty exciting developments happening within the life sciences world. That -- as we've talked about it before, it's been red hot for several years. I'd say, the last couple of quarters, we've seen -- it hasn't declined, but it hasn't been accelerating the way it was in the past. Just in the last 6 weeks, we've had some really deep conversations but these are Tier 1 clients we've had forever, that hopefully we'll be reporting some really good news next quarter on those jobs.  I did mention the Lilly job in Germany. That portfolio, specifically around GLP-1 has continued to be strong. Novo just announced the acquisition of Catalent. Those Catalent facilities are going to need to be retrofitted and we were already in the middle of Novo's work. So that's a real positive too.  So I'd look at life sciences getting back. And then the chip manufacturing world has been kind of at the -- as our design work continued from an external semi market standpoint, we're now on the upswing of a new cycle. And so we're seeing more work around the tool OEM. So a lot of the R&D work in order to support these manufacturing facilities on higher-powered chips really driven by AI has been a nice early bookings. So kind of concept work that's happening there.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So Bob, just following up on Mike's question. You mentioned water overall, the Middle East driving your overall People & Places business, which is great. But are there any areas that you are worried about on that side. You mentioned the U.K. for PA, but not really for People & Places. And your backlog was up nicely in the quarter. Does it just continue to sequentially rise from here?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, I'd say the answer to the last part, Andy, is yes. And from a margin -- from a P&L margin perspective, we feel comfortable that our year-on-year increase that I mentioned in the script, is real. And so year-on-year margin increased year-on-year. If there were areas where I'd say soft might be too strong, but if there are areas that we've got a high level of attention on, it is the U.K. We've been able to stay flat in the U.K., which is a positive. But we did have the national infrastructure and construction report just published here, I think it was Friday. And the U.K. government committing to the same level of spend, GBP 775 billion over the course of the next 10 years, with some consideration for inflation. So that's an area that we're continuing to put some attention on to make sure that we continue to grow, but overall positive.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then maybe just on divergent solutions. I know a piece of it is going to go with the RMT, but maybe a little more color on the inventory write-down. Divergence just as you know, like underlying margin is good, but it's kind of been all over the place a little bit over the last several quarters. So what does Divergent look like as you go forward, let's say, post RMT for Jacobs?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So let me just clarify one thing, Andy. The inventory write-down has to do with the Cyber & Intelligence business, and that actually is in the perimeter and will be going. And it's really a part of the separation financials and inventory that we had to disposition. So that's not in the piece that will continue with independent Jacobs. . We see more of it and we're working on this operating model right now. Transportation, water and what we're doing in the built environment around digital enablement, being a strong horizontal cross cutter through now the entirety of the business. So simplifying our reporting as well as taking all the successes that we had within the transportation and water digitization and digital enablement. And integrating them into now what will be independent Jacobs. And so much more to follow on that.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Steven Fisher at UBS. .\nSteven Fisher: Bob, you mentioned that you're on track with the cost expectations you identified at the beginning of the year. So does that mean the $40 million of temporary costs and $275 million of restructuring are still the numbers to keep in mind. And if so, how much of that has been incurred to date? Is that the $17 million plus the $9 million? Or should the $40 million be lower now that you're going to be getting reimbursed for some of that.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. That's a good clarification. So the first part of your question is yes, those $275 million and the $40 million are still very much in play. I'd say on the $40 million, that's not the -- the $9 million was what was incurred in the first quarter. And so the balance would be over the course of the next 3 quarters, and we're indexing probably more in the first half than the second half. So hopefully, that clarifies that. But yes, we're still on track within the numbers that we highlighted in the previous quarter. The $17 million is not included in that. The $17 million is our costs that are with us. They're recoverable. That's why we moved them into the segment.\nClaudia Jaramillo: And Steve, I'll add to the $275 million, we're also on track. And for that, it's a $51 million that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. That's helpful. And then the 14.6% margin for P&PS, is that on the same basis as the 13.7% in Q1? I assume it is. And if so, and then how quickly do we get above that 14.6% to kind of deliver it for the full year given the lighter side in Q1?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Steve, the answer to the first question is yes. And I'd say within the next few quarters.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. So in other words, Q2, we should still be expecting it to be below that? Or...\nRobert Pragada: No, no, no, no. It will sequentially increase over the next few quarters to where Q4 will be above where we were last year.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. I'm just.\nRobert Pragada: For the year. Yes.\nSteven Fisher: For this year?\nRobert Pragada: For this year. This year will be higher than the last year, year-on-year total.\nSteven Fisher: Right. This year, you're guiding to 14.6%, right? Do I have that right?\nRobert Pragada: Better than 14.6%. So last year was 14.6%. And then this year will be better than 14.6% full year.\nSteven Fisher: And if you're 14.7% for the quarter, you got to start being better than 14.6%. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out how quickly we get better than 14.6%. Is that...\nClaudia Jaramillo: It will be a gradual increase.\nRobert Pragada: And we'll see that within our reported financials. That's why that -- Steve, that's why I said a few quarters.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Adam on for Jerry today. Can you talk about -- can you talk a bit more about what drove the 280 plus margin decline in PA Consulting even with revenues higher sequentially? And then what drives visibility on the margin ramp through the balance of the year?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. So what drives -- I'm going to answer the second part first, Adam. The pipeline as well as the -- we call it stock of work in PA, but its backlog, is driving the optimism there as well as the team really does have better arms around the variable cost structure of the entity. Similar to Jacobs, it's a people business, asset-light and services-oriented. The drop was probably driven a little bit by some volatility with our clients in December. And the discretionary spend of -- and it was kind of more in the U.K. business and around what was going on within U.K. government, defense and security as well as the public sector work. And so that was -- that kind of -- if it stops on a dime, we can't make those variable cost actions. And so we ended up seeing that in the quarter. That has since kind of returned and then we're managing our variable costs ahead of it, similar to what we did in mid last year.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then on the top line, solid growth this quarter, high-single digits, but the comps get a little harder from here. How are you thinking about the organic growth outlook in the balance of the year amid some of the things going on in the U.K. market?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. I think we're still in that kind of mid-single digits to mid-high singles. [indiscernible] for 3 years. 3 years has been double-digit growth. And so we're still growing. I think we're probably kind of in that mid-single-digit growth now.\nOperator: And next, we'll move to Chad Dillard at Bernstein.\nCharles Dillard: So I wanted to spend a little more time on just like what you're seeing from a booking standpoint, in People & Places. So first place is just like on the semiconductor side. So it sounds like there's a number of grants to be announced by the U.S. in March. To what extent do you think that could potentially unlock with more activity from a design standpoint. And then just like what are you seeing from like a domestic versus international perspective, just for semi design?\nRobert Pragada: Yes. So let me answer the first one, Chad, just writing some notes on. On the grants that are coming out, I would probably -- similar to what I said to Mike Dudas is that those grants are being utilized predominantly in the R&D side, right? Because these larger facilities need to get to full production and so the larger IDM or the integrated device manufacturers are probably thinking more about the semiconductor buy cycle, right, and timing their output or the start-up of those large plants. So those grants then go to where technology advancements are happening, and that's happening at the tool OEMs. And so actually those -- that's kind of driving our bookings right now as well, those tool OEMs. The great thing here about Jacobs is we're inside the technology of the tool and understand the facility requirements for them. So we got a nice position there, and that's what's kind of driving the bookings within the semi piece.  Right now, I'd say that predominantly, it's domestic. We are seeing some activity in Europe around the EU Chips Act. But really, the business is probably more indexed towards the domestic piece. I would say that the country that we're really watching and are in the midst and was just there in December is the growth of foreign direct investment in India.  And as chip manufacturing potentially pivots from China in India, so into India. And so we're kind of on the front end of that as well, both large-scale Indian clients as well as foreign companies that are non-Indian clients coming into India.\nCharles Dillard: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just going back to the cost reallocation from [indiscernible] allocated to People & Places. Just wanted to get a sense for like how long it will take before you actually can hit the P&L. Do you have to go through like a full bid cycle. So in other words, do you have to like fully turn over the backlog before you see those benefits?\nRobert Pragada: No, it's gradual. It's gradual. So those [indiscernible] starts the next quarter, I'd say from a full kind of actualization of those costs that goes in, it's about a 12 to 24-month cycle. But just to reiterate, Chad, we're reiterating our year-on-year margin improvement even with the gradual recoverability of that overhead.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sabahat Khan at RBC.\nSabahat Khan: Just a follow-up on the PA conversation earlier. Obviously, we see the bookings number. But I guess, as you're talking to your clients in that space, are you seeing a bit of a pipeline build up there. That business is obviously a bit more macro impacted than the P&PS business but just wondering where sort of the conversations are that aren't in the backlog right now for that business line?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. I'd say that, so the 2 areas within PA that we're getting 1 actually is kind of ubiquitous in today's world as well as within the PA world. And then I'll go to an end market sector, is the use of AI and AI enablement in our clients' business as a driver of business transformation. And so to kind of toggle here, it's good for PA, it's good for Jacobs, in that the AI enablement is the start of the conversation. I think some clients now this kind of goes to how quickly does that get into an engagement, get into backlog, we realize in P&L. That's kind of where we are right now as far as where we are in the cycle. So AI is a big driver. But the timing and speed of how our clients are embracing it is driving some of the booking cycle.  The second from an end market standpoint is Life Sciences. And so PA has been able to take not just AI, but other knowledge and look at the transformation of the whole clinical study program, especially as that's kind of gotten more patient-centric with different types of therapies for each patient. PA has rightly been right in the middle of all of that. And so that kind of got a tail on it as well.  And then the last one that is really kind of starting to develop in our pipeline at PA is around the use of AI in early-stage drug discovery piece, and it's real, real early stage. I mean clearly, the Tier 1s are way out ahead. But PA does it from more of a standpoint of how that's going to transform kind of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 clients. So some good stuff. I'd say this the timing right now of how quickly those get embraced while clients are thinking about their own business is causing some of that near-term softness.\nSabahat Khan: Great. And then I guess on the P&PS side, there's been some discussion about when some of the larger funding packages really got going. But -- maybe if you could provide a little bit of color around your top line guidance for P&PS. And what assumption is in there from kind of contribution from the IIJA or the IRA. And -- or how much of it is from kind of just base level business and how maybe the government funding is tracking relative to initial expectations?\nRobert Pragada: Sure. Yes, I'd say that, that guidance that we've been pretty true to and I kind of -- I mentioned a statistic there that 6% to 9% or mid- to high-single-digit growth and for the last 5 quarters, we've been right there on the high end of that range is where we're seeing the IIJA component of that is we just saw some statistics that we're -- from a time line standpoint, halfway through, but on some of the larger rail and highway specifically, we're 25% outlaid -- 15% obligated and 25% outlaid on the actual money. So it hasn't been a big piece of the growth. But the positive news is that it looks like that 5-year cycle is definitely going to get extended.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bert Subin at Stifel.\nBert Subin: Bob, just to follow up on that point. If we look beyond '24 and maybe into '25 and past that, it sounds like your visibility is generally improving not just in advanced facilities but in large parts of P&PS. As you think about potentially toggling you're above what your medium-term view is for the segment, what would drive that? Is that more a function of winning some specific larger projects? Or is it the flow of funding under some of these programs?\nRobert Pragada: Yes, Bert. And are you saying independent of advanced facilities to the other kind of non-advanced facility sectors or to inclusive of.\nBert Subin: No. I think inclusive of, I guess, from what you were saying, Bob, in your earlier comments, it sounds like you feel like you're more on that upslope and you're seeing sort of the path of some of that CapEx will be beneficial for you. So including that and thinking about what you just mentioned about IIJA and some of the other programs, it seems like your visibility is quite good. If you were to say, several years from now, look at you and you were growing at 9% or faster than your 6% to 9% growth range. I'm just curious if that's more a function of winning some of those larger projects that are out there? Or is it just the funding needs to flow sort of on time?\nRobert Pragada: I would say it's probably more of winning those projects in the market that I would index towards is water. The pipeline growth in water, and I mentioned it last quarter, Bert, and it actually has continued this quarter. It's not as big as transportation, but if transportation continues at the same kind of clip even with the IIJA comment, but water continues at the rate that it is right now, and we're having this conversation 6 to 8 quarters from now, water and then water and environmental for those 2 are kind of interdependent on each other. I'd say, is the one where we're seeing not only the projects being announced but the funding be applied, and a lot of that is being driven around water scarcity.  And look at what's going on in California right now, it's either we got too much and we got to figure out where to put it or we don't have enough and we got to figure out how to find it and treat it. And so I'm oversimplifying, but that's probably what I'd say.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Maybe just a cost side question. If we look at that bridge that you guys put in the deck going from 10.8% to 13.8%, can you just help us think through how much of that is cost cutting related and how much of that is just improved mix? Sounds like you're pretty bullish on the margin opportunity in P&PS. So is that a function of just you're getting better projects? Or is it more cost cutting? Or is it sort of 50-50?\nRobert Pragada: I'd say it's balanced. Probably 50-50. There's a 50% mix, but 50% is a leaner organization with now and we've started as of Q1, a level of recoverability and optimization of our cost structure rather than the straight variability of, if you're busy, you spend and if you're not, you cut, right? We want to get more of in the steady state.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks.\nRobert Pragada: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. A lot of exciting things happening in the business right now, and we look forward to giving you further updates in quarters to come.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Claudia Jaramillo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which came in above our expectations. Our results illustrate our ability to deliver on our long-standing financial objectives, while at the same time, generating strong free cash flow and returning a significant portion of our cash to shareholders.  So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. First quarter gross revenue grew 9.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $204 million for the quarter and included $51 million of amortization for acquired intangibles and $60 million of other transaction, separation related restructuring and other costs. This includes $51 million associated with the separation of CMS. Our adjusted operating margin was 9.8%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reported segment review.  GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.37 per share. And included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.37 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.02, up 28% year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS included a $0.49 benefit related to a discrete tax item and a $0.09 headwind related to the noncash inventory write-down.  Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $328 million and was down 3.1% year-over-year, representing 10% of our adjusted net working capital. Excluding the inventory write-down, adjusted EBITDA would be roughly flat year-over-year. The effective tax rate of 4.2% benefited from $61.6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the permanent reinvestment of capital gains associated with an overseas subsidiary. This tax benefit was incorporated in our annual guidance and we continue to forecast the 22% annual effective tax rate to fiscal year 2024.  We will no longer be adjusting our non-GAAP EPS to align with our full year effective tax rate expectations. With the entirety of the deferred tax benefit in Q1, we now expect quarterly effective tax rate to approximate 26% to 27% for each quarter of the remainder of the fiscal year.  Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1.12x, with our gross profit in backlog increasing 6.1% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our [indiscernible] in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8.  Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q1 adjusted net revenue was up 8.4% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was down slightly, resulting in adjusted operating margins of 13.7%. However, excluding the impact of cost allocation changes previously mentioned, adjusted operating profit would have resulted in approximately 7% year-over-year growth. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business and anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.  Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q1 revenue increased 5% year-over-year with backlog up 9%, continuing a consistent trend of high-single-digit growth over multiple quarters. We also continue to find avenues through operational improvement with CMS operating margins rising by 63 basis points year-over-year.  Shifting to Divergent Solutions. In Q1, our adjusted net revenue increased by 4.7% year-over-year. Underlying execution was strong. Adjusted operating profit was $8 million, including the $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding the one-off write-down, performance was above expectations.  Now let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q1 saw an 8.5% year-over-year revenue increase. PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline. However, the U.K.'s ongoing election cycle introduces macro risks that we are closely monitoring. We remain confident in our ability to navigate these factors by managing variable costs and are targeting approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year. In total, it was a strong quarter for each of our segments from an execution standpoint.  Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q1. This quarter's cost excluded previously mentioned costs that are now being allocated to the P&PS segment. As we continue to enhance operational efficiencies and optimize our operating model, we expect this line item to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually post debt pressure.  Turning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted another quarter of strong cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. As Bob mentioned, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $401 million. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings.  Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent returns to our shareholders. We still have $775 million remaining under last year's repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders in aligning with our overarching goal of compounding free cash flow per share.  We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.14 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion. Our Q1 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.2x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q1, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.1%.  Finally, with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized an 11.5% increase to $0.29 per quarter, and our quarterly dividend will be paid on March 22. With this, we have increased our dividends each year since 2018, driving a nearly 12% dividend CAGR over that period.  Now I will turn it back to Bob. And Steve, I'll add to the $275 million, we're also on track. And for that, it's a $51 million that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. It will be a gradual increase."

            "name": "Robert Pragada",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure and accelerating profitable growth and margin expansion across our lines of business. Our team continues to demonstrate great resilience and dedication as we delivered better-than-expected underlying results in Q1, while also working to the added task of standing up 2 independent companies. At the corporate level, we are diligently working to create a leaner operating model that aligns Jacobs' position as a global leader in delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions to our clients. And allowing us to benefit fully from the broad-based strength that we see in global infrastructure and sustainability investments.  We are confident that our actions we are taking are providing the foundation for multiyear improvement in profitability and margins, and we look forward to sharing more detail in the quarters to come.  Turning to Slide 4. I want to provide a brief update on a few key milestones related to the spin-off and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions in Cyber and Intelligence businesses with momentum. We continue to progress towards closing of the transaction in the second half of fiscal year 2024, consistent with our previous expectations. Together with momentum, we are making progress on preparing our Form 10 and private letter ruling request in keeping with the established time line of the transaction.  Additionally, we are progressing antitrust filings and regulatory approvals. Upon the public filing of the Form 10, we aim to offer more comprehensive information and look forward to introducing the combined leadership team to our investors and analysts later this spring.  I would also likely -- like to briefly touch on the cost optimization plan that we outlined last quarter. Our transformation to a less vulnerable and higher-value, higher-margin portfolio is well underway. We continue to find new ways to streamline our operating model. And while it is too early to positively revise our targets, we are increasingly confident in our ability to enhance our long-term profitability. As we progress towards separation and optimizing our corporate cost structure, we now are able to better align costs to the applicable business units.  As a result, we have made the decision to shift some corporate unallocated costs into the current P&PS segment, which will allow for greater long-term recovery of our corporate overhead. While this has the effect of temporarily weighing on our segment operating margins, this has no impact on our bottom line today. Rather, this will boost corporate profitability in the long run as we gradually recover cost from public sector clients. Providing upside beyond the initial 13.8% adjusted EBITDA margin target set for stand-alone Jacobs, post separation that we shared last quarter. This adds to our conviction that our transformation will drive multiyear value creation.  Turning to Slide 5. In Q1, I'm pleased to report a strong first quarter revenue driven by 9.5% gross and 7.9% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 5% year-over-year, and gross margin in backlog improved 29 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our businesses can continue their profitable growth trends.  This quarter's results include a onetime noncash $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding this item, adjusted operating profit would have increased versus the prior year period. We saw a continuation of strong organic growth in P&PS with 8.4% adjusted net revenue growth. We had a Q1 operating cash flow of $418 million, up 38% year-over-year. Strong cash conversion is a hallmark of our asset-light business model and remain robust in Q1 with $401 million in free cash flow, and we expect to generate greater than 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024. The ultimate measure of our ability to create value is long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and that will continue to be our North Star.  Turning to Slide 6. Our People & Places line of business generated strong top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 8.4% year-over-year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 6% organic growth. We continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth as demonstrated by gross profit and backlog increasing 7% year-over-year.  Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic growth of mid- to high-single digits in FY '24. We anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.  The water market remains to be a pacesetter within the company. In particular, water scarcity continues to trend across the globe, affecting billions of people. Decades of increasing population growth and agricultural demand have significantly depleted the quantity and quality of water resources. Jacobs is a leader in developing solutions to address water scarcity, including water reuse, groundwater management and desalinization.  In the Americas, California and Colorado have recently adopted regulations for direct potable reuse. And Arizona is making positive strides towards adopting similar regulations. Notably, the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, is currently building a new semiconductor facility in Arizona. We've been selected for the first phase of the design and project delivery of the campus' industrial reclaimed water plant. In addition, multiple states in the U.S. are developing regional water supply plants to balance water availability and economic growth. As an example of such work, we were awarded a $191 million project in St. Johns County, Florida for the design and project delivery of a water reclamation facility.  This facility will treat 3.25 million gallons of water daily for beneficial reuse with 13 miles of transitioning pipelines to deliver reclaimed water for residential irrigation.  In transportation, we have a long-term relationship with Brightline West and have been awarded the design of the 218-mile high-speed rail linking Las Vegas to Southern California. Brightline West through a partnership with Nevada successfully secured $3 billion in grants from the Federal Railroad Administration as part of the IIJA funding.  In Life Sciences, we're supporting Lilly, with permitting and conceptual design for their injectable manufacturing facility in Alzey, Germany, to support an increased demand for their medicines, including their diabetes and obesity portfolio.  We continue to secure additional large engagements in the Middle East. For example, we've been appointed to provide preliminary and detail design and supervision services for utility and road infrastructure, including major road upgrades for Wadi Safar and Diriyah Gate 2 in Saudi Arabia.  In CMS, we performed very well in Q1, continuing the profitability trend demonstrated in FY '23. CMS' Q1 revenue was up 5% over year and operating profit increased 14% behind 63 basis points of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remains strong with major award prospects in FY '24 and a light recompete schedule. The CMS team is executing well and has great momentum as they prepare to be an independent company.  PA Consulting continues to take share as demonstrated by an 8.5% revenue growth in what continues to be a choppy macro environment, particularly in the U.K. Margins were light due to some softness in December. However, we continue to expect approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year and have confidence in our ability to manage variable costs to achieve that goal.  Together with PA, we celebrated new wins with the office of gas and electricity markets in the U.K. for program management services and regulatory practices that will advance the safe and secure supply of hydrogen.  Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a solid quarter with 5% adjusted net revenue growth. Profits were impacted by an approximately $15 million onetime in connection with the merger. Underlying performance in the business was strong and excluded this write-down. Adjusted operating margins would have been approximately 700 basis points higher and exceeded our expectations for the quarter.  In summary, we remain well positioned to grow while serving our clients with excellence and delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions for a more connected and sustainable world. And we continue generating strong free cash flow conversion, which will enable us to return capital to shareholders as we chart our new path forward as 2 independent companies.  Now I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail. Thank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to be energized as interest in our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains robust as clients engage Jacobs to solve their most complex challenges. Internally, we remain focused on execution and continuing to deliver against our operational and financial objectives. We reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.60 billion, with adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing 9% and 10% growth at midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.02 and as Claudia shared, a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of this fiscal year.  Though we expect a heavier than normal cost structure until separation, particularly in [indiscernible], we anticipate accelerating EPS growth in the second half of the fiscal year.  In closing, we've maintained focus on standing up both independent Jacobs and CMS for success while streamlining and optimizing our operating model and positioning both companies for long-term value creation.  Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Yes, Andy, it's a great question. It's actually a nice lead-in. So your assessment of that recoverability is correct. And if you just kind of just moment -- for a moment, kind of pre planning for the separation and outpost. Pre, we had a lot of shared costs. And so the direct applicability through the segment was not as clear. And since we started this, we had a great opportunity to now have direct line of sight to where these are being applied. Hit it right in the beginning of the audit cycle, the government audit cycle in Q1 and now have the full year of applying those costs.  So that's -- that's correct. Now on the full year amount, it would be the $17 million that we identified this year -- I'm sorry, this quarter multiplied by 4. But remember, over each quarter that goes down because of the recoverability effect. Did that make sense? That's correct. No. No, the $9 million of transition costs took it to $59 million and then the $17 million that we were able to, from a positive standpoint, move into P&PS and get recoverability on it was it. I will say, Andy, we are making progress on kind of our overall cost optimization or reductions that we started at the beginning of the year, to where we'll be right on plan of what we identified last quarter. Yes. Mike, it's a great question. So the short answer is yes. We are starting to see that margin increase according to the profile and the mix. And I'd probably index more towards the water market right now on the mix. Just to give you a statistic, year-on-year growth in our bookings in water have gone up 30%. The other kind of notable one is what we call cities and places, but it's kind of our built environment business, it's been really driven by the Middle East. That year-on-year has been about 40%. And what's kind of positive about both of those -- and I never thought that I'd say this before, but from a cash standpoint and a margin standpoint, we're hitting company-wide type of margin targets in the Middle East, which is a positive. And then the water sector has traditionally been our higher-margin component of our business. So kind of 2 trends there. Yes. So moving forward, we're starting to see some pretty exciting developments happening within the life sciences world. That -- as we've talked about it before, it's been red hot for several years. I'd say, the last couple of quarters, we've seen -- it hasn't declined, but it hasn't been accelerating the way it was in the past. Just in the last 6 weeks, we've had some really deep conversations but these are Tier 1 clients we've had forever, that hopefully we'll be reporting some really good news next quarter on those jobs.  I did mention the Lilly job in Germany. That portfolio, specifically around GLP-1 has continued to be strong. Novo just announced the acquisition of Catalent. Those Catalent facilities are going to need to be retrofitted and we were already in the middle of Novo's work. So that's a real positive too.  So I'd look at life sciences getting back. And then the chip manufacturing world has been kind of at the -- as our design work continued from an external semi market standpoint, we're now on the upswing of a new cycle. And so we're seeing more work around the tool OEM. So a lot of the R&D work in order to support these manufacturing facilities on higher-powered chips really driven by AI has been a nice early bookings. So kind of concept work that's happening there. Yes, I'd say the answer to the last part, Andy, is yes. And from a margin -- from a P&L margin perspective, we feel comfortable that our year-on-year increase that I mentioned in the script, is real. And so year-on-year margin increased year-on-year. If there were areas where I'd say soft might be too strong, but if there are areas that we've got a high level of attention on, it is the U.K. We've been able to stay flat in the U.K., which is a positive. But we did have the national infrastructure and construction report just published here, I think it was Friday. And the U.K. government committing to the same level of spend, GBP 775 billion over the course of the next 10 years, with some consideration for inflation. So that's an area that we're continuing to put some attention on to make sure that we continue to grow, but overall positive. Yes. So let me just clarify one thing, Andy. The inventory write-down has to do with the Cyber & Intelligence business, and that actually is in the perimeter and will be going. And it's really a part of the separation financials and inventory that we had to disposition. So that's not in the piece that will continue with independent Jacobs. . We see more of it and we're working on this operating model right now. Transportation, water and what we're doing in the built environment around digital enablement, being a strong horizontal cross cutter through now the entirety of the business. So simplifying our reporting as well as taking all the successes that we had within the transportation and water digitization and digital enablement. And integrating them into now what will be independent Jacobs. And so much more to follow on that. Yes. Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. That's a good clarification. So the first part of your question is yes, those $275 million and the $40 million are still very much in play. I'd say on the $40 million, that's not the -- the $9 million was what was incurred in the first quarter. And so the balance would be over the course of the next 3 quarters, and we're indexing probably more in the first half than the second half. So hopefully, that clarifies that. But yes, we're still on track within the numbers that we highlighted in the previous quarter. The $17 million is not included in that. The $17 million is our costs that are with us. They're recoverable. That's why we moved them into the segment. Yes. Steve, the answer to the first question is yes. And I'd say within the next few quarters. No, no, no, no. It will sequentially increase over the next few quarters to where Q4 will be above where we were last year. For the year. Yes. For this year. This year will be higher than the last year, year-on-year total. Better than 14.6%. So last year was 14.6%. And then this year will be better than 14.6% full year. And we'll see that within our reported financials. That's why that -- Steve, that's why I said a few quarters. Sure. So what drives -- I'm going to answer the second part first, Adam. The pipeline as well as the -- we call it stock of work in PA, but its backlog, is driving the optimism there as well as the team really does have better arms around the variable cost structure of the entity. Similar to Jacobs, it's a people business, asset-light and services-oriented. The drop was probably driven a little bit by some volatility with our clients in December. And the discretionary spend of -- and it was kind of more in the U.K. business and around what was going on within U.K. government, defense and security as well as the public sector work. And so that was -- that kind of -- if it stops on a dime, we can't make those variable cost actions. And so we ended up seeing that in the quarter. That has since kind of returned and then we're managing our variable costs ahead of it, similar to what we did in mid last year. Yes. I think we're still in that kind of mid-single digits to mid-high singles. [indiscernible] for 3 years. 3 years has been double-digit growth. And so we're still growing. I think we're probably kind of in that mid-single-digit growth now. Yes. So let me answer the first one, Chad, just writing some notes on. On the grants that are coming out, I would probably -- similar to what I said to Mike Dudas is that those grants are being utilized predominantly in the R&D side, right? Because these larger facilities need to get to full production and so the larger IDM or the integrated device manufacturers are probably thinking more about the semiconductor buy cycle, right, and timing their output or the start-up of those large plants. So those grants then go to where technology advancements are happening, and that's happening at the tool OEMs. And so actually those -- that's kind of driving our bookings right now as well, those tool OEMs. The great thing here about Jacobs is we're inside the technology of the tool and understand the facility requirements for them. So we got a nice position there, and that's what's kind of driving the bookings within the semi piece.  Right now, I'd say that predominantly, it's domestic. We are seeing some activity in Europe around the EU Chips Act. But really, the business is probably more indexed towards the domestic piece. I would say that the country that we're really watching and are in the midst and was just there in December is the growth of foreign direct investment in India.  And as chip manufacturing potentially pivots from China in India, so into India. And so we're kind of on the front end of that as well, both large-scale Indian clients as well as foreign companies that are non-Indian clients coming into India. No, it's gradual. It's gradual. So those [indiscernible] starts the next quarter, I'd say from a full kind of actualization of those costs that goes in, it's about a 12 to 24-month cycle. But just to reiterate, Chad, we're reiterating our year-on-year margin improvement even with the gradual recoverability of that overhead. Sure. I'd say that, so the 2 areas within PA that we're getting 1 actually is kind of ubiquitous in today's world as well as within the PA world. And then I'll go to an end market sector, is the use of AI and AI enablement in our clients' business as a driver of business transformation. And so to kind of toggle here, it's good for PA, it's good for Jacobs, in that the AI enablement is the start of the conversation. I think some clients now this kind of goes to how quickly does that get into an engagement, get into backlog, we realize in P&L. That's kind of where we are right now as far as where we are in the cycle. So AI is a big driver. But the timing and speed of how our clients are embracing it is driving some of the booking cycle.  The second from an end market standpoint is Life Sciences. And so PA has been able to take not just AI, but other knowledge and look at the transformation of the whole clinical study program, especially as that's kind of gotten more patient-centric with different types of therapies for each patient. PA has rightly been right in the middle of all of that. And so that kind of got a tail on it as well.  And then the last one that is really kind of starting to develop in our pipeline at PA is around the use of AI in early-stage drug discovery piece, and it's real, real early stage. I mean clearly, the Tier 1s are way out ahead. But PA does it from more of a standpoint of how that's going to transform kind of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 clients. So some good stuff. I'd say this the timing right now of how quickly those get embraced while clients are thinking about their own business is causing some of that near-term softness. Sure. Yes, I'd say that, that guidance that we've been pretty true to and I kind of -- I mentioned a statistic there that 6% to 9% or mid- to high-single-digit growth and for the last 5 quarters, we've been right there on the high end of that range is where we're seeing the IIJA component of that is we just saw some statistics that we're -- from a time line standpoint, halfway through, but on some of the larger rail and highway specifically, we're 25% outlaid -- 15% obligated and 25% outlaid on the actual money. So it hasn't been a big piece of the growth. But the positive news is that it looks like that 5-year cycle is definitely going to get extended. Yes, Bert. And are you saying independent of advanced facilities to the other kind of non-advanced facility sectors or to inclusive of. I would say it's probably more of winning those projects in the market that I would index towards is water. The pipeline growth in water, and I mentioned it last quarter, Bert, and it actually has continued this quarter. It's not as big as transportation, but if transportation continues at the same kind of clip even with the IIJA comment, but water continues at the rate that it is right now, and we're having this conversation 6 to 8 quarters from now, water and then water and environmental for those 2 are kind of interdependent on each other. I'd say, is the one where we're seeing not only the projects being announced but the funding be applied, and a lot of that is being driven around water scarcity.  And look at what's going on in California right now, it's either we got too much and we got to figure out where to put it or we don't have enough and we got to figure out how to find it and treat it. And so I'm oversimplifying, but that's probably what I'd say. I'd say it's balanced. Probably 50-50. There's a 50% mix, but 50% is a leaner organization with now and we've started as of Q1, a level of recoverability and optimization of our cost structure rather than the straight variability of, if you're busy, you spend and if you're not, you cut, right? We want to get more of in the steady state. Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. A lot of exciting things happening in the business right now, and we look forward to giving you further updates in quarters to come."
