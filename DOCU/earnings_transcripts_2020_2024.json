I'd now like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks Anne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 earnings call. We have a lot to share with you today. We'll cover our performance for the quarter as well as the entire fiscal year. We'll talk in more detail about our recently announced intention to acquire Seal Software. And we'll look ahead to our focus areas for fiscal 2021. But before we get to that, I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge the evolving situation with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Over the past few weeks, our team has been meeting daily to monitor the ongoing developments. We've taken several steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and their families as well as our customers and partners. Actions we've taken include; transforming our annual North America Customer Conference Momentum into a virtual live stream event held last week; and our decision to move our global workforce to an entirely remote environment as of the end of this week. We will continue to monitor the situation and as we learn more, we'll update our plans accordingly. With that said, let's move on to our business performance over our second year as a public company. It was just 12 months ago that we introduced the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. Our suite of applications and integrations that help organizations automate the entire agreement process that is; preparing, signing, acting on and managing those agreements. We see agreements increasingly integrated with the cloud software suites like sales, service, marketing, HR and finance. Our belief is that organizations will need an Agreement Cloud to act as a platform of record for agreements and agreement processes, which will be connected to the other clouds. For example, integrating with the HR system for offer letters or the CRM system for sales contracts. As we have said, we believe this represents the next big cloud opportunity. Over the past fiscal year, we have broadened our product and service offerings to cover every stage of the agreement process. And of the five new products that we shipped in fiscal 2020, I'd especially like to call out DocuSign CLM. Launched in November last year this builds on our acquisition of SpringCM. And it was just named by Gartner as a leader in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for contract life cycle management. We are very proud of this recognition. The positive impact of all this work can be seen in our financial results, a few of which I want to share with you. Now for Q4, DocuSign's revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $275 million and billings grew by 40% year-over-year to $367 million. We were again profitable on a non-GAAP basis and we continue to generate positive cash flow. Our total customer count climbed to approximately 589,000 worldwide and our dollar net retention rate came in at 117%. For the full fiscal year, our revenue grew 39% to $974 million and our billings grew 38% to $1.1 billion. I am incredibly proud of the entire DocuSign team for this collective effort. But of course we're not going to stop there. As we continue to define and grow the Agreement Cloud category, we know that contract analytics and artificial intelligence will play an increasingly important role. This technology can rapidly search large collections of agreements by legal concept rather than just by keywords. It can automatically extract, analyze and compare contract terms and it can even identify areas of risk and business opportunity for our customers. So we couldn't be more excited to be acquiring the pioneer in this space Seal Software. As many of you know we formed a partnership with Seal about two years ago where we began reselling its flagship offering as DocuSign Intelligent Insights. And we also made a strategic $15 million investment in the company in March of last year. Having seen Seal's technology and people at work with our customers, as well as in the broader marketplace, we wanted to bring them fully aboard into DocuSign. To give you a little more color let me share a few customer examples. One large international information services company reduced the time they spent on legal reviews by 75%. And a global financial services company automated the analysis of more than 2.5 million contractual data points across its supplier agreement. And an aviation company was able to review more than 25,000 agreements in just a few business days, something that could have taken months if done in the traditional manual fashion. Once this acquisition closes, we will continue selling Seal's flagship contract analytics product. We'll also be able to integrate Seal's technology across the entire Agreement Cloud. We'll start with CLM given the immediate market opportunity for AI to enhance workflows there. And over time we expect to apply Seal's AI technology across a broad range of our existing and new products. Now these developments will complement and extend our other work in AI, some of which we showed at our Momentum conference last week. For example, we demoed auto-tagging. It's a new feature in eSignature. It uses AI to automatically place the tags for signatures, dates and other fields. Normally this is something that needs to be done manually when preparing a document for signature. With auto-tagging it can happen automatically and immediately and it is a huge wow factor for our users. We also demoed a product under development called Agreement Analyzer. It uses Seal's AI to analyze inbound agreements identifying areas of risk and triggering actions based on the content of its various clauses. So, we believe this whole area of AI meets agreements is incredibly exciting. While nascent today it represents a key greenfield opportunity for the future as well as a deepening of our competitive moat. We will keep you updated once the Seal acquisition closes in our second quarter. For the last part of my comments today, I want to look to the future and how we are thinking about scaling our business. Based on our fiscal 2020 results, we are on the cusp of joining an elite group of SaaS companies that have crossed the $1 billion revenue threshold. This is a major milestone, but it's also just a stepping stone to the exciting future that lies ahead. Our first $1 billion was built largely on our leadership in eSignature. The next $1 billion will continue the eSignature expansion but also be boosted by substantially broader opportunities for the rest of the Agreement Cloud. To make that happen and to ensure we operate at the intersection of the world's business and agreement processes, we'll focus on three key strategic priorities. One, continue executing on our Agreement Cloud vision and strategy which fiscal 2020 customer demand has shown is working well. Two, live and breed customer success around the world in everything that we do. As part of that we'll also continue to leverage our amazing partner network both our 350 ISV partners and our growing SI partners that are building Agreement Cloud practices to drive our joint customer success. And three, we ensure DocuSign remains a top place to work so that we can attract and retain the talent that can drive our scale to the next level. And to that point, I wanted to share that we recently appointed Rob Giglio as our new Chief Marketing Officer; and Eric Darwin as our Head of Corporate Development. Both will be reporting to our COO, Scott Olrich. Rob comes to us from Adobe, where he helped to architect the growth strategy for the company's self-service cloud business and oversaw significant international expansion. Eric joins us from LinkedIn where he led the corporate development team there. In addition you may recall that we named Emily Heath as our Chief Trust and Security Officer in October of last year. Emily was formerly the CISO at United Airlines and we are already benefiting from our considerable experience. So, that's it for my section of today's call. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we made as a company in fiscal 2020 and I'm excited about the Agreement Cloud's prospects to transform agreements and agreement processes around the world in fiscal 2021 and beyond. So, with that I'd like to hand it over to Mike for a deeper look at our Q4 and our fiscal year financials. Mike?\nMike Sheridan: Thanks Dan and good afternoon everyone. As Dan mentioned, DocuSign had a very successful fiscal 2020 in which we saw continued strong growth in our core eSignature offerings and increasing interest in upsells among our customers for our broader Agreement Cloud suite. For the fourth quarter, total revenue reached $275 million and subscription revenue reached $258 million, both representing a 38% increase year-over-year. For the full year, total revenue increased 39% to $974 million and subscription revenue increased 38% to $918 million. International revenue continued to grow over 40% year-over-year to $49 million in the quarter and $171 million for the year. Fourth quarter billings rose 40% year-over-year to $367 million and billings for the full year increased 38% to $1.1 billion. We added almost 27,000 new customers in the quarter including nearly 6,000 direct customers. This represents a 33% year-over-year increase in our commercial and enterprise installed base and brings our fiscal 2020 total customers to approximately 589,000 of which about 75,000 are direct customers. We had another strong quarter of upsells into our installed base led by our North American business. This quarter our dollar net retention was 117%. Customers with ACV is greater than $300,000 grew 41% year-over-year to a total of 437 customers. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 79% compared with 78% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was also 79% compared with 80% in fiscal 2019. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 84% compared with 85% a year ago. For the full year, subscription gross margin was also 84% compared with 86% in fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $196 million or 71% of total revenue compared with $149 million or 75% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, operating expenses were $720 million or 74% of revenue compared with $544 million or 78% of revenue in fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP operating profit for Q4 was $21 million or an 8% operating margin compared with $7 million or a 4% operating margin last year. For the full year, operating margin was 5% up from 2% in fiscal 2019 as we continue to make progress on improving our operating leverage. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $22 million compared with $10 million last year. For the full year, net income was $59 million, up from $18 million in fiscal 2019. We ended the year with 3,909 employees a year-over-year increase of 29%. Operating cash flow increased 33% year-over-year to $46 million in the fourth quarter compared to $34 million in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow was $16 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the prior year. This decrease relates to our capital investments to complete the build-out of our Dublin office in Q4 and continued work on our dedicated federal data center which we expect to complete in the first half of fiscal 2021. For the full year, operating cash flow increased 52% year-over-year to $116 million compared to $76 million a year ago, while free cash flow was $44 million compared to $46 million in fiscal 2019. Turning to our guidance, as you know, we recently announced our intent to acquire Seal Software. We expect this acquisition to close in fiscal Q2. The guidance ranges I'm about to discuss do not include contributions from Seal other than topline contributions we expect to generate from our existing partnership with Seal. We will update our guidance to include contributions from Seal after the acquisition closes. Seal is significantly smaller than DocuSign, so the impact of including Seal will not be significant to our top or bottom-line. In terms of topline guidance, we expect subscription revenue of $266 million to $270 million in Q1 and $1.21 billion to $1.214 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect total revenue of $280 million to $284 million in Q1 and $1.272 billion to $1.276 billion for fiscal 2021. I have separately guided subscription and total revenues because we anticipate different growth rates in these components of revenue. Specifically, we believe that we will be successful in engaging system integrators to take on more of our professional services engagements in fiscal 2021 as we have more projects that involve multiple products from our Agreement Cloud. This positive development will reduce the year-over-year growth rate in our professional service and other revenue. For the remainder of our guidance, we anticipate billings of $279 million to $289 million in Q1 and $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q1 and fiscal 2021. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 47% to 49% of revenues in Q1 and fiscal 2021. R&D in the range of 13% to 15% of revenue for Q1 and fiscal 2021. And finally, G&A in the range of 9% to 11% of revenue for Q1 and fiscal 2021. For the first quarter, we expect $2 million to $3 million of non-GAAP interest and other non-operating income. And for fiscal 2021, we expect non-GAAP interest and other -- and non-operating income of $8 million to $12 million. We expect a tax provision of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million for Q1 and $6 million to $10 million for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 195 million to 200 million shares for Q1 and fiscal 2021. Overall, fiscal 2020 was another outstanding year for DocuSign. As we continue to broaden our Agreement Cloud, we are excited at the interest we are seeing from our customers and partners as we begin fiscal 2021. Thanks for joining us today. And now we will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. I wonder if maybe you can give us a little color as to what industries maybe you're seeing increased strength as we're seeing a lot more remote working remote sales engagements maybe some areas that maybe you're seeing some weakness. And especially, what's happening in the real estate market given what we're seeing with refinance volumes?\nDan Springer: Yes. So I think the answer is our strength is a lot in our traditional places. Financial services in particular has continued to be strong for us. We see telecom with good strength as well. From your real estate question, we haven't seen anything different. I know lower interest rates might start to change activity there. But at this point in time, we haven't seen anything. And keep in mind, when we talk about real estate, it's often much more focused on volume on the transactions of buying and selling homes versus refinancing. So I wouldn't think a dramatically different interest rate environment from refinancing would change it. I suppose it could spur additional new purchases and sales and that would have some lift, but in general, we haven't seen any noticeable change at this point.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. And then one follow-up on the acquisition of Seal. What portion of your existing installed base would you think are just the natural targets for upsell the solution that perhaps have not already adopted?\nDan Springer: Well I think you have to look at two pieces. You have to look at what we've been doing with Agreement Analyzer think about some of the traditional Seal software pieces and that's going to have a heavier focus towards our enterprise and our larger commercial customers. But as I mentioned on the call, we really think there's an opportunity to take the AI technology here and spread that across our entire offering and we would be really excited to make that available to more and more smaller customers as well. And particularly this idea taking the product that was coded into Seal now, which allows people to analyze incoming agreements that I referred to. That I think is going to be an opportunity that would be used for small businesses all the way up to enterprises. So we think it's going to be broadly based, but different aspects of it are going to be appropriate for different customer segments.\nSterling Auty: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much. And congrats on a really nice end of the year. Just two quick ones. Mike, sorry if I missed this in your prepared commentary, but when you thought about the guide for billings in 1Q, did you take anything into consideration around COVID just in terms of deal slippage? I know this is really fluid and I think we're all digesting it in real time. But I was just kind of curious if you have thought about sort of pipeline coverage a little bit differently anything like that? And then Dan I know you had to do Momentum virtually this year. But I was also just kind of curious sort of with your conversations maybe around it with the GSIs and how that's going? And maybe if that could be a new sort of opportunity for you this year. Thanks.\nMike Sheridan: Yes. So starting with guide for Q1 and really for the fiscal year, all of our guidance has been developed in the same methodologies that we've used in the past. Of course, we're watching very closely any developments with COVID. We do look at our pipeline. We do look at our ability to generate opportunities. We look at our close rates. We look at all of that information. And that to date we have not yet seen any material changes in our trends. Of course, we have more visibility in the near-term than we have as the year unfolds and I think we're all going to be learning that together. But we're comfortable that with all the information that we've had we've incorporated it into the guidance that I just summarized.\nDan Springer: Yes. And the question around GSI. I'll sort of point to three things: The first one is if you think about the guidance that Mike gave he referred to the fact that we believe there's so much demand coming from the systems integrators to do these projects with us that we've actually changed our expectation on the amount of professional services growth we would have. Two, you did mention Momentum and while we did make it a virtual event, I'll point out that we still had some of our most important customers and partners participate in it including Accenture who came and presented in our virtual cat. And three, the last point I'll just take you back to what we said from the beginning. As the Agreement Cloud builds out with more components, it just becomes a richer and richer opportunity for the systems integrators to build an Agreement Cloud practice. So we see all three of those things contributed to some really exciting opportunity with the GSI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMatt Wells: This is actually Matt Wells on for Walter here. And Dan I was just curious, if you could rank order the drivers of growth in fiscal 2021 and maybe just between expansion and then customer growth and net adds? And on top of that just your expectations for growth international versus domestic?\nDan Springer: So I think \u2013 we think this is pretty broad-based. But if I thought about your question around the first piece was the separation from the base to net new. From a revenue standpoint, as you know because it's a SaaS model in any given period, dramatically more of the revenue is going to come from the base because we have the installed base phenomenon that Mike walked you all through in the past. But from a standpoint of the strength there, if you take a look at dollar net retention rate, we're pleased to see a couple of quarters in a row that up at the higher end of our range at 117%. We continue to see a lot of strength with our expansion motion. At the same time we did mention that we started putting more focus in splitting out groups that were focused on land versus expand or hunter versus farmer and we're quite pleased with the success we're seeing on the dedicated hunter part of that model. So I don't \u2013 I would say, if I had to put one just because of the volume, I'll of course put it to the base and the growth of the base. And then the last thing I'd just add to that is because we are now starting to really produce more Agreement Cloud products on top of our incredible leadership position in eSignature, I think that gives us even more sort of gas in the tank to grow with our existing base customers.\nMatt Wells: The same style, one is pedal one, go ahead.\nDan Springer: No I just want to say and I think we see strength across the board geographically. We've mentioned in the past that North America because it's the driver of our business because it's a lion's share. We continue to see great strength there on top of the opportunities we see in international markets.\nMatt Wells: That's helpful. And I have a question related to COVID. You noted that most of your workforce is entirely remote. I'm just curious when implementing DocuSign software in a customer, how much of that work can be done remote or over the web versus actually them having to go on site?\nDan Springer: Yes. I mean \u2013 so the vast majority of our implementations are done remote. And of course, if you think about the perfect example of that it's our web and mobile customers, where they never actually have to speak. Not only do they don't have to have us in person they don't need to speak to us to our board. We do find with some of our larger enterprise customers that they get more value when some of the installation is done on their premises. But we have not had the opportunity in the past to consider doing that completely remotely. And it may be in the new way of business over the next X period of time here then we'll do more of it. I can tell you this as we've moved now to the model having all of our employees remote, I've been so pleased how all of our business continuity programs have worked and we have not missed a beat in terms of maintaining the productivity of our team. So I'm hopeful we'll be able to have that same positive impact as we work with our customers if we need to do those installation projects remotely as well.\nMatt Wells: Really helpful color. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe one Dan for you. With respect to Momentum, how much of a pipeline generating or closing event is that for you? And just I guess anecdotally what kind of a delay do you expect to pipeline generation or close \u2013 sale closing just given the event went virtual? And then just a quick follow-up. Mike you mentioned no change to the guidance methodology. But I guess given the current events I mean, what gives you the confidence to not change the guidance methodology at the current point?\nDan Springer: Okay I'll go first. So Momentum is a super important event for us but it is \u2013 in totality of our marketing efforts it's a very small piece. One of the things that's interesting about the event moving to virtual, we were thrilled with the results. I'll just give you a couple high level metrics to give you a perspective on it. Normally, we'd expect from the San Francisco event maybe 1000, 2000 people would be here and it would be great. When we move to virtual, we basically had five times that number of people participate. So we had a big increase. And we also saw that there was a higher absolute number of leads generated than last year's in-person event. Now there is a mix difference because we had some more small businesses, so I can't say all opportunities are of equal size. But we found that this is a fantastic way for us to reach our customers. And as we start thinking about our plans for next year we were actually rethinking how we're going to do our mix in person versus virtual events. So there's nothing that came out of Momentum this year for me thinking that was going to be a slowing or an elongation of our business.\nMike Sheridan: Yes and in terms of the guidance, I think our basic philosophy remains the same which is we're going to guide what we know. Clearly the more current the information, the better finality we will have for example around Q1. And as I mentioned before, we have done a lot of work looking at our pricing trends. We've done a lot of work looking at our demand Gen trends, our close rates tracking trends. We have all of that information to inform us on the closer periods. And right now we're roughly halfway through Q1. So that's useful information. As you look out into future quarters I think again we're in the same position as everybody else. I don't have information to second guess the plan that we put together to execute against and we're putting all of our resources against that execution. And as Dan said operationally, we have not really missed a beat to date in terms of our ability to execute and be productive. If something develops that gives us more clarity about something different than that in future quarters we of course will update it. But to do so now with the information available to us we felt would be premature and frankly would be more like guesswork than guidance.\nAlex Zukin: Understood. And maybe just as a quick follow-up on hiring. What are you seeing right now with respect to your hiring trends as you move more remote in that department? And is there any kind of I would say risk around just the volume of reps you need to hire or engineers you need to hire as it moves fully remote?\nDan Springer: Yes we have not made any changes in our expectations or plans for hiring. And I can tell you earlier this week we had one day where we onboarded 31 new DocuSigners remotely. So we have actually figured out our team has just done a fantastic job and I really appreciate you bringing it up in building these capabilities into virtual approaches. And the best example I probably should have managed it upfront was \u2013 mentioned upfront was what we did when we moved our Momentum conference from what was going to be a multi-day event into a couple of hour stream followed up by a lot of online classes. And our team has just mobilized, team DocuSign and said, we are going to make these things work in a virtual environment. I'm confident that we're going to be able to continue to do that forward and scale the business this year with our hiring.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Mike, a question on margins. I think everybody on the call can agree that DocuSign should have pretty good operating leverage over time. But evidently that's really not going to kick in in fiscal 2021 given your guidance for 6% operating margin. So I had three questions on this short ones. First of all, what are the investment priorities for DocuSign in fiscal 2021 that might be weighing a little bit on those operating margins? Secondly, is there any change to the path to get to 20-plus percent operating margins that you talked about at the time of the IPO? And then third, when you do close Seal is there a prospect that we get a bit of a down leg in that 6% guide? Thank you.\nMike Sheridan : Yes. Thanks Karl. So a couple of things. One, my guidance is a range where I didn't actually guide a percentage for operating margin. And I think within that range depending upon the investment profile that we choose for growth during the fiscal year, we could be at the higher mid or lower end of that. So I wouldn't want to call out a single percentage. I don't think the guidance ranges would support that. At the highest level what I would tell you is that if you look at our performance, we continue to see ourselves as being in a high-growth period of time and we're going to continue to invest in that. We have been demonstrating including in fiscal 2020 continued progress in leverage and I expect to continue that in fiscal 2021. The key is what is the balance that we want to adopt. And could we grow that bottom line faster? We could. It would probably sub-optimize some of the investments that we could make to continue to drive growth. What are those investments? I would call out Seal is one of them. When we do roll Seal into our numbers, I don't think as I had mentioned it's going to have a dramatic impact on our top or bottom line, but it's a smaller business that is investing a lot in R&D. And so it will have some impact on that, but the exchange of some bottom line dilution for the opportunity of growth that that provides to us long-term. Those are the kinds of decisions that we're going to continue to make. In terms of the long-term operating model of 20% to 25% leverage, I think that we continue to track towards that. Again, I think fiscal 2020 both in terms of the growth in our cash flow and our bottom line is good evidence that we are tracking towards that. And we're going to continue to endeavor to find that right balance. I think we're pretty much on target with it, but -- so that everybody is clear we do continue to believe right now the right priority for us is to continue to drive growth with responsible leverage.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. And then maybe Mike as a follow-up on operating cash flow. I don't think your stock is really getting valued at least near-term on cash flow, but it's still important to model correctly. So if operating margins will be up modestly given the investment priorities you mentioned 100 bps or so. And in fiscal 2020, you did operating cash flow margins of 12%. Is it a reasonable starting point to model fiscal 2021 operating cash flow margins up a similar 100 bps to 13-ish percent? Is that a decent starting point?\nMike Sheridan: Well, we don't guide the cash flow Karl specifically, but I do think that if you look at the historical relationship of our P&L margins with our operating cash flow, I think that's the best proxy to use as you build your model.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful, and congrats on the terrific billings guidance.\nMike Sheridan: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rishi with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi. This is actually Hannah Rudoff on for Rishi today. Thank you for taking my question. So I know you said you haven't seen material changes in trends so far from COVID. But can you talk about the impact to the business and to adoption you expect to see from COVID-related travel bans? So I'm thinking if no one is traveling to close deals and making more businesses on the DocuSign to negotiate deals and find them so any color you could provide on that will be great.\nDan Springer : Yes. I think from a standpoint of visibility to that, I don't think there's anything we've seen there would be a change. And as Mike said about the guidance that we provided, we took all the latest information we can have and brought that to bear. And then to the second part of your question around, how we think about the longer-term impact? Look, we think that there's a digital transformation phenomenon that's going to occur. Whether episodes like this tragedy around coronavirus make some companies mildly accelerate that? I suppose it's possible. We think it's the long-term trend that's important and companies are realizing, there's a better way to do business getting rid of the paper-based processes, which are hard on themselves hard on their customers and hard on the environment. We don't think that trend is going to be dramatically moved one way or another by this pandemic. So we have -- it's not leading us at this point change our perspective on the timing.\nMike Sheridan: And I would add to your specific question around travel. I think one thing to remember about our go-to-market structure, we have everything from e-commerce. Through large enterprise and in between is commercial and our commercial motion is largely inside sales. So we do have travel that's in the enterprise side of things. Many of our customers there are working with us, because they're going through the same thing of figuring out how to work together through Zoom and other techniques like that. But do remember that a lot of our go-to-market is through inside sales reformers as well.\nHannah Rudoff: Okay. Great. That's super helpful. And then could you talk about how we should be thinking about subscription gross margins across the course of the year?\nMike Sheridan: Yes I think I put a guidance of total gross margins and I think that the subscription trend should be similar to what we've seen in prior years and most recently fiscal 2020.\nHannah Rudoff: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. And first of all, let me say, I applaud you guys' actions in terms of making the conference virtual and having everyone work from home keep everyone safe. And I know you made that decision early when it was harder to make than it is now. So I guess, Dan my first question is and we kind of hit this a little bit, but would you expect the usage of DocuSign to start going up basically this week as everyone is starting to work remotely?\nDan Springer: So we don't expect to have any dramatic change sort of in the usage. We think the use cases that people have will be dramatically unchanged. We think they'll be pleased that they have DocuSign as that option.\nPat Walravens: Yes.\nDan Springer: But at this point, we're not expecting any dramatic change in usage. The only thing I would mention is remember that from a financial standpoint, a short-term change in usage probably wouldn't also have a dramatic impact, because we don't really sort of have an overage model. People buy capacity. As Mike has walked through everyone in the past, and so if there were some fluctuations we probably wouldn't see that have a big impact on our short-term financials anyway.\nPat Walravens: Okay. And so if people use more than the capacity they licensed what happens next?\nDan Springer: When they get to their next cycle, I mean, if it's dramatic then we might have a chat with them about do they have the appropriate level. But usually we just wait. And when they got to their renewal cycle, we would say, looks like your business needs have grown. That's fantastic. We consider it great, because of the high ROI. They even consider it great too and then we increase, with an upsell motion, their capacity going forward.\nPat Walravens: Okay, great. And then, Mike, maybe this is for you. So the federal data center is going to be finished, I guess, in the next three months or so. Why is that important?\nMike Sheridan: Well, I think, first off, I'd want to make sure that everybody knows that we are in production today, where we have work to do to complete it. But we do -- it's actually in production with active customers today. It's important for the long term, I think, to build out that vertical. Pat, our approach to it has been starting a couple of years ago, getting the right certifications in place to qualify to sell to the most number of federal agencies through our FedRAMP efforts. A percentage of those agencies require the private data center, not all of them, but a percentage of them. So when I was talking before about investing in growth, the investments that we're making today aren't necessarily targeted at just a fiscal 2021 increase in our growth. It's a longer-term view of positioning ourselves as the strongest provider, such that as that market does gain more traction we're not encountering unnecessary slowdowns in our sales process. So both of those efforts have been designed to really make fed an important vertical for us over time. And, yes, it's good to be coming close to the completion of the data centers. It's also good to have them in production at this stage.\nPat Walravens: Great. And then, last one and this is hard, I know, but all this digital transformation spending has been in a really strong economic environment. Do you think the level of urgency around digital transformation diminishes in a recession?\nDan Springer: Yes, I don't. Because, I think, for most of our customers, at least half of the focus is around efficiency. And people see the incredibly high ROI. And I can't speak for all-digital transformation programs, of course, but as I think about the ones that are DocuSign-centric people are laser-focused on the ROI they get from getting rid of those manual processes, the wasted labor, getting rid of things like the transportation cost, the shipping, et cetera. That's a big focus. So I don't think in a recession you would see people pull back on that. I would say that any time if you had a significant recession, you expect people to kind of shoot first ask questions later and that could lead to some delays. But, in general, we think the business case just gets stronger when people need to find those efficiencies.\nPat Walravens: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question is from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much guys and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Very quick questions from my end. The CLM product, certainly feels like you're getting a significantly more consistent performance from your sales teams around CLM? And would it be correct to characterize CLM as one of the bigger drivers of upsell that you're seeing benefit your net revenue retention rate in North America?\nDan Springer: So, let me answer that in two pieces. The first piece is, to your question, yes. I mentioned, our super big excitement around the Gartner classification. Mike had mentioned last period that we were exceeding our expectations in CLM in terms of our internal goals. So I think those are both strong endorsements of your question. But when you ask the question specifically to our overall economics, I would just remind you that eSignature is still significantly the largest contributor to our business. So if you thought about our overall upsell to our business, CLM would not actually be as big as the opportunity from eSignature. It's not that CLM is not amazing and we're not killing it out there. These are just a law of large numbers issue. So, again, that would be my only modifier. But, conceptually, I think, we're with you 100% on everything else, just don't lose the sight of the scale of that eSignature business.\nStan Zlotsky: Right. That makes sense. And maybe just piggybacking on an earlier question around federal. How are you guys thinking about the federal opportunity into fiscal 2021. Or should we be thinking that that's more of a fiscal 2022 type of opportunity, from a revenue perspective and billings, obviously? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yes. I mean, I think, we continue to see the strength. We had some big wins in 2020 and I think our aspiration is we're going to have more big wins in 2021. I know we've tried to be tempered and saying you have to understand in working with the federal government as a customer while they can be a great customer, the pace sometimes is not what we would see in some of our other verticals. So we're eyes wide open on that. But I think we look at this year as will be another strong year for us. And as Mike said, one of our big enthusiasms around completing the federal data center the IL4, we internally call it, is to unlock even more opportunity with both use cases and agencies that we'll see that DocuSign is very federal friendly as a supplier.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nKamil Mielczarek: Hi. This is Kamil Mielczarek on for Bhavan Suri. Congratulations on the solid results. So you've estimated in the past your Systems of Agreement TAM is around $50 billion with eSignature at $25 billion. Can you provide some details on your product roadmap? And as you look out over the long term, what is the time line to expand into all four phases: into preparing, signing, acting and managing? What milestone should we be looking for?\nDan Springer: So, let me give you a couple of thoughts on that. First off, when we talk about our TAM, we did sort of really thoughtful analysis at the time of our IPO, which we have continued to update around the eSignature TAM and we feel very solid about that $25 billion opportunity. When we talk about the rest of the Agreement Cloud, we talked about a rough doubling of that. But I just want to make sure you understand the level of analysis on that core business. We're the clear leader and we have so much history. It's very, very strong. For the rest of the Agreement Cloud, it's less precise of an estimate and that's why we tend to use the term of an approximate doubling. Then within the categories of the Agreement Cloud, to Stan's question a minute ago, CLM, which is heavily in the Manage phase is an area that we're probably most excited about. We have good progress already, but we just see tremendous growth opportunity. In the Prepare phase, which has a component that can relate to CLM, but also has like our gen and negotiate products, we're off to a great start in those products which we launched at Dreamforce last year. I would tell you, I think, the dollar opportunity there is smaller, because it is going to be a business that's focused on our smaller and -- SMBs and smaller commercial customers. So it may not have that same proportion of the TAM there. And then, we've always talked about the Act phase and how important and integrated that is with things like API. But it's been a part of our business for years, albeit, smaller and we see that it continuing to grow and increasingly becoming a bigger piece of the overall Agreement Cloud. So just in closing, I'd say, we're in all of the spaces today. Sign and Manage are the ones that we've said we think have the biggest growth opportunities as a share of that going forward.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's great color. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up, when you first acquired SpringCM, it initially extended your sales cycle slightly, which drove some temporary deceleration in the business. How much risk is there that you would see a similar impact from Seal Software? And how will your sales or go-to-market process change once Seal Software is closed? Thank you.\nDan Springer: I think it's very little and very little. There was a big difference. When we bought Spring, we didn't have an existing commercial relationship in place, where we were selling their products. We've been selling Seal for over 1.5 years. And I think that motion is now very well understood by our field force. So, I don't expect that to be very different once we close the deal and integrate them. Obviously, in the period between now and close, we have to operate the businesses independently. But once we do close as Mike said, we're targeting that in our second quarter. I believe it will be a relatively seamless integration from that standpoint because of our experience in already selling their products.\nKamil Mielczarek: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks again.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Ives: Yes, thanks. Great quarter obviously in a volatile environment. So just -- can you maybe just from a high level to talk -- if you compare a year ago, six months ago, just how things are changing in terms of your conversations with customers in terms of being more strategic obviously deals are getting larger. And maybe, you can just give some examples of that and just strategically how the view of DocuSign within companies is changing at least from your perspective?\nDan Springer: Yes. I mean, I think in the six-month time frame, I'd say I don't think there's been a dramatic change. I do think there is this recent announcement with Seal, a lot of very positive responses that we've gotten from customers. I was actually just in Europe a couple of weeks ago and somewhat ironically just before we announced the deal, I had two large customers say, Dan, we just love what you guys are doing jointly with Seal, you guys should really buy them. And obviously, I was excited that we get to make that happen shortly upon my return. But I think the macro change that is different is just that people are saying, we used to think of you as a fantastic provider as a eSignature process, which was a fantastic driver of success in their business. And now they're looking at it and saying, the Agreement Cloud is something bigger and broader and we can in fact be a more strategic partner to companies. That's why we really believe this is the next big cloud opportunity. So, I think that's what the change has been. I think it's been fairly consistent as we've added the additional functionality and brought that vision to the market. So, I'm excited about that momentum and I expect it to continue going forward as we execute against bringing the additional product functionality to our customers.\nDan Ives: Got it. And do you -- just given the environment especially maybe on strategic M&A on some small private companies like are -- and obviously a lot of customers are going to drive potential acquisitions for you right in terms of just different areas of the product suite. Did you expect to be more aggressive on just -- what I would view as more tuck-in M&A especially as you use this opportunity to just further build-out the suite?\nDan Springer: Well, there's a couple of things that I think give us the potential to do that. We're still going to try to make the right one-off each individual business decision. But we brought in Eric Darwin as I mentioned, who used to lead the LinkedIn corporate development team. We obviously wouldn't have brought in such a senior leader, if we didn't think there was a broad opportunity for us over time in M&A. We didn't do that until after we had the successful execution of the Spring deal because, we wanted to make sure that we were moving at a cautious pace as we started building out this capability within DocuSign. So Mike and I have been very clear that, we're not going to acquire for the sake of acquiring. We're only going to acquire when we see great deals that also drive our very clear strategy for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. But obviously, we wouldn't have made the pull with Eric if we didn't see that. Second thing is, we really feel we were successful in the integration of Spring. And having that now done and under our belt, I think that gives us more confidence that we could do more deals. Seal obviously was the next one. But I would stop short of saying; I think we're going to become some sort of an acquisition machine. I think we're a company that wants to do really thoughtful deals that can have a meaningful impact for our customers in building out their Agreement Cloud solution. So, I wouldn't expect at this point a dramatic increase in velocity. At your specific tuck-in point, there's multiple pieces behind that like what's happening in the macro environment. I think some of the noise we've been hearing around sort of the VC community, not continuing to support tech companies, I think that's dramatically exaggerated. So, we don't think there's going to be some sort of shopping spree kind of phenomenon for us or for other companies coming forward. I think VC community is going to continue to do a good job of supporting the companies they've invested in. And they've raised a lot of money and have a lot of dry powder to do that. So I would think you should expect more of the same for us with maybe some slight acceleration as we continue to build our confidence that we can do these fantastic deals bring tremendous companies into DocuSign. And as I said, really provide more and more value for our customers in their Agreement Cloud solution.\nDan Ives: Yes. Thanks again for all the insight and transparency and a tough time for investors. Appreciate it.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor over to management for closing comments.\nDan Springer: Yes. Well, thank you all for joining us particularly in the light of the macro environment. We hope you all stay healthy and safe and we look forward to seeing you when we can next be out to see you all. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks Dan and good afternoon everyone. As Dan mentioned, DocuSign had a very successful fiscal 2020 in which we saw continued strong growth in our core eSignature offerings and increasing interest in upsells among our customers for our broader Agreement Cloud suite. For the fourth quarter, total revenue reached $275 million and subscription revenue reached $258 million, both representing a 38% increase year-over-year. For the full year, total revenue increased 39% to $974 million and subscription revenue increased 38% to $918 million. International revenue continued to grow over 40% year-over-year to $49 million in the quarter and $171 million for the year. Fourth quarter billings rose 40% year-over-year to $367 million and billings for the full year increased 38% to $1.1 billion. We added almost 27,000 new customers in the quarter including nearly 6,000 direct customers. This represents a 33% year-over-year increase in our commercial and enterprise installed base and brings our fiscal 2020 total customers to approximately 589,000 of which about 75,000 are direct customers. We had another strong quarter of upsells into our installed base led by our North American business. This quarter our dollar net retention was 117%. Customers with ACV is greater than $300,000 grew 41% year-over-year to a total of 437 customers. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 79% compared with 78% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was also 79% compared with 80% in fiscal 2019. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 84% compared with 85% a year ago. For the full year, subscription gross margin was also 84% compared with 86% in fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $196 million or 71% of total revenue compared with $149 million or 75% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, operating expenses were $720 million or 74% of revenue compared with $544 million or 78% of revenue in fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP operating profit for Q4 was $21 million or an 8% operating margin compared with $7 million or a 4% operating margin last year. For the full year, operating margin was 5% up from 2% in fiscal 2019 as we continue to make progress on improving our operating leverage. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $22 million compared with $10 million last year. For the full year, net income was $59 million, up from $18 million in fiscal 2019. We ended the year with 3,909 employees a year-over-year increase of 29%. Operating cash flow increased 33% year-over-year to $46 million in the fourth quarter compared to $34 million in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow was $16 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the prior year. This decrease relates to our capital investments to complete the build-out of our Dublin office in Q4 and continued work on our dedicated federal data center which we expect to complete in the first half of fiscal 2021. For the full year, operating cash flow increased 52% year-over-year to $116 million compared to $76 million a year ago, while free cash flow was $44 million compared to $46 million in fiscal 2019. Turning to our guidance, as you know, we recently announced our intent to acquire Seal Software. We expect this acquisition to close in fiscal Q2. The guidance ranges I'm about to discuss do not include contributions from Seal other than topline contributions we expect to generate from our existing partnership with Seal. We will update our guidance to include contributions from Seal after the acquisition closes. Seal is significantly smaller than DocuSign, so the impact of including Seal will not be significant to our top or bottom-line. In terms of topline guidance, we expect subscription revenue of $266 million to $270 million in Q1 and $1.21 billion to $1.214 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect total revenue of $280 million to $284 million in Q1 and $1.272 billion to $1.276 billion for fiscal 2021. I have separately guided subscription and total revenues because we anticipate different growth rates in these components of revenue. Specifically, we believe that we will be successful in engaging system integrators to take on more of our professional services engagements in fiscal 2021 as we have more projects that involve multiple products from our Agreement Cloud. This positive development will reduce the year-over-year growth rate in our professional service and other revenue. For the remainder of our guidance, we anticipate billings of $279 million to $289 million in Q1 and $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q1 and fiscal 2021. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 47% to 49% of revenues in Q1 and fiscal 2021. R&D in the range of 13% to 15% of revenue for Q1 and fiscal 2021. And finally, G&A in the range of 9% to 11% of revenue for Q1 and fiscal 2021. For the first quarter, we expect $2 million to $3 million of non-GAAP interest and other non-operating income. And for fiscal 2021, we expect non-GAAP interest and other -- and non-operating income of $8 million to $12 million. We expect a tax provision of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million for Q1 and $6 million to $10 million for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 195 million to 200 million shares for Q1 and fiscal 2021. Overall, fiscal 2020 was another outstanding year for DocuSign. As we continue to broaden our Agreement Cloud, we are excited at the interest we are seeing from our customers and partners as we begin fiscal 2021. Thanks for joining us today. And now we will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. So starting with guide for Q1 and really for the fiscal year, all of our guidance has been developed in the same methodologies that we've used in the past. Of course, we're watching very closely any developments with COVID. We do look at our pipeline. We do look at our ability to generate opportunities. We look at our close rates. We look at all of that information. And that to date we have not yet seen any material changes in our trends. Of course, we have more visibility in the near-term than we have as the year unfolds and I think we're all going to be learning that together. But we're comfortable that with all the information that we've had we've incorporated it into the guidance that I just summarized. Yes and in terms of the guidance, I think our basic philosophy remains the same which is we're going to guide what we know. Clearly the more current the information, the better finality we will have for example around Q1. And as I mentioned before, we have done a lot of work looking at our pricing trends. We've done a lot of work looking at our demand Gen trends, our close rates tracking trends. We have all of that information to inform us on the closer periods. And right now we're roughly halfway through Q1. So that's useful information. As you look out into future quarters I think again we're in the same position as everybody else. I don't have information to second guess the plan that we put together to execute against and we're putting all of our resources against that execution. And as Dan said operationally, we have not really missed a beat to date in terms of our ability to execute and be productive. If something develops that gives us more clarity about something different than that in future quarters we of course will update it. But to do so now with the information available to us we felt would be premature and frankly would be more like guesswork than guidance. Yes. Thanks Karl. So a couple of things. One, my guidance is a range where I didn't actually guide a percentage for operating margin. And I think within that range depending upon the investment profile that we choose for growth during the fiscal year, we could be at the higher mid or lower end of that. So I wouldn't want to call out a single percentage. I don't think the guidance ranges would support that. At the highest level what I would tell you is that if you look at our performance, we continue to see ourselves as being in a high-growth period of time and we're going to continue to invest in that. We have been demonstrating including in fiscal 2020 continued progress in leverage and I expect to continue that in fiscal 2021. The key is what is the balance that we want to adopt. And could we grow that bottom line faster? We could. It would probably sub-optimize some of the investments that we could make to continue to drive growth. What are those investments? I would call out Seal is one of them. When we do roll Seal into our numbers, I don't think as I had mentioned it's going to have a dramatic impact on our top or bottom line, but it's a smaller business that is investing a lot in R&D. And so it will have some impact on that, but the exchange of some bottom line dilution for the opportunity of growth that that provides to us long-term. Those are the kinds of decisions that we're going to continue to make. In terms of the long-term operating model of 20% to 25% leverage, I think that we continue to track towards that. Again, I think fiscal 2020 both in terms of the growth in our cash flow and our bottom line is good evidence that we are tracking towards that. And we're going to continue to endeavor to find that right balance. I think we're pretty much on target with it, but -- so that everybody is clear we do continue to believe right now the right priority for us is to continue to drive growth with responsible leverage. Well, we don't guide the cash flow Karl specifically, but I do think that if you look at the historical relationship of our P&L margins with our operating cash flow, I think that's the best proxy to use as you build your model. Thanks. And I would add to your specific question around travel. I think one thing to remember about our go-to-market structure, we have everything from e-commerce. Through large enterprise and in between is commercial and our commercial motion is largely inside sales. So we do have travel that's in the enterprise side of things. Many of our customers there are working with us, because they're going through the same thing of figuring out how to work together through Zoom and other techniques like that. But do remember that a lot of our go-to-market is through inside sales reformers as well. Yes I think I put a guidance of total gross margins and I think that the subscription trend should be similar to what we've seen in prior years and most recently fiscal 2020. Well, I think, first off, I'd want to make sure that everybody knows that we are in production today, where we have work to do to complete it. But we do -- it's actually in production with active customers today. It's important for the long term, I think, to build out that vertical. Pat, our approach to it has been starting a couple of years ago, getting the right certifications in place to qualify to sell to the most number of federal agencies through our FedRAMP efforts. A percentage of those agencies require the private data center, not all of them, but a percentage of them.

It's a longer-term view of positioning ourselves as the strongest provider, such that as that market does gain more traction we're not encountering unnecessary slowdowns in our sales process. So both of those efforts have been designed to really make fed an important vertical for us over time. And, yes, it's good to be coming close to the completion of the data centers. It's also good to have them in production at this stage."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks Anne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 earnings call. We have a lot to share with you today. We'll cover our performance for the quarter as well as the entire fiscal year. We'll talk in more detail about our recently announced intention to acquire Seal Software. And we'll look ahead to our focus areas for fiscal 2021. But before we get to that, I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge the evolving situation with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Over the past few weeks, our team has been meeting daily to monitor the ongoing developments. We've taken several steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and their families as well as our customers and partners. Actions we've taken include; transforming our annual North America Customer Conference Momentum into a virtual live stream event held last week; and our decision to move our global workforce to an entirely remote environment as of the end of this week. We will continue to monitor the situation and as we learn more, we'll update our plans accordingly. With that said, let's move on to our business performance over our second year as a public company. It was just 12 months ago that we introduced the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. Our suite of applications and integrations that help organizations automate the entire agreement process that is; preparing, signing, acting on and managing those agreements. We see agreements increasingly integrated with the cloud software suites like sales, service, marketing, HR and finance. Our belief is that organizations will need an Agreement Cloud to act as a platform of record for agreements and agreement processes, which will be connected to the other clouds. For example, integrating with the HR system for offer letters or the CRM system for sales contracts. As we have said, we believe this represents the next big cloud opportunity. Over the past fiscal year, we have broadened our product and service offerings to cover every stage of the agreement process. And of the five new products that we shipped in fiscal 2020, I'd especially like to call out DocuSign CLM. Launched in November last year this builds on our acquisition of SpringCM. And it was just named by Gartner as a leader in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for contract life cycle management. We are very proud of this recognition. The positive impact of all this work can be seen in our financial results, a few of which I want to share with you. Now for Q4, DocuSign's revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $275 million and billings grew by 40% year-over-year to $367 million. We were again profitable on a non-GAAP basis and we continue to generate positive cash flow. Our total customer count climbed to approximately 589,000 worldwide and our dollar net retention rate came in at 117%. For the full fiscal year, our revenue grew 39% to $974 million and our billings grew 38% to $1.1 billion. I am incredibly proud of the entire DocuSign team for this collective effort. But of course we're not going to stop there. As we continue to define and grow the Agreement Cloud category, we know that contract analytics and artificial intelligence will play an increasingly important role. This technology can rapidly search large collections of agreements by legal concept rather than just by keywords. It can automatically extract, analyze and compare contract terms and it can even identify areas of risk and business opportunity for our customers. So we couldn't be more excited to be acquiring the pioneer in this space Seal Software. As many of you know we formed a partnership with Seal about two years ago where we began reselling its flagship offering as DocuSign Intelligent Insights. And we also made a strategic $15 million investment in the company in March of last year. Having seen Seal's technology and people at work with our customers, as well as in the broader marketplace, we wanted to bring them fully aboard into DocuSign. To give you a little more color let me share a few customer examples. One large international information services company reduced the time they spent on legal reviews by 75%. And a global financial services company automated the analysis of more than 2.5 million contractual data points across its supplier agreement. And an aviation company was able to review more than 25,000 agreements in just a few business days, something that could have taken months if done in the traditional manual fashion. Once this acquisition closes, we will continue selling Seal's flagship contract analytics product. We'll also be able to integrate Seal's technology across the entire Agreement Cloud. We'll start with CLM given the immediate market opportunity for AI to enhance workflows there. And over time we expect to apply Seal's AI technology across a broad range of our existing and new products. Now these developments will complement and extend our other work in AI, some of which we showed at our Momentum conference last week. For example, we demoed auto-tagging. It's a new feature in eSignature. It uses AI to automatically place the tags for signatures, dates and other fields. Normally this is something that needs to be done manually when preparing a document for signature. With auto-tagging it can happen automatically and immediately and it is a huge wow factor for our users. We also demoed a product under development called Agreement Analyzer. It uses Seal's AI to analyze inbound agreements identifying areas of risk and triggering actions based on the content of its various clauses. So, we believe this whole area of AI meets agreements is incredibly exciting. While nascent today it represents a key greenfield opportunity for the future as well as a deepening of our competitive moat. We will keep you updated once the Seal acquisition closes in our second quarter. For the last part of my comments today, I want to look to the future and how we are thinking about scaling our business. Based on our fiscal 2020 results, we are on the cusp of joining an elite group of SaaS companies that have crossed the $1 billion revenue threshold. This is a major milestone, but it's also just a stepping stone to the exciting future that lies ahead. Our first $1 billion was built largely on our leadership in eSignature. The next $1 billion will continue the eSignature expansion but also be boosted by substantially broader opportunities for the rest of the Agreement Cloud. To make that happen and to ensure we operate at the intersection of the world's business and agreement processes, we'll focus on three key strategic priorities. One, continue executing on our Agreement Cloud vision and strategy which fiscal 2020 customer demand has shown is working well. Two, live and breed customer success around the world in everything that we do. As part of that we'll also continue to leverage our amazing partner network both our 350 ISV partners and our growing SI partners that are building Agreement Cloud practices to drive our joint customer success. And three, we ensure DocuSign remains a top place to work so that we can attract and retain the talent that can drive our scale to the next level. And to that point, I wanted to share that we recently appointed Rob Giglio as our new Chief Marketing Officer; and Eric Darwin as our Head of Corporate Development. Both will be reporting to our COO, Scott Olrich. Rob comes to us from Adobe, where he helped to architect the growth strategy for the company's self-service cloud business and oversaw significant international expansion. Eric joins us from LinkedIn where he led the corporate development team there. In addition you may recall that we named Emily Heath as our Chief Trust and Security Officer in October of last year. Emily was formerly the CISO at United Airlines and we are already benefiting from our considerable experience. So, that's it for my section of today's call. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we made as a company in fiscal 2020 and I'm excited about the Agreement Cloud's prospects to transform agreements and agreement processes around the world in fiscal 2021 and beyond. So, with that I'd like to hand it over to Mike for a deeper look at our Q4 and our fiscal year financials. Mike? Yes. So I think the answer is our strength is a lot in our traditional places. Financial services in particular has continued to be strong for us. We see telecom with good strength as well. From your real estate question, we haven't seen anything different. I know lower interest rates might start to change activity there. But at this point in time, we haven't seen anything. And keep in mind, when we talk about real estate, it's often much more focused on volume on the transactions of buying and selling homes versus refinancing. So I wouldn't think a dramatically different interest rate environment from refinancing would change it. I suppose it could spur additional new purchases and sales and that would have some lift, but in general, we haven't seen any noticeable change at this point. Well I think you have to look at two pieces. You have to look at what we've been doing with Agreement Analyzer think about some of the traditional Seal software pieces and that's going to have a heavier focus towards our enterprise and our larger commercial customers. But as I mentioned on the call, we really think there's an opportunity to take the AI technology here and spread that across our entire offering and we would be really excited to make that available to more and more smaller customers as well. And particularly this idea taking the product that was coded into Seal now, which allows people to analyze incoming agreements that I referred to. That I think is going to be an opportunity that would be used for small businesses all the way up to enterprises. So we think it's going to be broadly based, but different aspects of it are going to be appropriate for different customer segments. Yes. And the question around GSI. I'll sort of point to three things: The first one is if you think about the guidance that Mike gave he referred to the fact that we believe there's so much demand coming from the systems integrators to do these projects with us that we've actually changed our expectation on the amount of professional services growth we would have. Two, you did mention Momentum and while we did make it a virtual event, I'll point out that we still had some of our most important customers and partners participate in it including Accenture who came and presented in our virtual cat. And three, the last point I'll just take you back to what we said from the beginning. As the Agreement Cloud builds out with more components, it just becomes a richer and richer opportunity for the systems integrators to build an Agreement Cloud practice. So we see all three of those things contributed to some really exciting opportunity with the GSI. So I think \u2013 we think this is pretty broad-based. But if I thought about your question around the first piece was the separation from the base to net new. From a revenue standpoint, as you know because it's a SaaS model in any given period, dramatically more of the revenue is going to come from the base because we have the installed base phenomenon that Mike walked you all through in the past. But from a standpoint of the strength there, if you take a look at dollar net retention rate, we're pleased to see a couple of quarters in a row that up at the higher end of our range at 117%. We continue to see a lot of strength with our expansion motion. At the same time we did mention that we started putting more focus in splitting out groups that were focused on land versus expand or hunter versus farmer and we're quite pleased with the success we're seeing on the dedicated hunter part of that model. So I don't \u2013 I would say, if I had to put one just because of the volume, I'll of course put it to the base and the growth of the base. And then the last thing I'd just add to that is because we are now starting to really produce more Agreement Cloud products on top of our incredible leadership position in eSignature, I think that gives us even more sort of gas in the tank to grow with our existing base customers. No I just want to say and I think we see strength across the board geographically. We've mentioned in the past that North America because it's the driver of our business because it's a lion's share. We continue to see great strength there on top of the opportunities we see in international markets. Yes. I mean \u2013 so the vast majority of our implementations are done remote. And of course, if you think about the perfect example of that it's our web and mobile customers, where they never actually have to speak. Not only do they don't have to have us in person they don't need to speak to us to our board. We do find with some of our larger enterprise customers that they get more value when some of the installation is done on their premises. But we have not had the opportunity in the past to consider doing that completely remotely. And it may be in the new way of business over the next X period of time here then we'll do more of it. I can tell you this as we've moved now to the model having all of our employees remote, I've been so pleased how all of our business continuity programs have worked and we have not missed a beat in terms of maintaining the productivity of our team. So I'm hopeful we'll be able to have that same positive impact as we work with our customers if we need to do those installation projects remotely as well. Okay I'll go first. So Momentum is a super important event for us but it is \u2013 in totality of our marketing efforts it's a very small piece. One of the things that's interesting about the event moving to virtual, we were thrilled with the results. I'll just give you a couple high level metrics to give you a perspective on it. Normally, we'd expect from the San Francisco event maybe 1000, 2000 people would be here and it would be great. When we move to virtual, we basically had five times that number of people participate. So we had a big increase. And we also saw that there was a higher absolute number of leads generated than last year's in-person event. Now there is a mix difference because we had some more small businesses, so I can't say all opportunities are of equal size. But we found that this is a fantastic way for us to reach our customers. And as we start thinking about our plans for next year we were actually rethinking how we're going to do our mix in person versus virtual events. So there's nothing that came out of Momentum this year for me thinking that was going to be a slowing or an elongation of our business. Yes we have not made any changes in our expectations or plans for hiring. And I can tell you earlier this week we had one day where we onboarded 31 new DocuSigners remotely. So we have actually figured out our team has just done a fantastic job and I really appreciate you bringing it up in building these capabilities into virtual approaches. And the best example I probably should have managed it upfront was \u2013 mentioned upfront was what we did when we moved our Momentum conference from what was going to be a multi-day event into a couple of hour stream followed up by a lot of online classes. And our team has just mobilized, team DocuSign and said, we are going to make these things work in a virtual environment. I'm confident that we're going to be able to continue to do that forward and scale the business this year with our hiring. Yes. I think from a standpoint of visibility to that, I don't think there's anything we've seen there would be a change. And as Mike said about the guidance that we provided, we took all the latest information we can have and brought that to bear. And then to the second part of your question around, how we think about the longer-term impact? Look, we think that there's a digital transformation phenomenon that's going to occur. Whether episodes like this tragedy around coronavirus make some companies mildly accelerate that? I suppose it's possible. We think it's the long-term trend that's important and companies are realizing, there's a better way to do business getting rid of the paper-based processes, which are hard on themselves hard on their customers and hard on the environment. We don't think that trend is going to be dramatically moved one way or another by this pandemic. So we have -- it's not leading us at this point change our perspective on the timing. So we don't expect to have any dramatic change sort of in the usage. We think the use cases that people have will be dramatically unchanged. We think they'll be pleased that they have DocuSign as that option. But at this point, we're not expecting any dramatic change in usage. The only thing I would mention is remember that from a financial standpoint, a short-term change in usage probably wouldn't also have a dramatic impact, because we don't really sort of have an overage model. People buy capacity. As Mike has walked through everyone in the past, and so if there were some fluctuations we probably wouldn't see that have a big impact on our short-term financials anyway. When they get to their next cycle, I mean, if it's dramatic then we might have a chat with them about do they have the appropriate level. But usually we just wait. And when they got to their renewal cycle, we would say, looks like your business needs have grown. That's fantastic. We consider it great, because of the high ROI. They even consider it great too and then we increase, with an upsell motion, their capacity going forward. Yes, I don't. Because, I think, for most of our customers, at least half of the focus is around efficiency. And people see the incredibly high ROI. And I can't speak for all-digital transformation programs, of course, but as I think about the ones that are DocuSign-centric people are laser-focused on the ROI they get from getting rid of those manual processes, the wasted labor, getting rid of things like the transportation cost, the shipping, et cetera. That's a big focus. So I don't think in a recession you would see people pull back on that. I would say that any time if you had a significant recession, you expect people to kind of shoot first ask questions later and that could lead to some delays. But, in general, we think the business case just gets stronger when people need to find those efficiencies. So, let me answer that in two pieces. The first piece is, to your question, yes. I mentioned, our super big excitement around the Gartner classification. Mike had mentioned last period that we were exceeding our expectations in CLM in terms of our internal goals. So I think those are both strong endorsements of your question. But when you ask the question specifically to our overall economics, I would just remind you that eSignature is still significantly the largest contributor to our business. So if you thought about our overall upsell to our business, CLM would not actually be as big as the opportunity from eSignature. It's not that CLM is not amazing and we're not killing it out there. These are just a law of large numbers issue. So, again, that would be my only modifier. But, conceptually, I think, we're with you 100% on everything else, just don't lose the sight of the scale of that eSignature business. Yes. I mean, I think, we continue to see the strength. We had some big wins in 2020 and I think our aspiration is we're going to have more big wins in 2021. I know we've tried to be tempered and saying you have to understand in working with the federal government as a customer while they can be a great customer, the pace sometimes is not what we would see in some of our other verticals. So we're eyes wide open on that. But I think we look at this year as will be another strong year for us. And as Mike said, one of our big enthusiasms around completing the federal data center the IL4, we internally call it, is to unlock even more opportunity with both use cases and agencies that we'll see that DocuSign is very federal friendly as a supplier. So, let me give you a couple of thoughts on that. First off, when we talk about our TAM, we did sort of really thoughtful analysis at the time of our IPO, which we have continued to update around the eSignature TAM and we feel very solid about that $25 billion opportunity. When we talk about the rest of the Agreement Cloud, we talked about a rough doubling of that. But I just want to make sure you understand the level of analysis on that core business. We're the clear leader and we have so much history. It's very, very strong. For the rest of the Agreement Cloud, it's less precise of an estimate and that's why we tend to use the term of an approximate doubling. Then within the categories of the Agreement Cloud, to Stan's question a minute ago, CLM, which is heavily in the Manage phase is an area that we're probably most excited about. We have good progress already, but we just see tremendous growth opportunity. In the Prepare phase, which has a component that can relate to CLM, but also has like our gen and negotiate products, we're off to a great start in those products which we launched at Dreamforce last year. I would tell you, I think, the dollar opportunity there is smaller, because it is going to be a business that's focused on our smaller and -- SMBs and smaller commercial customers. So it may not have that same proportion of the TAM there. And then, we've always talked about the Act phase and how important and integrated that is with things like API. But it's been a part of our business for years, albeit, smaller and we see that it continuing to grow and increasingly becoming a bigger piece of the overall Agreement Cloud. So just in closing, I'd say, we're in all of the spaces today. Sign and Manage are the ones that we've said we think have the biggest growth opportunities as a share of that going forward. I think it's very little and very little. There was a big difference. When we bought Spring, we didn't have an existing commercial relationship in place, where we were selling their products. We've been selling Seal for over 1.5 years. And I think that motion is now very well understood by our field force. So, I don't expect that to be very different once we close the deal and integrate them. Obviously, in the period between now and close, we have to operate the businesses independently. But once we do close as Mike said, we're targeting that in our second quarter. I believe it will be a relatively seamless integration from that standpoint because of our experience in already selling their products. Yes. I mean, I think in the six-month time frame, I'd say I don't think there's been a dramatic change. I do think there is this recent announcement with Seal, a lot of very positive responses that we've gotten from customers. I was actually just in Europe a couple of weeks ago and somewhat ironically just before we announced the deal, I had two large customers say, Dan, we just love what you guys are doing jointly with Seal, you guys should really buy them. And obviously, I was excited that we get to make that happen shortly upon my return. But I think the macro change that is different is just that people are saying, we used to think of you as a fantastic provider as a eSignature process, which was a fantastic driver of success in their business. And now they're looking at it and saying, the Agreement Cloud is something bigger and broader and we can in fact be a more strategic partner to companies. That's why we really believe this is the next big cloud opportunity. So, I think that's what the change has been. I think it's been fairly consistent as we've added the additional functionality and brought that vision to the market. So, I'm excited about that momentum and I expect it to continue going forward as we execute against bringing the additional product functionality to our customers. Well, there's a couple of things that I think give us the potential to do that. We're still going to try to make the right one-off each individual business decision. But we brought in Eric Darwin as I mentioned, who used to lead the LinkedIn corporate development team. We obviously wouldn't have brought in such a senior leader, if we didn't think there was a broad opportunity for us over time in M&A. We didn't do that until after we had the successful execution of the Spring deal because, we wanted to make sure that we were moving at a cautious pace as we started building out this capability within DocuSign. So Mike and I have been very clear that, we're not going to acquire for the sake of acquiring. We're only going to acquire when we see great deals that also drive our very clear strategy for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. But obviously, we wouldn't have made the pull with Eric if we didn't see that. Second thing is, we really feel we were successful in the integration of Spring. And having that now done and under our belt, I think that gives us more confidence that we could do more deals. Seal obviously was the next one. But I would stop short of saying; I think we're going to become some sort of an acquisition machine. I think we're a company that wants to do really thoughtful deals that can have a meaningful impact for our customers in building out their Agreement Cloud solution. So, I wouldn't expect at this point a dramatic increase in velocity. At your specific tuck-in point, there's multiple pieces behind that like what's happening in the macro environment. I think some of the noise we've been hearing around sort of the VC community, not continuing to support tech companies, I think that's dramatically exaggerated. So, we don't think there's going to be some sort of shopping spree kind of phenomenon for us or for other companies coming forward. I think VC community is going to continue to do a good job of supporting the companies they've invested in. And they've raised a lot of money and have a lot of dry powder to do that. So I would think you should expect more of the same for us with maybe some slight acceleration as we continue to build our confidence that we can do these fantastic deals bring tremendous companies into DocuSign. And as I said, really provide more and more value for our customers in their Agreement Cloud solution. Yes. Well, thank you all for joining us particularly in the light of the macro environment. We hope you all stay healthy and safe and we look forward to seeing you when we can next be out to see you all. Thank you so much."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Anne and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to start today with some brief updates on two areas of our business, one, our positive financial results for the third quarter and how we are driving demand for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud led by our core eSignature offering; two, a quick recap of our vision and strategy since going public last year and how we've continued to execute against that for Q3. I will then hand it over to Mike for a deeper discussion our financials, after which we can open up for Q&A. So first, let me start with some comments on our third quarter. As many of you know, DocuSign's growth is driven by three primary factors, increased adoption and use case expansion within our existing customer base, the acquisition of new customers and the development of new solutions that help companies modernize their systems of agreement. We believe our Q3 results reflect ongoing progress across all of those factors. With strong demand for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud we grew revenue by 40% year-over-year to $250 million and billings by 36% year-over-year to $269 million. We acquired 25,000 new customers, approximately 5,000 of which were direct, bringing our total number of paying customers to 562,000 worldwide, of which roughly 69,000 are direct. We were again profitable on a non-GAAP basis with operating income of nearly $17 million and this is our eighth consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP EPS. We also saw a solid uptick in our dollar net retention rate to 117%, these positive results showcase the demand for our agreement cloud suite remains strong as we head into our largest quarter of the year.  Next, I'd like to share how we are progressing on the vision and strategy we laid out, when we went public last year and how we continue to execute in Q3. By now, you're probably familiar with our Agreement Cloud vision. It builds on top of our global eSignature leadership and helps companies automate and connect their agreement processes, both before and after signature takes place. We first discussed this during our IPO. And at that time, we reinforced the importance of our core eSignature business and clearly articulated the $25 billion opportunity which is still only about 5% penetrated. We also showed how that TAM could potentially double with the expanded opportunity for the rest of the Agreement Cloud. Over the past 18 months, we've taken several steps to deliver on that vision. We acquired SpringCM in September last year and we have integrated its technology and talent into our product line and operations. Our own product development team built and delivered several new agreement cloud solutions and we partnered with specialist companies to resell select additional products that expand on our offering. We then brought all this together under the agreement cloud umbrella. Our suite of more than a dozen products now and over 350 prebuilt integration that helps organizations connect and automate their agreement processes. We also collaborate with systems integrators like ATG, Simplest and Spalding Rich, who are building out Agreement Cloud practices and broadening our ability to drive success for our joint customers. And amid all of this we have continued to enhance the functionality of our core eSignature offering, with features like responsive signing, where the Agreement automatically adapts it\u2019s formatting to the size and type of the device that the signer is using. In Q3 we continued this momentum by announcing two new agreement cloud products, the first is DocuSign negotiate, it helps companies that don't yet need full blown CLM to simplify and accelerate the process of generating, redlining and negotiating agreements, we just launched the initial version in November and is optimized specifically for the salesforce ecosystem. The second is DocuSign CLM. This is the next generation of Spring CM flagship product, it includes all the capabilities of DocuSign negotiate plus an end-to-end workflow builder, a centralized contract repository and a clause library, it is targeted an upper mid-market and enterprise customers. But we're still in the early stages of our Agreement Cloud journey. We are pleased with our progress to date. By expanding our portfolio we're motivating customers to automate more of their agreement processes which in turn drive even more eSignature. This virtuous cycle is illustrated by some interesting customer expansions we had in Q3. One of the global leaders in the ridesharing base has used both DocuSign eSignature and CLM in their sales, HR and business operations for many years. Building on that success, the company expanded its use of CLM in Q3 to coverage departments for commercial transactions, emerging technology and legal. This significantly increased the size of our commercial relationship. Additionally, a large U.S. credit union increased its eSignature usage by 300% this year and in Q3 also made a commitment to use our API to integrate eSignature into its other systems. This company plans to expand eSignature to 10 additional business units next year and we'll also evaluate using DocuSign CLM for potential implementation. A mobile analytics company expanded its use of eSignature into HR, leveraging our integration with the recruiting software provider greenhouse. This is a great example of how the Agreement Cloud integration drives departmental expense, which in turn drives revenue from greater usage. So as I bring my remarks to a close, I want to reiterate, when we went public, we had a strong eSignature business and a vision to expand our offerings for the entire agreement process, we have executed on that vision and the customer response has been strong. Based on our progress, I believe we are in a unique position to create and be a leader in the next big platform category Agreement Cloud. But just before I hand over to Mike, I also wanted to share two quick executive team updates. The first is that our Chief Product Officer, Ron Hirson, will be taking a mid-career break to focus on a health issue in his family. Ron and I have talked about this transition at great length and he's going to stay with us through the middle of next year. Even though we're incredibly sad to see him leave, we support his decision, we really appreciate his incredible impact during his six-year tenure. And we're proud of the team he's built to continue the innovation at DocuSign. Second update is our creation of a new Chief Trust and Security Officer role, which former United Airlines CISO Emily Heath is taking on. Emily has an incredible pedigree in the InfoSec industry and she will oversee information security, application and physical security, and trust services for the company out of our San Francisco office. We're thrilled to have someone of Emily's pedigree join us in this vital role. So that's it for me. Thanks for joining us today. And now Mike will walk you through the Q3 financials.\nMike Sheridan: Thanks, Dan and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder, our non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of debt discount and employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions. Also having acquired SpringCM in September last year, this is the first quarter that will include SpringCM in comparable periods from a year ago. Our Third quarter results reflect solid execution, delivering strong top line growth and profitability while continuing to drive customer success. Total revenue rose 40% year-over-year to $250 million and subscription revenue grew 41% to $238 million. Total international revenue grew over 40% year-over-year to $43 million. Total billings increased 36% year-over-year to $269 million, on a four-quarter rolling average basis billings growth was 35%. Strong demand from our core eSignature solutions coupled with growing adoption of our broader portfolio of Agreement Cloud products continued this quarter. We added approximately 25,000 new customers this quarter, 5,000 of which were direct customers. This drove a 30% year-over-year increase in our commercial and enterprise installed base. This brings our total customer base to 562,000 with roughly 69,000 direct customers worldwide. We saw notable strength in upsells into our installed base with particularly strong contribution from our North American business. We also continue to see progress in upsells of DocuSign CLM into our installed base. The combination of these factors increased our dollar net retention to 117% this quarter, within our historical range of 112% to 119%. Customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 41% year-over-year to a total of 401 customers. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 79% consistent with a year ago. Subscription gross margin was 84% compared with 85% a year ago. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $180 million or 72% of total revenue compared with $142 million or 80% of total revenue for the third quarter of last year. With the settlement of the RPost litigation G&A returned to more normalized levels in the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was $17 million or 7% operating margin in Q3. This compares to a $1 million non-GAAP operating loss or a negative 1% operating margin in Q3 of fiscal 2019. We ended the quarter with 3,723 employees, a year-over-year increase of 28%. Operating cash flow was negative $2 million as we paid out the RPost settlement in the third quarter, this compares with a positive $4 million in Q3 of last year. Free cash flow came in at negative $14 million, compared to negative $4 million in the prior year. As anticipated, the RPost litigation payment together with planned real estate investments, including our office in Dublin and our Fed datacenter impacted our cash flow in the quarter. Turning to our guidance we estimate first, revenue of $263 million to $267million in Q4 and $962 million to $966 million for fiscal 2020. In addition, we expect billings of $346 million to $356 million in Q4 and $1.083 billion to $1.093 billion for fiscal 2020. We are maintaining our guidance for non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80% for Q4 in fiscal 2020. For Q4 and fiscal 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses, we are maintaining our guidance of sales and marketing in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues or in the \u2013 be in the range of 15% to 17% of revenues and G&A in the range of 10% to 12% of revenues.  For the fourth quarter, we expect $3 milllion to $4 million of non-GAAP interest and other non-operating income including interest income and expense associated with our convertible debt. And for fiscal 2020, we expect non-GAAP interest in non-operating income of $16 million to $17 million. We expect the tax provision of approximately $1 million to $2 million for the fourth quarter and $5 million to $6 million for fiscal 2020. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 190 million to 195 million shares for Q4 and fiscal 2020.  In summary, we are off to a great start in the second half of fiscal 2020 and look-forward to executing on our strategic and financial goals. Thanks again for joining us today and we can now turn to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nPat Walravens : Okay, great, thank you very much and forgive the background noise and congratulations. Hey, Dan, do you mind commenting to start out just on sort of what you saw from a macro point of view, is there any weakness anywhere domestically or internationally. And then also I'd love to hear your thoughts on how the channels delivered during this quarter?\nDan Springer: Absolutely Pat. So from a macro standpoint, we haven't seen anything very different really across the geographies. One of the things we talk a lot about is \u2013 I'm not sure DocuSign will be the best bellwether for understanding economic change with our customers are such a high ROI with our product, that I think it would be not the initial sort of tax spending that would be cut, but we haven't seen anything really across any of the theaters in which we play different this quarter versus the last few quarters and we continue to think it's a strong market for our products and services.  And then from channel standpoint, we have a lot of very strong channel relationships with IFC players and interesting, we've also become much more focused on the partner side in terms of the [indiscernible] systems, integrators and we've seen good strength in both, particularly the progress we have in sort of going to market with systems integrators and I think that's really an indication of the Agreement Cloud overall sort of broadening and particularly on the DocuSign CLM side the original Spring\u2019s product, where it's sort of requires more of a statement of work and more integration opportunity there. So we're super excited about the progress there.\nPat Walravens : Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Ives: Yes, thanks. Can you talk about international in terms of what type of growth you're seeing there, I mean there's really feel like it's starting to inflect in terms of what you're seeing in the field? Thanks.\nMike Sheridan: Hi. I'll start. Yes, we saw good growth globally internationally grew over 40% again this quarter. So most of that of course, as you can imagine, I shouldn't say most, but a higher portion of that is new customer logos, it\u2019s the emerging markets compared to the U.S. where we had a lot of upsell contribution as well. In terms of CLM we're seeing good growth in the U.S. on CLM. We are also focusing internationally, but we haven't made as much traction internationally as we have domestically.\nDan Ives: Great. And then can you just talk maybe just from a sales cycle perspective, how things are changing, does you just feel more and more strategically in terms of how the type of conversations are going with enterprises, the upselling, so may be, obviously, we see the numbers, maybe you could just talk about it in terms of just type of conversations you're having with customers and now it's changing compared to let\u2019s say over the last three, six, nine months. Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yes, I think the vast majority. And remember our business is still eSignature heavy and so the vast majority that I don't think has changed, but we have seen changes, particularly in that mid-market and enterprise really to the nature of your question where people are asking for a broader conversation about the overall Agreement Cloud and as we talked about back at the beginning of this year, as expected that would, in some cases elongate those conversations and sales cycle but lead to larger overall deals. And I think we've seen that and we're seeing some nice uptick in areas like a dollar net retention because I think we're going to continue to have that opportunity to broaden and upsell there.  In terms of the conversations one thing is also interesting is it's a very beginning when we roll this out. We had the phenomenon that we had some sales cycles that were longer and were pushed into the next quarter, but now that we're a few quarters into this, we get some deals to get pushed from one quarter to the next and some to get pushed from this quarter out and then sort of netting each other out. So we feel like our ability to accurately understand and forecast that has improved, as we move through the year.\nDan Ives: Awesome. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks, quick question, how did you do in federal and how is the track and given the opportunity that you see there?\nDan Springer: So I think federal that continues to be one of the areas we spend a lot of time focused on, because we think it's a very big opportunity, we had last time a very exciting dramatic big ticket win. As we said, those will come from time-to-time, but really a lot like our core business we've always had in the past. It's more about that solid quarter-in quarter-out growing those core relationships.  One thing that we're quite excited about is we have the IL-4 investment that Mike talked a lot about and we now have that active. And our first customer is in fact using that platform, it's still early, it's not close to its full potential, but it's indicative, I think the progress we see there, the progress that we think we're going to continue to see in the vertical.\nSterling Auty: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So maybe just the first one, if I look at the Negotiate product that you announced at Dreamforce, maybe what's the opportunity set within your customer base, how big that opportunity to be to sell Negotiate and then, is there an opportunity to announce something similar with some of your other partners like SAP and I've got a quick follow-up.\nDan Springer: Yes. So I think Negotiate, if you think about it, we position that is the customer that says, I don't necessarily need entire CLM solution just the nature of my business from complexity or scale, it doesn't need that full capabilities so we built Negotiate just for those customers.  And I think we're really pleased with the initial reception we had at Dreamforce, when we were announcing it, there was just a very significant amount of demand for people to understand how they could leverage the partner from eSignature side, DocuSign that they love working with to take on a broader piece of their agreement cloud needs. So we feel good about that, that will necessarily as I said, be focused on that kind of mid-market and smaller, that\u2019s where we see the primary demand there. So there are large number of customers, but not our largest customers. If I think primarily what we\u2019ll see negotiate be successful. And then to answer your question, yes, absolutely, we want to continue to develop that capability across other partners. Keep in mind that CRM and specifically sort of the SFA portion where people are really managing their sales processes and their salesforce properties, that\u2019s one of the most important and obvious places where negotiate is very helpful. So we do think those are the partnerships, where it\u2019s going to be most common as a capability to people really want to add into their overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud Solution.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then Mike, just a question on the favorite topic of billings, obviously, different quarters kind of different dynamics with both pushes and pulls of deals or durations. Anything that you\u2019d comment on either as a headwind or tailwind for billings in the quarter and then how should we think about kind of as you look at next quarter with the guidance, any factors that we should consider from prior periods impacting there as well?\nMike Sheridan: Yes, I would tell you, Alex that billings this quarter and I would say for next quarter the dynamics are the same. There isn\u2019t any underlying changes in the business. If you look at Q1 to Q2 to Q3, you go 27 to 41 to 36 and as we\u2019ve talked about over time during the fourth quarter rolling average really gives you a better view and I think if you look at our guidance, it\u2019s consistent with that. So we\u2019ll continue to have that statistic subject to fluctuations that have nothing to do with growth can have more to do with timing. And I think if I look at Q3, it\u2019s a quarter where it was pretty consistent in terms of impact of those kinds of timing factors.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey guys, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Wanted to come back to international because of very impressive results there. Within international, which geographies are you guys seeing the most traction and I have a quick follow-up for Mike.\nDan Springer: Yes. My perspective internationally it\u2019s actually been strong sort of across the board. There are definitely areas where you\u2019ll see us talk more in the coming year about our investments in our focus areas where you will see, where we see that enthusiasm. But I think what you\u2019re going to see is sort of the same strategy we\u2019ve had in the past which is we want to focus on a core set of countries, as you know, we initially had most of our success in the common law countries like the U.S., UK, Australia, Canada. Now, we\u2019re actually seeing in the common \u2013 but now the civil law on top of that. So that places like France and Germany and Brazil and Japan that same sort of market traction. So I think our view is it\u2019s consistent across the board and I don\u2019t know Mike if you have any different perspective on it, but I think that\u2019s how we look at the international.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. And then Mike, just a quick one more sanity check on favorite topic of billings. Following up on Alex\u2019s question, was FX, an impact on billings in the quarter and on net revenue retention, a very nice 117% result there. How should we think about net revenue retention heading into Q4 and beyond? Thank you.\nMike Sheridan: Yes, Stan. So \u2013 on FX not really any material impact or trending change on that. The 117%, we\u2019re very happy with that I\u2019ve mentioned a couple of the contributing factors. I also mentioned the range and as I\u2019ve said in prior quarters, I think right now, our business is at is we\u2019re going to continue to perform somewhere in those mid-teens, that we can have strong quarters where it takes a bit up, quarters where it\u2019s a little bit less than that. But overall, right in that range. We feel very good about it and I think it\u2019s a proof point for us that being able to offer this broader portfolio of products is starting to gain some traction for us.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to maybe ask higher level in terms of the idea of verticalization of your solutions, you\u2019ve obviously gotten a lot on the real estate and mortgage side, more is proof-of-concept than being a massive vertical in terms of revenue. Just wanted to get a sense for how you\u2019re thinking about future potential for verticalization to kind of increase your footprint and verticals that you may not have a massive footprint in today and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nDan Springer: Yes. So I think first and foremost, Rishi, this is a horizontal software platform and it is going to be a horizontal software platform at its core for years to come. And that\u2019s not is just specific to eSignature. But I think that really applies across the overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud. That said, you\u2019re absolutely right. We had certain verticals, which have been very successful for us. We\u2019ve had certain verticals where we have done additional software development, healthcare life sciences is a great example where we\u2019ve actually looked at opportunities to develop very specific use cases and specific software around CFR Part 11 for the sort of drug development side of that business. But I think in general what you\u2019re going to see us continue to focus on how we go-to-market with verticals and how we build, not so much additional separate software, but all the other components around go-to-market and that could be our services, are working with systems integrators to really bring broader solutions to the verticals. And in terms of your question about sort of additional new verticals, we\u2019re pretty broadly placed in the market today. We talked a little earlier on the call about government as a vertical in particularly federal, which is one that was not a large opportunity for us prior pre FedRAMP and IL4. So that\u2019s to be an example of a vertical where we would see I think additional growth opportunity that might be substantial relative to the piece we have today. But again, I really would focus you on the construct of, it\u2019s a horizontal platform and that\u2019s how we really want to be built in this business going forward.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on Pat\u2019s earlier question just about on the macro side, just wondering in terms of customer buying behavior. We\u2019ve heard a couple SaaS companies during this past earnings season highlight that they\u2019ve seen customers maybe shifting more to monthly versus annual. I know you disclosed average contract length and it\u2019s been typically in 18 months to 19 months on a dollar weighted basis. So no changes on the numbers that we can on the outside, but I just wanted to get a sense of is that anything that you\u2019re seeing customers preferring to not prepay more in advance or anything like that. Thanks.\nDan Springer: We really haven\u2019t. As to your point to the earlier macro question, believe me, it\u2019s something we talk about. We meet with our sales leaders, we try to understand if we see something in the marketplace, it\u2019s different. I hope it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have our finger on the pulse. I think we do, but we\u2019re just, we\u2019re not seeing anything of any significance and specifically as you said, when you look at the contract period that haven\u2019t changed in any significant way. So at this point, Mike if you have anything else to add and my view is we\u2019re really not seeing anything impactful to our business in the macro environment.\nMike Sheridan: Yes, just to summarize, I think that if you look at the underlying billing patterns in the business today, they haven\u2019t changed. I do think that there are customers that would like to push forward monthly or quarterly billings. We don\u2019t really allow for that in the model but for rare cases. And just as a reminder, where we do have multi-year deals we still bill those out annually. So the duration in the business has been pretty stable.\nRishi Jaluria: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Hi, a question for Mike. I\u2019d like to ask you about the seasonality of billings. It\u2019s not uncommon for SaaS companies. When you start moving past $1 billion in revs to start seeing a little bit more of a traditional 4Q SKU, when I look at your billings guide for this year as a percentage of total year billings, it\u2019s like to the decimal point exactly the same, 32.6% as you put up last 4Q. So I\u2019m just curious when I know you\u2019re not going to give us billings guidance for fiscal 2021 on this call. But when we model the seasonality similar slightly different bit more of a 4Q SKU next year, any comment, Mike.\nMike Sheridan: I would say Karl, nothing if \u2013 that would look like an inflection change. I think you\u2019re right, the natural tenancy of the SaaS business over time is to have sort of a growing influence of the underlying seasonality, and we will probably see that going forward, but I wouldn\u2019t make any dramatic changes from what you saw this year.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. And Mike could I ask a follow-up. I\u2019m sorry, you went through it a little quickly, but do you mind going back to that 117% net retention number, because I think that\u2019s significant and the highest number you\u2019ve posted since you went public. Do you mind just repeating the factors that contributed to that and why that wouldn\u2019t be a leading indicator that we should be paying attention to?\nMike Sheridan: Well. I do think it\u2019s a very strong indicator. I wouldn\u2019t want you to think that it\u2019s not something to pay attention to. That\u2019s why we spend a fair amount of time discussing it. What I said was \u2013 really this quarter was strong and the biggest contributors to that strength is we were particularly strong in our upsells in North America. And in North America, particularly in our commercial business was just a very good quarter for us. In addition to that, as I mentioned in the U.S. primarily, we also saw good continued traction increasing with upsells of CLM into the installed base. So those combined had a tick up. I think just from an expectation standpoint as you\u2019ve seen in the last several quarters, we continue to reiterate that range of 112% and 119%. And within that you can have strong quarters and not as strong quarters, all fall within what we consider to be the norm. My view right now is the business what we have visibility into is that it should stabilize somewhere in those mid-teen kind of ranges of performance and we continue to believe that.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And congrats on the good upsell performance.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much and I\u2019ll add my congrats on the quarter. Dan, were there any commonalities when you look across the customer base that\u2019s taking on the CLM product at this point in time, meaning any verticals that are may be more willing to take that or more interest in that product today. And I\u2019d just be interested also within those kind of upsell opportunities or frankly just sales opportunities. Are you going in that sort of a higher level within the customer meaning to those become more maybe seed level discussions or at least had the business discussions may be versus where you sell the eSignature product originally. Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yes. So a couple of thoughts. I wouldn\u2019t say there is something dramatic from a vertical standpoint. We do see the demand across some of our big verticals, telecom, financial services, government and we really see a very broad-based demand for CLM capabilities, the place that it's different maybe than our broader eSignature mix, it does tend to be focused on people that have some sort of process, either in the sales process, which is probably the area we see most common one of the areas with negotiate we did, as I mentioned earlier, build that out for the Salesforce ecosystem first because of their strength in CRM. But it's, yes it's less about vertical and more about that business process. And then to your second question about how we go-to-market and where we sell in. I think it's very similar to the customer set that we would speak to about our traditional signature product. But I think your insight about maybe being sometimes a little more senior that can be the case because you oftentimes have to work with multiple groups. We've talked about this before the CIO, like get more engaged because there is a biggest \u2013 bigger integration effort or there could be from a systems integration standpoint, a professional service component with FFW, and that might involve an additional aspect of legal or CIO to kind of be reviewing that so because we get a little broader and talk to a few more people. I think that might slightly push us higher in the organization, but I wouldn't want to give you a sense that it's significantly different. I think it really is those core leaders of businesses, business units or functions that are looking to modernize their System of Agreement, and that's why they're talking to DocuSign.\nKirk Materne: That's helpful. And then Mike one really quick one for you on this sort of cash flow and cash flow yield and maybe how we should think about that going forward. I realize you had the settlement in this quarter, but should cash flow yield over sort of the longer-term mimic essentially operating margins for the most part, it was there anything, I guess we should think about that would create a gap between that sort of progress on a year-over-year basis going forward, I don't \u2013 I don't want to be too specific about right now on next year, but just anything we should consider as we sort of think about next year and cash flow for next year? Thanks.\nMike Sheridan: Yes, I would say that you know just to reiterate what we stated in the past, we think we're on track on the long-term target model of 20% to 25% operating margin. I think the way to think about cash flow is that over time, it should precede that just because we are a SaaS-subscription business and we do bills as we were talking about before upfront. So yes, you would expect that there would be a lag on the operating margin which is the legacy indicator of revenue and then the cash flow percentage should come in overall above that.\nKirk Materne: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, thank you for taking my question. And like everyone also echo my congrats on this fantastic quarter and job there. I wanted to touch first on the analytics product. You've talked about using the data to offer analytics and you know lots of SaaS companies have. I just love to understand the timeline for the opportunity and sort of potential use cases. How do you think about that and actually, more importantly, what does that do to your TAM? So a couple of questions there and I got a quick follow-up.\nDan Springer: Yes, so let me start off when we talk about the analytics, to be clear, there's really as your question indicated multiple components of it, so we have an analytics offerings that are around what I would really say on reporting, these are not advanced analysis and helping people the administrators that use DocuSign understand their usage, understand where in the organization people are effectively using DocuSign and that's a very operational component. Then we have opportunities where people start to say this information is contained in my agreements is valuable for potentially running my business better and we have the opportunity for people to extract information about their agreements and again help them run their core business better and that's what we're getting now. What I would really call our analytics type product. And then we do partner effectively with Seal, the company that we've made an investment in to do what we would call advanced search capability or Intelligent search capability. Where people now have the ability, as they think about their overall sort of the System of Agreement they're trying to manage with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud and that gives them the ability to say, I can get very significant information about my business and about my agreements, one of the examples we like to use that's been very prevalent for some of our bank customers if they had agreements that were done on LIBOR they now realize they got to go and then was labor going away, go back and find all those agreements and recast them and this gives them an ability to really quickly and efficiently find access to that, that would be again a more advanced analytics. So, we look at it across all of those different components and we think that increasingly our customers are saying there is tremendous value in getting knowledge about an information out of our agreement, and that will, I think continue to be a growth area for us.\nBhavan Suri: Got it. Got it. The contract sort of management in understanding what's in contracts, I think it\u2019s critical. The number of guys deal, obviously, one of the legal side write a docs on the manufacturing side but sort of thinking about these contract and documents and what you have to do with them, your ability to sort of pull that together, it\u2019s very powerful. One last quick one, maybe [indiscernible] on competition here, any changes to the competitive environment? Are you seeing more of Hellosign after the Dropbox acquisition? Just anything you're seeing over there that's you're seeing over there that's changed or maybe different in the credit environment? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yes, we don't have anything new for you uncompetitive Mike and I do with thoughtful review all the time but particularly before we get on this call. So we can be thoughtful and giving you guys any indication or something different in the marketplace, but as we talk to our sellers, we haven't seen any change really across the year. We continue to be very focused on trying to understand what we see competitors doing in general, when we see competitive pressure it's not about someone having a solution or offering it's better than DocuSign, it's about people coming in at a much lower cost and trying to find folks that might be willing to flip for a dramatically lower cost. So that's unchanged and I would say that the competitive dynamics are very similar to have they been throughout the whole year.\nBhavan Suri: Awesome. Helpful guys. Thank you so much and congrats.\nDan Springer: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJacqueline Cheong: Hi, this is actually Jacqueline Cheong on for Kash. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. I noticed that sales efficiency as measured by sales and marketing over incremental revenues have been in the $1.9 million to $2.0 million range for some time. And this quarter you guys actually improved significantly to $1.7 million. So can you talk a bit about what caused the improvement?\nMike Sheridan: Yes. Hi, Jack, when I think it's, it is all the factors we've been talking about for some time, which is over time, of course, you know as our sales force improves down the learning curve of things like DocuSign CLM for example and some of these other new elements to the business. We're going to be driving better leverage in the sales organization. If you look at the fact that some of our markets, I mentioned before, our newer markets are going to be more weighted towards newer customers than upsells just because we're earlier in those markets statistics like that we'll have a mix of various contributors, depending upon how long we've been in a particular space or a particular product. So I wouldn't want you to come away thinking that it is sort of this monolithic statistic that applies to everything equally that statistic it look a little bit better in a more mature market like U.S., it will look a little bit earlier in markets like, for example of Brazil or a country like that. But overall, our focus is on continuing to improve the productivity of our salesforce through offering new technologies that they can bring in, then moving down the learning curve. All of those \u2013 all those elements that I think combined to improve the leverage over time towards what we think that target model long-term is a 35% to 40% of revenue type model.\nJacqueline Cheong: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Wells with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Wells: Thanks for taking my question. So you added 5,000 commercial \u2013 enterprise customers in the quarter on the backdrop of a net retention rate of 117% both of which look like all time highs. Was there any change in the average deal size in the quarter on a year-over-year basis? Are these new customers landing at smaller ACVs and I have a quick follow-up.\nDan Springer: I don't think there's anything at all significant in deal sizes. I think the reason we're hitting \u2013 the records is that we continue to grow as the business and I think our expectation, as you think about the guidance for Q4, we will also continue to grow and have that kind of performance. So I don't think there's anything that's different to make up there.\nMike Sheridan: Yes, I think in any particular quarter anecdotally you can have one quarter have a little bit stronger performance in larger enterprises, other quarters have a bit of a stronger performance in commercial. But on a blend, I totally agree with Dan and if you look at our overall diversification among customers, we don't have a customer that makes up even 2% of our revenue, so that continues to be true.\nMatthew Wells: Thanks. That's helpful. And was SpringCM included in the year-over-year expansion figure? Or is this pure e-sign expansion?\nMike Sheridan: It's included in both this quarter because this is the first quarter where we had it in fiscal 2019 numbers as well as fiscal 2020 numbers for Q3.\nMatthew Wells: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call over to management for final comments.\nDan Springer: Thank you all very much for joining us. We'll look forward to seeing you out on the road and talking to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dan and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder, our non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of debt discount and employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions. Also having acquired SpringCM in September last year, this is the first quarter that will include SpringCM in comparable periods from a year ago. Our Third quarter results reflect solid execution, delivering strong top line growth and profitability while continuing to drive customer success. Total revenue rose 40% year-over-year to $250 million and subscription revenue grew 41% to $238 million. Total international revenue grew over 40% year-over-year to $43 million. Total billings increased 36% year-over-year to $269 million, on a four-quarter rolling average basis billings growth was 35%. Strong demand from our core eSignature solutions coupled with growing adoption of our broader portfolio of Agreement Cloud products continued this quarter. We added approximately 25,000 new customers this quarter, 5,000 of which were direct customers. This drove a 30% year-over-year increase in our commercial and enterprise installed base. This brings our total customer base to 562,000 with roughly 69,000 direct customers worldwide. We saw notable strength in upsells into our installed base with particularly strong contribution from our North American business. We also continue to see progress in upsells of DocuSign CLM into our installed base. The combination of these factors increased our dollar net retention to 117% this quarter, within our historical range of 112% to 119%. Customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 41% year-over-year to a total of 401 customers. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 79% consistent with a year ago. Subscription gross margin was 84% compared with 85% a year ago. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $180 million or 72% of total revenue compared with $142 million or 80% of total revenue for the third quarter of last year. With the settlement of the RPost litigation G&A returned to more normalized levels in the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was $17 million or 7% operating margin in Q3. This compares to a $1 million non-GAAP operating loss or a negative 1% operating margin in Q3 of fiscal 2019. We ended the quarter with 3,723 employees, a year-over-year increase of 28%. Operating cash flow was negative $2 million as we paid out the RPost settlement in the third quarter, this compares with a positive $4 million in Q3 of last year. Free cash flow came in at negative $14 million, compared to negative $4 million in the prior year. As anticipated, the RPost litigation payment together with planned real estate investments, including our office in Dublin and our Fed datacenter impacted our cash flow in the quarter. Turning to our guidance we estimate first, revenue of $263 million to $267million in Q4 and $962 million to $966 million for fiscal 2020. In addition, we expect billings of $346 million to $356 million in Q4 and $1.083 billion to $1.093 billion for fiscal 2020. We are maintaining our guidance for non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80% for Q4 in fiscal 2020. For Q4 and fiscal 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses, we are maintaining our guidance of sales and marketing in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues or in the \u2013 be in the range of 15% to 17% of revenues and G&A in the range of 10% to 12% of revenues.  For the fourth quarter, we expect $3 milllion to $4 million of non-GAAP interest and other non-operating income including interest income and expense associated with our convertible debt. And for fiscal 2020, we expect non-GAAP interest in non-operating income of $16 million to $17 million. We expect the tax provision of approximately $1 million to $2 million for the fourth quarter and $5 million to $6 million for fiscal 2020. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 190 million to 195 million shares for Q4 and fiscal 2020.  In summary, we are off to a great start in the second half of fiscal 2020 and look-forward to executing on our strategic and financial goals. Thanks again for joining us today and we can now turn to Q&A. Hi. I'll start. Yes, we saw good growth globally internationally grew over 40% again this quarter. So most of that of course, as you can imagine, I shouldn't say most, but a higher portion of that is new customer logos, it's the emerging markets compared to the U.S. where we had a lot of upsell contribution as well. In terms of CLM we're seeing good growth in the U.S. on CLM. We are also focusing internationally, but we haven't made as much traction internationally as we have domestically. Yes, I would tell you, Alex that billings this quarter and I would say for next quarter the dynamics are the same. There isn't any underlying changes in the business. If you look at Q1 to Q2 to Q3, you go 27 to 41 to 36 and as we've talked about over time during the fourth quarter rolling average really gives you a better view and I think if you look at our guidance, it's consistent with that. So we'll continue to have that statistic subject to fluctuations that have nothing to do with growth can have more to do with timing. And I think if I look at Q3, it's a quarter where it was pretty consistent in terms of impact of those kinds of timing factors. Yes, Stan. So \u2013 on FX not really any material impact or trending change on that. The 117%, we're very happy with that I've mentioned a couple of the contributing factors. I also mentioned the range and as I've said in prior quarters, I think right now, our business is at is we're going to continue to perform somewhere in those mid-teens, that we can have strong quarters where it takes a bit up, quarters where it's a little bit less than that. But overall, right in that range. We feel very good about it and I think it's a proof point for us that being able to offer this broader portfolio of products is starting to gain some traction for us. Yes, just to summarize, I think that if you look at the underlying billing patterns in the business today, they haven't changed. I do think that there are customers that would like to push forward monthly or quarterly billings. We don't really allow for that in the model but for rare cases. And just as a reminder, where we do have multi-year deals we still bill those out annually. So the duration in the business has been pretty stable. I would say Karl, nothing if \u2013 that would look like an inflection change. I think you're right, the natural tenancy of the SaaS business over time is to have sort of a growing influence of the underlying seasonality, and we will probably see that going forward, but I wouldn't make any dramatic changes from what you saw this year. Well. I do think it's a very strong indicator. I wouldn't want you to think that it's not something to pay attention to. That's why we spend a fair amount of time discussing it. What I said was \u2013 really this quarter was strong and the biggest contributors to that strength is we were particularly strong in our upsells in North America. And in North America, particularly in our commercial business was just a very good quarter for us. In addition to that, as I mentioned in the U.S. primarily, we also saw good continued traction increasing with upsells of CLM into the installed base. So those combined had a tick up. I think just from an expectation standpoint as you've seen in the last several quarters, we continue to reiterate that range of 112% and 119%. And within that you can have strong quarters and not as strong quarters, all fall within what we consider to be the norm. My view right now is the business what we have visibility into is that it should stabilize somewhere in those mid-teen kind of ranges of performance and we continue to believe that. Yes, I would say that you know just to reiterate what we stated in the past, we think we're on track on the long-term target model of 20% to 25% operating margin. I think the way to think about cash flow is that over time, it should precede that just because we are a SaaS-subscription business and we do bills as we were talking about before upfront. So yes, you would expect that there would be a lag on the operating margin which is the legacy indicator of revenue and then the cash flow percentage should come in overall above that. Yes. Hi, Jack, when I think it's, it is all the factors we've been talking about for some time, which is over time, of course, you know as our sales force improves down the learning curve of things like DocuSign CLM for example and some of these other new elements to the business. We're going to be driving better leverage in the sales organization. If you look at the fact that some of our markets, I mentioned before, our newer markets are going to be more weighted towards newer customers than upsells just because we're earlier in those markets statistics like that we'll have a mix of various contributors, depending upon how long we've been in a particular space or a particular product. So I wouldn't want you to come away thinking that it is sort of this monolithic statistic that applies to everything equally that statistic it look a little bit better in a more mature market like U.S., it will look a little bit earlier in markets like, for example of Brazil or a country like that. But overall, our focus is on continuing to improve the productivity of our salesforce through offering new technologies that they can bring in, then moving down the learning curve. All of those \u2013 all those elements that I think combined to improve the leverage over time towards what we think that target model long-term is a 35% to 40% of revenue type model. Yes, I think in any particular quarter anecdotally you can have one quarter have a little bit stronger performance in larger enterprises, other quarters have a bit of a stronger performance in commercial. But on a blend, I totally agree with Dan and if you look at our overall diversification among customers, we don't have a customer that makes up even 2% of our revenue, so that continues to be true. It's included in both this quarter because this is the first quarter where we had it in fiscal 2019 numbers as well as fiscal 2020 numbers for Q3."

            "content": "Thanks, Anne and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to start today with some brief updates on two areas of our business, one, our positive financial results for the third quarter and how we are driving demand for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud led by our core eSignature offering; two, a quick recap of our vision and strategy since going public last year and how we've continued to execute against that for Q3. I will then hand it over to Mike for a deeper discussion our financials, after which we can open up for Q&A. So first, let me start with some comments on our third quarter. As many of you know, DocuSign's growth is driven by three primary factors, increased adoption and use case expansion within our existing customer base, the acquisition of new customers and the development of new solutions that help companies modernize their systems of agreement. We believe our Q3 results reflect ongoing progress across all of those factors. With strong demand for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud we grew revenue by 40% year-over-year to $250 million and billings by 36% year-over-year to $269 million. We acquired 25,000 new customers, approximately 5,000 of which were direct, bringing our total number of paying customers to 562,000 worldwide, of which roughly 69,000 are direct. We were again profitable on a non-GAAP basis with operating income of nearly $17 million and this is our eighth consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP EPS. We also saw a solid uptick in our dollar net retention rate to 117%, these positive results showcase the demand for our agreement cloud suite remains strong as we head into our largest quarter of the year.  Next, I'd like to share how we are progressing on the vision and strategy we laid out, when we went public last year and how we continue to execute in Q3. By now, you're probably familiar with our Agreement Cloud vision. It builds on top of our global eSignature leadership and helps companies automate and connect their agreement processes, both before and after signature takes place. We first discussed this during our IPO. And at that time, we reinforced the importance of our core eSignature business and clearly articulated the $25 billion opportunity which is still only about 5% penetrated. We also showed how that TAM could potentially double with the expanded opportunity for the rest of the Agreement Cloud. Over the past 18 months, we've taken several steps to deliver on that vision. We acquired SpringCM in September last year and we have integrated its technology and talent into our product line and operations. Our own product development team built and delivered several new agreement cloud solutions and we partnered with specialist companies to resell select additional products that expand on our offering. We then brought all this together under the agreement cloud umbrella. Our suite of more than a dozen products now and over 350 prebuilt integration that helps organizations connect and automate their agreement processes. We also collaborate with systems integrators like ATG, Simplest and Spalding Rich, who are building out Agreement Cloud practices and broadening our ability to drive success for our joint customers. And amid all of this we have continued to enhance the functionality of our core eSignature offering, with features like responsive signing, where the Agreement automatically adapts it's formatting to the size and type of the device that the signer is using. In Q3 we continued this momentum by announcing two new agreement cloud products, the first is DocuSign negotiate, it helps companies that don't yet need full blown CLM to simplify and accelerate the process of generating, redlining and negotiating agreements, we just launched the initial version in November and is optimized specifically for the salesforce ecosystem. The second is DocuSign CLM. This is the next generation of Spring CM flagship product, it includes all the capabilities of DocuSign negotiate plus an end-to-end workflow builder, a centralized contract repository and a clause library, it is targeted an upper mid-market and enterprise customers. But we're still in the early stages of our Agreement Cloud journey. We are pleased with our progress to date. By expanding our portfolio we're motivating customers to automate more of their agreement processes which in turn drive even more eSignature. This virtuous cycle is illustrated by some interesting customer expansions we had in Q3. One of the global leaders in the ridesharing base has used both DocuSign eSignature and CLM in their sales, HR and business operations for many years. Building on that success, the company expanded its use of CLM in Q3 to coverage departments for commercial transactions, emerging technology and legal. This significantly increased the size of our commercial relationship. Additionally, a large U.S. credit union increased its eSignature usage by 300% this year and in Q3 also made a commitment to use our API to integrate eSignature into its other systems. This company plans to expand eSignature to 10 additional business units next year and we'll also evaluate using DocuSign CLM for potential implementation. A mobile analytics company expanded its use of eSignature into HR, leveraging our integration with the recruiting software provider greenhouse. This is a great example of how the Agreement Cloud integration drives departmental expense, which in turn drives revenue from greater usage. So as I bring my remarks to a close, I want to reiterate, when we went public, we had a strong eSignature business and a vision to expand our offerings for the entire agreement process, we have executed on that vision and the customer response has been strong. Based on our progress, I believe we are in a unique position to create and be a leader in the next big platform category Agreement Cloud. But just before I hand over to Mike, I also wanted to share two quick executive team updates. The first is that our Chief Product Officer, Ron Hirson, will be taking a mid-career break to focus on a health issue in his family. Ron and I have talked about this transition at great length and he's going to stay with us through the middle of next year. Even though we're incredibly sad to see him leave, we support his decision, we really appreciate his incredible impact during his six-year tenure. And we're proud of the team he's built to continue the innovation at DocuSign. Second update is our creation of a new Chief Trust and Security Officer role, which former United Airlines CISO Emily Heath is taking on. Emily has an incredible pedigree in the InfoSec industry and she will oversee information security, application and physical security, and trust services for the company out of our San Francisco office. We're thrilled to have someone of Emily's pedigree join us in this vital role. So that's it for me. Thanks for joining us today. And now Mike will walk you through the Q3 financials. Absolutely Pat. So from a macro standpoint, we haven't seen anything very different really across the geographies. One of the things we talk a lot about is \u2013 I'm not sure DocuSign will be the best bellwether for understanding economic change with our customers are such a high ROI with our product, that I think it would be not the initial sort of tax spending that would be cut, but we haven't seen anything really across any of the theaters in which we play different this quarter versus the last few quarters and we continue to think it's a strong market for our products and services.  And then from channel standpoint, we have a lot of very strong channel relationships with IFC players and interesting, we've also become much more focused on the partner side in terms of the [indiscernible] systems, integrators and we've seen good strength in both, particularly the progress we have in sort of going to market with systems integrators and I think that's really an indication of the Agreement Cloud overall sort of broadening and particularly on the DocuSign CLM side the original Spring's product, where it's sort of requires more of a statement of work and more integration opportunity there. So we're super excited about the progress there. Yes, I think the vast majority. And remember our business is still eSignature heavy and so the vast majority that I don't think has changed, but we have seen changes, particularly in that mid-market and enterprise really to the nature of your question where people are asking for a broader conversation about the overall Agreement Cloud and as we talked about back at the beginning of this year, as expected that would, in some cases elongate those conversations and sales cycle but lead to larger overall deals. And I think we've seen that and we're seeing some nice uptick in areas like a dollar net retention because I think we're going to continue to have that opportunity to broaden and upsell there.  In terms of the conversations one thing is also interesting is it's a very beginning when we roll this out. We had the phenomenon that we had some sales cycles that were longer and were pushed into the next quarter, but now that we're a few quarters into this, we get some deals to get pushed from one quarter to the next and some to get pushed from this quarter out and then sort of netting each other out. So we feel like our ability to accurately understand and forecast that has improved, as we move through the year. So I think federal that continues to be one of the areas we spend a lot of time focused on, because we think it's a very big opportunity, we had last time a very exciting dramatic big ticket win. As we said, those will come from time-to-time, but really a lot like our core business we've always had in the past. It's more about that solid quarter-in quarter-out growing those core relationships.  One thing that we're quite excited about is we have the IL-4 investment that Mike talked a lot about and we now have that active. And our first customer is in fact using that platform, it's still early, it's not close to its full potential, but it's indicative, I think the progress we see there, the progress that we think we're going to continue to see in the vertical. Yes. So I think Negotiate, if you think about it, we position that is the customer that says, I don't necessarily need entire CLM solution just the nature of my business from complexity or scale, it doesn't need that full capabilities so we built Negotiate just for those customers.  And I think we're really pleased with the initial reception we had at Dreamforce, when we were announcing it, there was just a very significant amount of demand for people to understand how they could leverage the partner from eSignature side, DocuSign that they love working with to take on a broader piece of their agreement cloud needs. So we feel good about that, that will necessarily as I said, be focused on that kind of mid-market and smaller, that's where we see the primary demand there. So there are large number of customers, but not our largest customers. If I think primarily what we'll see negotiate be successful. And then to answer your question, yes, absolutely, we want to continue to develop that capability across other partners. Keep in mind that CRM and specifically sort of the SFA portion where people are really managing their sales processes and their salesforce properties, that's one of the most important and obvious places where negotiate is very helpful. So we do think those are the partnerships, where it's going to be most common as a capability to people really want to add into their overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud Solution. Yes. My perspective internationally it's actually been strong sort of across the board. There are definitely areas where you'll see us talk more in the coming year about our investments in our focus areas where you will see, where we see that enthusiasm. But I think what you're going to see is sort of the same strategy we've had in the past which is we want to focus on a core set of countries, as you know, we initially had most of our success in the common law countries like the U.S., UK, Australia, Canada. Now, we're actually seeing in the common \u2013 but now the civil law on top of that. So that places like France and Germany and Brazil and Japan that same sort of market traction. So I think our view is it's consistent across the board and I don't know Mike if you have any different perspective on it, but I think that's how we look at the international. Yes. So I think first and foremost, Rishi, this is a horizontal software platform and it is going to be a horizontal software platform at its core for years to come. And that's not is just specific to eSignature. But I think that really applies across the overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud. That said, you're absolutely right. We had certain verticals, which have been very successful for us. We've had certain verticals where we have done additional software development, healthcare life sciences is a great example where we've actually looked at opportunities to develop very specific use cases and specific software around CFR Part 11 for the sort of drug development side of that business. But I think in general what you're going to see us continue to focus on how we go-to-market with verticals and how we build, not so much additional separate software, but all the other components around go-to-market and that could be our services, are working with systems integrators to really bring broader solutions to the verticals. And in terms of your question about sort of additional new verticals, we're pretty broadly placed in the market today. We talked a little earlier on the call about government as a vertical in particularly federal, which is one that was not a large opportunity for us prior pre FedRAMP and IL4. So that's to be an example of a vertical where we would see I think additional growth opportunity that might be substantial relative to the piece we have today. But again, I really would focus you on the construct of, it's a horizontal platform and that's how we really want to be built in this business going forward. We really haven't. As to your point to the earlier macro question, believe me, it's something we talk about. We meet with our sales leaders, we try to understand if we see something in the marketplace, it's different. I hope it's not that we don't have our finger on the pulse. I think we do, but we're just, we're not seeing anything of any significance and specifically as you said, when you look at the contract period that haven't changed in any significant way. So at this point, Mike if you have anything else to add and my view is we're really not seeing anything impactful to our business in the macro environment. Yes. So a couple of thoughts. I wouldn't say there is something dramatic from a vertical standpoint. We do see the demand across some of our big verticals, telecom, financial services, government and we really see a very broad-based demand for CLM capabilities, the place that it's different maybe than our broader eSignature mix, it does tend to be focused on people that have some sort of process, either in the sales process, which is probably the area we see most common one of the areas with negotiate we did, as I mentioned earlier, build that out for the Salesforce ecosystem first because of their strength in CRM. But it's, yes it's less about vertical and more about that business process. And then to your second question about how we go-to-market and where we sell in. I think it's very similar to the customer set that we would speak to about our traditional signature product. But I think your insight about maybe being sometimes a little more senior that can be the case because you oftentimes have to work with multiple groups. We've talked about this before the CIO, like get more engaged because there is a biggest \u2013 bigger integration effort or there could be from a systems integration standpoint, a professional service component with FFW, and that might involve an additional aspect of legal or CIO to kind of be reviewing that so because we get a little broader and talk to a few more people. I think that might slightly push us higher in the organization, but I wouldn't want to give you a sense that it's significantly different. I think it really is those core leaders of businesses, business units or functions that are looking to modernize their System of Agreement, and that's why they're talking to DocuSign. Yes, so let me start off when we talk about the analytics, to be clear, there's really as your question indicated multiple components of it, so we have an analytics offerings that are around what I would really say on reporting, these are not advanced analysis and helping people the administrators that use DocuSign understand their usage, understand where in the organization people are effectively using DocuSign and that's a very operational component. Then we have opportunities where people start to say this information is contained in my agreements is valuable for potentially running my business better and we have the opportunity for people to extract information about their agreements and again help them run their core business better and that's what we're getting now. What I would really call our analytics type product. And then we do partner effectively with Seal, the company that we've made an investment in to do what we would call advanced search capability or Intelligent search capability. Where people now have the ability, as they think about their overall sort of the System of Agreement they're trying to manage with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud and that gives them the ability to say, I can get very significant information about my business and about my agreements, one of the examples we like to use that's been very prevalent for some of our bank customers if they had agreements that were done on LIBOR they now realize they got to go and then was labor going away, go back and find all those agreements and recast them and this gives them an ability to really quickly and efficiently find access to that, that would be again a more advanced analytics. So, we look at it across all of those different components and we think that increasingly our customers are saying there is tremendous value in getting knowledge about an information out of our agreement, and that will, I think continue to be a growth area for us. Yes, we don't have anything new for you uncompetitive Mike and I do with thoughtful review all the time but particularly before we get on this call. So we can be thoughtful and giving you guys any indication or something different in the marketplace, but as we talk to our sellers, we haven't seen any change really across the year. We continue to be very focused on trying to understand what we see competitors doing in general, when we see competitive pressure it's not about someone having a solution or offering it's better than DocuSign, it's about people coming in at a much lower cost and trying to find folks that might be willing to flip for a dramatically lower cost. So that's unchanged and I would say that the competitive dynamics are very similar to have they been throughout the whole year. Thank you. I don't think there's anything at all significant in deal sizes. I think the reason we're hitting \u2013 the records is that we continue to grow as the business and I think our expectation, as you think about the guidance for Q4, we will also continue to grow and have that kind of performance. So I don't think there's anything that's different to make up there. Thank you all very much for joining us. We'll look forward to seeing you out on the road and talking to you next quarter. Thank you."

For information, on our non-GAAP financial information, the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a quantitative reconciliation of those figures, please refer to today's press release. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings call. Today, I'm going to cover three sections: Our high level financial results and how we are driving strong growth; an update our Agreement Cloud vision, and how our strength in eSignature is the perfect on-ramp to expanded relationship with our customers; and finally, how we are rapidly delivering innovative solution to support the Agreement Cloud vision. I'll then pass it over to Mike for a more detailed rundown of our financials. Together, we believe it will showcase the strength in our existing business and the incredible potential for the future. So, let me start with our results and our commitment to growth. As part of our overall strategy, DocuSign has three main growth drivers, which you've heard me talk about before. One, acquire new customers; two, expand usage and use cases within existing customers; and finally, three, introduce innovative solutions to help customers modernize new parts of their Systems of Agreement. In this quarter, we saw progress on all three fronts. We acquired 29,000 new customers, approximately 4,000 of which are direct, bringing our total number of paying customers to 537,000 worldwide; 64,000 of those are direct. With strong consumer demand for our products within the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, we grew our revenues 41% year-over-year to $236 million and billings 47% year-over-year to $252 million. Expansion of eSignature volume and use cases was evident in our net dollar retention rate of 113%. These results reflect solid progress for our second quarter and they support our confidence in and our excitement for future. Next, I'd like to update you on our Agreement Cloud vision and our success with new product development there. Earlier this year, we introduced DocuSign Agreement Cloud. It is the umbrella for our suite of more than a dozen products and over 350 prebuilt integrations, all to help organizations connect and automate the entire agreement process from preparing, to signing, acting on and managing their agreements. This quarter, we saw particularly strong progress from the CLM product that came via our acquisition of SpringCM. CLM stands for contract lifecycle management, a term we will increasingly use as we transition the SpringCM product name to DocuSign CLM. Of course, we're still doing plenty of deals for our core eSignature solution by itself. And we believe this $25 billion market opportunity is still largely untapped. Moreover, we view nearly every eSignature win as the basis for future expansion to other Agreement Cloud products. We've begun to see multiple examples of how customers are connecting and automating various stages of the agreement process, while continuing to expand their eSignature use cases. One of the world's largest energy companies is currently using eSignature and CLM together for generating, negotiating and signing sales agreements. With their deployment of the Agreement Cloud integrated with their instances of Salesforce, Microsoft SharePoint, and SAP, they now can complete agreements that used to take days or weeks in as little as two minutes. The efficiency improvements they've seen with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud are saving the company tens of millions of dollars, and have the potential to save even more. Another customer, a cloud payroll services company, not only expanded on their core signature usage as they brought more internal processes into DocuSign, but they also extended their implementation to include CLM. This is a prototype of the cross-sell opportunity, which has us so excited. And yet another customer, a consumer credit reporting agency previously had a small eSignature footprint from one of their sales teams. This quarter, they added a company-wide deployment of CLM, which in turn may lead to further eSignature opportunities throughout their business. This is a great example of how our land and expand motion can take multiple paths. Next, I'm pleased to report that we began to see some nice progress in the federal vertical. This quarter, we partnered with a prominent government agency for a very significant deal. They're currently deploying CLM as the foundational system for the department to better track document status, identify delays in their processes, and provide better transparency throughout the agency. Also this quarter, we signed a branch of the United States Armed Forces through an ISV partnership. First, they purchased eSignature to help streamline the recruiting process. Now, in an effort to further modernize the recruitment and retention system, they are expanding this use case with the addition of other Agreement Cloud offerings, which are closely integrated with their sales force CRM. This expanding adoption of eSignature and the increasing traction of other products in the Agreement Cloud, continues to drive our business. We believe DocuSign Agreement Cloud defines an entirely new category of cloud software. It complements the marketing, sales, HR, ERP and other cloud categories that already exist, connecting them all into the agreement process. To realize this big vision, we need to create and deliver a number of products that automate and connect the entire agreement process across multiple departments and industry verticals. Most notably this quarter, we added DocuSign Rooms for Mortgage, a solution that helps mortgage lenders accelerate closing times and improve the borrower experience. It provides a secure, digital workspace for everyone involved in a mortgage. It's actually flexible enough to support traditional closings, speed of pen and paper, as well as drive fully digital closing and hybrid closings as well. Rooms for Mortgage is a great example of DocuSign\u2019s focus on a particular vertical. In the mortgage industry, it costs thousands of dollars for a lender to process mortgage end-to-end. One of the reasons is that there are so many ingredients involved from the application to the title and the settlement. These processes today are manual and costly. That's why we think a mortgage-specific solution is such a great opportunity for us. We can automate and connect the many steps within the process, making it faster, less expensive, and a better customer experience for all parties. So, to wrap up, let me summarize. We are seeing strong performance across our core growth drivers of eSignature expansion and increasing adoption of other Agreement Cloud products. We are positioning the DocuSign Agreement Cloud as the next must have cloud that underpins both front office and back office functions. And we are seeing the market respond well with the public and private sectors embracing our vision and our technology. Together with our core eSignature offerings, we believe that this expands our TAM well beyond the original $25 billion projection. In closing, I wanted to mention one last item. I\u2019m pleased to share that we recently appointed Tr\u00e2m Phi, our new General Counsel to lead and oversee legal affairs and risk management. Tr\u00e2m brings more than 20 years of corporate legal and general counsel experience to her role, including leading two technology IPOs. We're very excited to have her on board. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Mike to walk through our financials in greater detail. Mike?\nMike Sheridan: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I would like to remind you that our non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of debt discount, and employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions. In addition, this quarter's results include contributions from SpringCM, whereas the comparable quarter a year ago excludes SpringCM, which was acquired in Q3 of fiscal \u201819. We saw substantial top line growth in the second quarter, driven by strong customer demand. Our total revenue rose 41% year-over-year to $236 million with subscription revenues growing 39% to $221 million. Our North American business was particularly strong this quarter. In addition, international revenues grew 47% year-over-year to $42 million. Second quarter billings increased 47% year-over-year to $252 million. On a four-quarter rolling average basis, billings grew -- growth was 36%. We saw strength in our core eSignature solutions as well as good progress in our sales of CLM products to new and existing customers. As Dan mentioned, this quarter, we also saw good progress in our sales into federal agencies. In Q2, we completed our first federal sale that exceeded $1 million in ACV, and this sale included significant components of both eSignature and CLM. We added a total of approximately 29,000 new customers this quarter, of which 4,000 were new direct customers. This was an increase of 31% in our commercial and enterprise install base. This brings our total customer base to 537,000 with 64,000 direct customers worldwide. In addition to strong new customer growth, we also saw strong growth in upsells into our install base. Our dollar net retention increased to 113%. And customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 50% year-over-year to a total of 370 customers worldwide. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 78% compared to 81% in the same quarter last year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 84% compared with 87% a year ago. These margin impacts relate primarily to the addition of SpringCM, as well as higher capacity needs of our outsource data centers in developing regions where we do not have our own proprietary data centers. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $185 million or 78% of total revenue, compared with $132 million or 79% of total revenue for the second quarter last year. These expenses include approximately $6 million related to the RPost litigation, which settled in the beginning of Q3. The significant majority of these RPost expenses are legal fees with a smaller amount related to the settlement. This settlement resolved all outstanding disputes with RPost. So, we do not expect any significant expenses related to these matters in Q3 or going forward. Non-GAAP operating loss was less than $1 million in Q2, which includes the $6 million of RPost expenses. This compares to a $4 million non-GAAP operating income or 3% operating margin in Q2 of fiscal \u201819. For the first half of fiscal \u201820, our non-GAAP operating profit was $9.7 million, which includes the impact of $9.2 million of RPost legal and settlement expenses. We ended the quarter with 3,489 employees, a year-over-year increase of 35%. We generated $26 million in operating cash flow compared with $23 million in Q2 of last year. Free cash flow came in at $12 million, compared to $18 million in the prior year. As we discussed previously, we saw particularly strong collections in Q1 of amounts that would typically be collected in Q2. For the first half of this year, we generated $72 million of operating cash flow, a 91% increase year-over-year, and we generated $42 million of free cash flow, a 56% increase year-over-year. In Q3 and the second half, we will continue to invest in the data center and real estate projects we have discussed previously, which will reduce second half cash flows below recent trends. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal 2020. We estimate first that revenue will range between $237 million to $241 million in Q3 and $947 million to $951 million for fiscal \u201820. And billings will range between $260 million to $270 million in Q3 and $1.063 billion to $1.083 billion for fiscal \u201820. We are maintaining our guidance for gross margin of 78% to 80% for Q3 and the fiscal year. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues in Q3 and fiscal \u201920; R&D in the range of 15% to 17% for Q3 in fiscal \u201820; and G&A in the range of 10% to 12% for Q3, and 11% to 13% for fiscal \u201820. For the third quarter, we expect $3 million to $4 million of interest in other non-operating income, including interest income and expense associated with our convertible debt. And for fiscal \u201820, we expect interest and non-operating income of $13 million to $16 million. We expect the tax provision of approximately $1 million to $2 million for the third quarter and $6 million to $8 million for fiscal \u201820. We expect fully diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 185 million to 190 million shares for Q3 and 190 million to 195 million shares for fiscal \u201820. We continue to be on track to spend $60 million to $70 million in capital investments in fiscal \u201820. We expect the majority of our second half spending to occur in Q3 as we ramp up the buildout of our Dublin office in the dedicated federal data center. In summary, we are very pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of fiscal \u201820 towards our strategic and financial goals. And we believe we are well-positioned to continue our strong execution in the second half of the fiscal year. With that, I'd like to now open it for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. So, last quarter, you talked about potential for elongating sales cycles as customers were evaluating CLM in the broader part of the product portfolio. Are we to take, given the strength in the results, the guidance and some of the examples that those deals have closed and perhaps you\u2019re kind of settling into what you think is the new norm around sales cycle timing?\nMike Sheridan: Hey, Sterling. Yes. I would tell you, it\u2019s similar to what we said last quarter that last quarter was the first quarter where we had CLM offerings available to our sales force to sell. So, we had some deals slip out in the quarter where we didn't have any deals slipping in since it was the first quarter. I think, if you look at Q2, as we expected, some of those Q1 deals moved into Q2 and there were some Q2 deal that moved to Q3, much like we expected. So, yes, I think that going forward, we would expect that to normalize. I would say also that while the more complicated multiproduct deals will continue to have longer sales cycles, I think we made a good progress in the sales teams moving down the learning curve as we get more experience.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. And then, one follow-up on the federal opportunity. In terms of the go-to-market, should we expect that most of the opportunities are going to go through either some sort of prime contractor or other partner or how much of the opportunity can you actually now take direct, based on where you are with certifications et cetera?\nDan Springer: Yes. I think, we are going to see a combination, Sterling. I think, the phenomenon is that there are certain sort of master contractors that have every large overall relationships, and they will look -- even if we're doing sort of a selling directly to the agency, we will get pulled into those larger master agreements which we're perfectly happy to do. And as we mentioned on the call of the sort of two big pieces we are excited about this quarter, one of them was more direct and one of them was through sort of a bundle from master contractor. I think there is going to be a mix. At this point, it will be early for us to try to give you a flavor of what that mix would look like, other than to say, I think we will see both flavors.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Two, maybe one for Mike, one for Dan. Maybe I\u2019ll ask both at the same time. So, Mike, $27 million billings outperformance is I think your biggest perhaps since the first quarter when you came public. So, I just want to press a little bit more on where that outperformance came from. And maybe you could answer it in the context of whether it was core eSignature really outperformed or the CLM stuff really took off, or perhaps -- and this is maybe what Sterling was getting at, was there an unusual catch-up in 2Q quarter where some of the deals that slipped out of Q1 all closed in 2Q, so this outperformance was unusual? So, that that was the question for Mike. And then, for Dan, last earnings call, you talked a little bit about this new sales structure, at least to North America where you split it between new logos and install base. And perhaps you can give an update on three months later whether that process is now fine tuned and whether you're looking to make any other sales structure changes? Thanks so much.\nMike Sheridan: Thanks, Karl. Yes. I'll take the billings question first. I guess at the highest level, I would reiterate what I talked about in prior quarters, which is billings as we all know, is a statistic that is affected by timing differences of timing of orders booked and everything else. And so, it's not a perfect growth statistic. And so, I always look at it as the fourth quarter rolling average, which was 36%, which, for example, last quarter of 27% year-over-year growth isn't terribly telling and a 47% might not be as telling this quarter either. I think, looking at those trailing averages makes sense for that particular statistic. With that said, we had an excellent quarter and the things that we\u2019re talking about strong North American performance, good growth in CLM, the fed coming online first, those all contributed to the good growth statistics we saw both in billings and revenue.\nDan Springer: On the sales structure, Karl, I think we felt really good, as I indicated before that the right answer was to have a split between what we call newco and install base, and we tested that at the end of last year with our SMB business and decided it was successful. And I think, the best telltale sign of why we're pleased with that result, the core goal there is to make sure we have enough people focused on generating newcos, which are traditionally a harder sales process than the upsell to the install base. And the fact that you saw the 4,000 new direct customers coming on board, that's a great indication to me but it was a very strong quarter and that our efforts in sort of bifurcating the sales force that way, is spot on. So, we're really pleased with that approach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: First, I just wanted to go back to billings. I don't mean to harp on it, but that's clearly going to be sort of the headline after what happened last quarter and then where we are at this quarter until we understand all the moving pieces. But, I just want to understand, A, if we kind of think about this on a rolling four-quarter basis, like you alluded to, is somewhere in that let\u2019s call it mid to upper 30s type of growth rate, is that the right way to think about what the underlying growth of the business is right now, versus looking at the 27% or 47% of isolation? And then, alongside that, it looks like there wasn\u2019t a duration impact right with average contract ranks both on dollar rate and by contracts, pretty consistent with where they've been the last several quarters. But I just wanted to confirm that none of the uptake in billings was caused by something on the duration side.\nMike Sheridan: Yes. So, let me answer the second part first on the duration that doesn't have an impact on billings, it's stable, number one. But also even multiyear contracts, we still build them manually. So, even if we did have a change in duration, it wouldn't affect the billings statistic. And in terms of how to look at billings as a growth indicator, yes, I think, you summarized it correctly, which is in any particular quarter, you can have that particular statistic affected by timing and other things. And so, we do look at it on a on a rolling basis. And in quarters where it\u2019s a bit lower, we don't want that over-interpreted; in a quarter like this, we don't want the 47% over-interpreted either. I think, in fairness, looking at that land, which takes away some of the noise of inter-quarter movement of deals that closed in one week versus another, those kinds of things, the rolling average, I think helps to give you a better indication of where the core growth is going.\nRishi Jaluria: And then, just a quick follow-up if I may, going to subscription, gross margin. I understand, again a lot of moving pieces here, if we kind of focus on the two of the data center side, and then SpringCM, maybe just help us understand going forward A, can we expect to see some optimization of the SpringCM or I guess DocuSign CLM gross margins to come back in line with where the core eSignature offering is? And then, B, on the data center side, is that something that again, at least weight on overall subscription gross margins can maybe start to go away over time? That\u2019s it. Thanks.\nMike Sheridan: Yes. So, I think, if you look at our guidance, the 78% is on the low end of the range. So, I think that would tell you that I do believe there is opportunities for us to continue to optimize and leverage our investments. The SpringCM model did have a lower margin profile. I think, as we continue to expand our successful CLM, we will get a better leverage out of some of that infrastructure. And yes, the datacenter usage variance that we had some this quarter, while it costs us a bit more money, it\u2019s an indication that we needed that capacity for more usage in our install base. So, it might have a little bit of an unfavorable impact on costs but it's a pretty positive indicator in terms of what our customers are doing with the product.\nDan Springer: And I\u2019d just add, I think for the growth -- when we see that progress, as Mike described, it's a good leading indicator that we're seeing that growth trend going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my questions, and really nice job in the quarter. From my end, looking at the dynamic that we saw in Q1 where you had extended selling cycles into existing, it\u2019s not something that software investors typically see. Usually, we see extensions of sales cycles to new customers. What are the adjustments that you've been making behind the scenes to get that under control on your sales -- or within your sales organization and get those cycles back in line? And how are those -- how are you thinking about these kind of extensions as we get into the really big second half of the year, especially Q4? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nDan Springer: Sure. So, Stan, I think, two things. One is, as Mike indicated earlier in the commentary, there is definitely a phenomenon that not all products have that same cycle time. And we do see that -- and do expect that CLM will have a longer cycle time of sales. And one of the major drivers behind that is, there is more of an implementation plan, so you actually have to have a bigger statement of work. And again, we love it. We can choose one of our system integrator partners. Sometimes we do that work ourselves. But regardless, there ends up to be a more effort, and I think elongated process than we would have in a traditional eSignature. So, as Mike said, if you think about that mix over time, you will expect some elongation because of that. Again, we don't think that's a bad thing. We think it\u2019s an opportunity to have larger footprint at our customers. But the second piece to get to the opportunities that we can improve our performance aspect is really around sales enablement. And I think that phenomenon for us is when it was a very early, first couple of quarters of new product at least didn't have the scale of enablement we needed to have. If we look into the second half, I think you're spot on that that's the big opportunity for us because we have so much of our business that occurs in the second half. And we feel we really are accelerating those investments to enable our team to not just be successful with the traditional eSignature offering, but also with the broader system of agreement offerings we're delivering through the DocuSign Agreement Cloud.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it, perfect. And then, a follow-up. As you sell these larger Agreement Cloud contracts into customers, just may be anecdotally, how much bigger are these contracts that you sell into these customers, or at least what you\u2019ve seen thus far as the proof points? And Mike, maybe for you, what is that due to net revenue retention as we move through the rest of this year and perhaps into next year? That's it for me. Thank you.\nDan Springer: So, Stan, on first piece, I think, the number of observations we have is still limited. So, I don't know that we can yet get you a sense of here\u2019s how we think they\u2019ll play out. I can tell you this from the observations we had. With some customer situation where the CLM opportunity, just one of the other components of the Agreement Cloud that we\u2019re most focused on, can be significantly larger than what they would do from an eSignature standpoint. But, we also have lots of customers that are going to be eSignature customers to CLM, as an example, might not be appropriate for their business where we think virtually every company on the planet will eventually be using eSignature. So, if you think about it that way, there\u2019s going to be a lot of difference in them. And in general, I would say CLM opportunities can be bigger, but it's too early to tell right now sort of what that average would look like.\nMike Sheridan: And in terms of the dollar net retention, obviously having more products available to the sales force, to bring to the install base is a good thing, when it comes to both mitigating churn but also expanding a footprint that we have inside the customer. So, the range that we've seen historically is of 112% to 119%. I think, it's still a valid range, but I think that can certainly be helpful in moving us up into that range as we continue to get success in the install base.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Ives: Thanks, and great quarter. So, can you talk about international in terms of what you're seeing there, just changes, obviously seems like ramping growth? May be you can just talk about the international trajectory and maybe what you saw this quarter?\nDan Springer: Sure. Overall, Dan, as you head us talk about, we believe that we have an opportunity for our international growth overall to outpace our U.S. growth, although we had very strong quarter in the U.S. and those guys are doing their darndest to make it harder for the international team to \"take share\", if you will, of our overall business. I think traditionally, we talk about this a lot, it\u2019s a consistent message, which is the folks that were in the common law countries, were the places that we got most of our initial traction that places like the UK and Canada and Australia. And I think, we continue to see good strength there. In particular, we've now started to see some acceleration in some of the civil law countries. We see that in sort of France, Germany, we see that in Brazil, and we will see that I think, over time in Japan more as well. So, we had some pockets that were quite encouraging for us that we're going to continue to achieve what we said from an international growth standpoint. And again, I think it's broadly across the board that we see those opportunities across both common and civil.\nDan Ives: And in terms of the product strategy, could you maybe talk about your view of organically building on to the footprint versus maybe some acquisitions in terms of what you could see in the margin? Just talk around the EBITDA puts and takes there and how you are thinking about it?\nDan Springer: Absolutely. And so, if you think about what\u2019s laid out with the overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud opportunity, we've been very clear that we want to provide for our customers the best possible solutions. And we have a very strong commitment having an open platform. And I don't think you are going to see anyone who's more motivated than we are to continue to build out both our API capabilities as well as the prebuild integrations, and we have just over 350 of them now. So, again, strong commitment to keep it open. At the same time, part of the reason we got to the construct of the Agreement Cloud is that our customers were telling us, we want to have more integrated strongly with core eSignature capability. And that's why we started, if you remember the history, looking for folks who are interested in the prepare product, because they said it\u2019d be great if that could be integrated with the DocGen [ph] capability, right at the DocuSign. Going forward, we make the choice versus sort of the build and the buy and the partner. I think, the answer is all of the above. I think we're going to continue to look for opportunities, as we did with Spring where we saw there was a significant amount of customer demand. And we felt that there was a skill set -- sort of a capability that we didn't have that domain expertise is strong within DocuSign, so we could build it ourselves and we just think it\u2019d make sense to get there faster to acquisition. And that's how we look at things today. We see the ability that's very close to what we already have, those intrinsic capabilities, we\u2019ll probably continue to build and innovate internally. And when we see someone who's just far ahead of us with that expertise and that domain knowledge, then, we'll look for the acquisitions. That's really I think is going to be the pivot on how we buy versus partner versus build our self.\nOperator: The next question comes from line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nShankar Subramanian: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have two questions. One, can you add some more color on the strength of your pipeline in the government and ECLM business? Do you expect them to kind of accelerate through the year or do you see any kind of lumpiness in those businesses? And maybe you can even add some color on the eSignature pipeline?\nDan Springer: Sure. So, to your perspective on the pipe and specifically around government. Look, we've been very clear from the beginning that we are hugely excited about what we think is quite frankly a massive opportunity for us in public sector. And at the same time, I think we've also tried to be very cautious about understanding that the cycle to sort of realize that opportunity is not going to be the same as we've had in our traditional commercial business. And so, I think, the best way for us to look at it right now as we look at Q2, we're very pleased with these significant deals that we talked about on the call. And we believe there will be more deals like that. I don't think I would characterize it as if there is sort of like a floodgate opened up and once we have our first large deal, all of the rest of the government agencies are going to come running. And at the same time, I think it's a very strong proof point that the government agencies will eventually come to DocuSign. So that goes back to as we start to think about the TAM, a significant portion of what we always thought was the big opportunity, not only for eSignature but for the broader Agreement Cloud offering was on the federal and continued state and local success as we've had in the past. That's how we sort of think about it. It's a really big proof point of the size of the opportunity, but we're not yet making a call. So, it's going to lead to some acceleration in our business in the near term.\nShankar Subramanian: Now, one of the things that I took away from the conversations in your conference in June was that the CLM business, while it adds a lot of value to customers, it was kind of hard to find the budget for CLM; it was a new kind of a venture for a lot of the customers. Can you maybe address how you are addressing that -- the dollar, the budget question among customers? And maybe some color around the recent deals which are closed, kind of how the sales cycle started and how do they get the customer to kind of move from, I don't know what it is to like actually signing a deal?\nDan Springer: Absolutely. Well, I think, in CLM, it's actually not too different than it was several years ago with eSignature. As the pioneer in that space, there was no one that had an eSignature specific budget. But, if you were a human resources team, you were spending money on, as an example, sending out offer letters and having people manage that manual process. And we came along and said, here's what the budget opportunity is, let's replace that labor intensive and manual process that has postage and other physical costs, FedEx costs in it with our solution. So, we really transferred budget that came from sort of the offline to the online. And we see the exact same phenomenon in when we're talking to people at CLM. It's true that a lot of people didn't have a historic budget for CLM, if they're coming in entering the space now, but they had a way that they managed all those contracts. And a lot of it is manual processes, and that's the opportunity we come in and show a fantastic ROI by telling them that the money and time that people are spending today on those processes could be dramatically more efficient and provide a better customer experience. So, we really substitute their old spend with the new spend. I think, we're seeing the exact same phenomenon as I said in CLM, as we saw developed with eSignature.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you and congratulations. So, Dan, I think one thing that makes investors nervous about DocuSign is when they spend too much time talking to the IR people of your competitors. And so, I think it would be helpful if you talk a little bit about how your approach to the market is different than Adobe or Dropbox?\nDan Springer: Yes. I think, Pat, my sense is, as you know, when we talk about the competitive dynamics, on the one hand, we are laser-focused on what we see other people doing in the marketplace. And you're talking mostly by eSignature competitive set there, but it's exact same thing when we look at the overall Agreement Cloud. We look very closely what other people are doing. And at the same time, even though we have that maniacal focus on potential competitive threat, we have been fortunate to have a very strong leadership position in the marketplace. Not only did we build the core eSignature market, but we have maintained a dramatic market share lead. And so, we really believe that our biggest focus is less about being overly concerned about specific actions or tactics that other people are doing and rather focus on going after this giant TAM that's ahead of us where we have so much of a high ROI opportunity to provide to our customers. So, again, when we talk about what product, we're going to build, we actually talk to our customers and say what's the functionality and capability you need to have a broader relationship with DocuSign, which is why we got into the Agreement Cloud vision that we've talked about in the past. So, yes, we just don't see that having a significant part of our business -- impact on our business from those competitive threats. So, I don't know exactly what the IR departments in those other companies say. But from our standpoint, we are laser-focused on the customer side and really not putting too much focus on what the other folks are saying.\nPat Walravens: All right. Great. And then, a quick one. Is the federal data center done?\nMike Sheridan: No, it's not done yet. But, we're going to complete it this fiscal year. There is more work to be done in Q3.\nPat Walravens: Okay, great. Thank you.\nDan Springer: And, Pat, just a clarification to make sure broad [ph] takeaway, as Mike said, we're building that separate data center for federal, but we are serving government including federal customers today. Not all government business requires a dedicated government infrastructure. So, we are in fact serving them today, but it unlocks additional use cases and opportunities for people that have higher security requirements.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Matthew Wells with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Wells: Thanks for taking my question. When I size 1.5 billings growth, there is an acceleration year-over-year, while net expansion rates in the first half have actually trended down. I'm curious if you could just unpack what's driving this? Are you seeing larger initial deals in the commercial and enterprise space?\nMike Sheridan: I think, one piece of it is going to be that in the first half of this year we had SpringCM and we had CLM as part of our business, in the first half of last year, we did not. And so Q3, this coming quarter will be the first quarter where CLM will be in both quarters. So, I think, that's one factor. I think, on the dollar net retention, it has fluctuated a little bit but it\u2019s remained relatively in the same place. So, I think, some of what you're seeing this year as we've been talking about it, starting to see greater contribution, just not in the former Spring business but actually seeing CLM getting sold by our sales force into our accounts is helping -- seeing the expansion internationally is helping things like starting to have success. In fact, all those things are contributing to that year-over-year improvement.\nMatthew Wells: And are you able to size the revenue and billings contribution from SpringCM in the quarter?\nMike Sheridan: No, we don't break it out separately. But, with and without, it was a very strong growth quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nDan Springer: Well, I want to thank you all for joining us. We're pleased with the progress in the quarter. And we look forward to seeing you all on the road in the weeks ahead. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "name": "Mike Sheridan",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I would like to remind you that our non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of debt discount, and employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions. In addition, this quarter's results include contributions from SpringCM, whereas the comparable quarter a year ago excludes SpringCM, which was acquired in Q3 of fiscal \u201819. We saw substantial top line growth in the second quarter, driven by strong customer demand. Our total revenue rose 41% year-over-year to $236 million with subscription revenues growing 39% to $221 million. Our North American business was particularly strong this quarter. In addition, international revenues grew 47% year-over-year to $42 million. Second quarter billings increased 47% year-over-year to $252 million. On a four-quarter rolling average basis, billings grew -- growth was 36%. We saw strength in our core eSignature solutions as well as good progress in our sales of CLM products to new and existing customers. As Dan mentioned, this quarter, we also saw good progress in our sales into federal agencies. In Q2, we completed our first federal sale that exceeded $1 million in ACV, and this sale included significant components of both eSignature and CLM. We added a total of approximately 29,000 new customers this quarter, of which 4,000 were new direct customers. This was an increase of 31% in our commercial and enterprise install base. This brings our total customer base to 537,000 with 64,000 direct customers worldwide. In addition to strong new customer growth, we also saw strong growth in upsells into our install base. Our dollar net retention increased to 113%. And customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 50% year-over-year to a total of 370 customers worldwide. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 78% compared to 81% in the same quarter last year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 84% compared with 87% a year ago. These margin impacts relate primarily to the addition of SpringCM, as well as higher capacity needs of our outsource data centers in developing regions where we do not have our own proprietary data centers. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $185 million or 78% of total revenue, compared with $132 million or 79% of total revenue for the second quarter last year. These expenses include approximately $6 million related to the RPost litigation, which settled in the beginning of Q3. The significant majority of these RPost expenses are legal fees with a smaller amount related to the settlement. This settlement resolved all outstanding disputes with RPost. So, we do not expect any significant expenses related to these matters in Q3 or going forward. Non-GAAP operating loss was less than $1 million in Q2, which includes the $6 million of RPost expenses. This compares to a $4 million non-GAAP operating income or 3% operating margin in Q2 of fiscal \u201819. For the first half of fiscal \u201820, our non-GAAP operating profit was $9.7 million, which includes the impact of $9.2 million of RPost legal and settlement expenses. We ended the quarter with 3,489 employees, a year-over-year increase of 35%. We generated $26 million in operating cash flow compared with $23 million in Q2 of last year. Free cash flow came in at $12 million, compared to $18 million in the prior year. As we discussed previously, we saw particularly strong collections in Q1 of amounts that would typically be collected in Q2. For the first half of this year, we generated $72 million of operating cash flow, a 91% increase year-over-year, and we generated $42 million of free cash flow, a 56% increase year-over-year. In Q3 and the second half, we will continue to invest in the data center and real estate projects we have discussed previously, which will reduce second half cash flows below recent trends. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal 2020. We estimate first that revenue will range between $237 million to $241 million in Q3 and $947 million to $951 million for fiscal \u201820. And billings will range between $260 million to $270 million in Q3 and $1.063 billion to $1.083 billion for fiscal \u201820. We are maintaining our guidance for gross margin of 78% to 80% for Q3 and the fiscal year. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues in Q3 and fiscal '20; R&D in the range of 15% to 17% for Q3 in fiscal \u201820; and G&A in the range of 10% to 12% for Q3, and 11% to 13% for fiscal \u201820. For the third quarter, we expect $3 million to $4 million of interest in other non-operating income, including interest income and expense associated with our convertible debt. And for fiscal \u201820, we expect interest and non-operating income of $13 million to $16 million. We expect the tax provision of approximately $1 million to $2 million for the third quarter and $6 million to $8 million for fiscal \u201820. We expect fully diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 185 million to 190 million shares for Q3 and 190 million to 195 million shares for fiscal \u201820. We continue to be on track to spend $60 million to $70 million in capital investments in fiscal \u201820. We expect the majority of our second half spending to occur in Q3 as we ramp up the buildout of our Dublin office in the dedicated federal data center. In summary, we are very pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of fiscal \u201820 towards our strategic and financial goals. And we believe we are well-positioned to continue our strong execution in the second half of the fiscal year. With that, I'd like to now open it for Q&A. Hey, Sterling. Yes. I would tell you, it's similar to what we said last quarter that last quarter was the first quarter where we had CLM offerings available to our sales force to sell. So, we had some deals slip out in the quarter where we didn't have any deals slipping in since it was the first quarter. I think, if you look at Q2, as we expected, some of those Q1 deals moved into Q2 and there were some Q2 deal that moved to Q3, much like we expected. So, yes, I think that going forward, we would expect that to normalize. I would say also that while the more complicated multiproduct deals will continue to have longer sales cycles, I think we made a good progress in the sales teams moving down the learning curve as we get more experience. Thanks, Karl. Yes. I'll take the billings question first. I guess at the highest level, I would reiterate what I talked about in prior quarters, which is billings as we all know, is a statistic that is affected by timing differences of timing of orders booked and everything else. And so, it's not a perfect growth statistic. And so, I always look at it as the fourth quarter rolling average, which was 36%, which, for example, last quarter of 27% year-over-year growth isn't terribly telling and a 47% might not be as telling this quarter either. I think, looking at those trailing averages makes sense for that particular statistic. With that said, we had an excellent quarter and the things that we're talking about strong North American performance, good growth in CLM, the fed coming online first, those all contributed to the good growth statistics we saw both in billings and revenue. Yes. So, let me answer the second part first on the duration that doesn't have an impact on billings, it's stable, number one. But also even multiyear contracts, we still build them manually. So, even if we did have a change in duration, it wouldn't affect the billings statistic. And in terms of how to look at billings as a growth indicator, yes, I think, you summarized it correctly, which is in any particular quarter, you can have that particular statistic affected by timing and other things. And so, we do look at it on a on a rolling basis. And in quarters where it's a bit lower, we don't want that over-interpreted; in a quarter like this, we don't want the 47% over-interpreted either. I think, in fairness, looking at that land, which takes away some of the noise of inter-quarter movement of deals that closed in one week versus another, those kinds of things, the rolling average, I think helps to give you a better indication of where the core growth is going. Yes. So, I think, if you look at our guidance, the 78% is on the low end of the range. So, I think that would tell you that I do believe there is opportunities for us to continue to optimize and leverage our investments. The SpringCM model did have a lower margin profile. I think, as we continue to expand our successful CLM, we will get a better leverage out of some of that infrastructure. And yes, the datacenter usage variance that we had some this quarter, while it costs us a bit more money, it's an indication that we needed that capacity for more usage in our install base. So, it might have a little bit of an unfavorable impact on costs but it's a pretty positive indicator in terms of what our customers are doing with the product. And in terms of the dollar net retention, obviously having more products available to the sales force, to bring to the install base is a good thing, when it comes to both mitigating churn but also expanding a footprint that we have inside the customer. So, the range that we've seen historically is of 112% to 119%. I think, it's still a valid range, but I think that can certainly be helpful in moving us up into that range as we continue to get success in the install base. No, it's not done yet. But, we're going to complete it this fiscal year. There is more work to be done in Q3. I think, one piece of it is going to be that in the first half of this year we had SpringCM and we had CLM as part of our business, in the first half of last year, we did not. And so Q3, this coming quarter will be the first quarter where CLM will be in both quarters. So, I think, that's one factor. I think, on the dollar net retention, it has fluctuated a little bit but it's remained relatively in the same place. So, I think, some of what you're seeing this year as we've been talking about it, starting to see greater contribution, just not in the former Spring business but actually seeing CLM getting sold by our sales force into our accounts is helping -- seeing the expansion internationally is helping things like starting to have success. In fact, all those things are contributing to that year-over-year improvement. No, we don't break it out separately. But, with and without, it was a very strong growth quarter."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings call. Today, I'm going to cover three sections: Our high level financial results and how we are driving strong growth; an update our Agreement Cloud vision, and how our strength in eSignature is the perfect on-ramp to expanded relationship with our customers; and finally, how we are rapidly delivering innovative solution to support the Agreement Cloud vision. I'll then pass it over to Mike for a more detailed rundown of our financials. Together, we believe it will showcase the strength in our existing business and the incredible potential for the future. So, let me start with our results and our commitment to growth. As part of our overall strategy, DocuSign has three main growth drivers, which you've heard me talk about before. One, acquire new customers; two, expand usage and use cases within existing customers; and finally, three, introduce innovative solutions to help customers modernize new parts of their Systems of Agreement. In this quarter, we saw progress on all three fronts. We acquired 29,000 new customers, approximately 4,000 of which are direct, bringing our total number of paying customers to 537,000 worldwide; 64,000 of those are direct. With strong consumer demand for our products within the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, we grew our revenues 41% year-over-year to $236 million and billings 47% year-over-year to $252 million. Expansion of eSignature volume and use cases was evident in our net dollar retention rate of 113%. These results reflect solid progress for our second quarter and they support our confidence in and our excitement for future. Next, I'd like to update you on our Agreement Cloud vision and our success with new product development there. Earlier this year, we introduced DocuSign Agreement Cloud. It is the umbrella for our suite of more than a dozen products and over 350 prebuilt integrations, all to help organizations connect and automate the entire agreement process from preparing, to signing, acting on and managing their agreements. This quarter, we saw particularly strong progress from the CLM product that came via our acquisition of SpringCM. CLM stands for contract lifecycle management, a term we will increasingly use as we transition the SpringCM product name to DocuSign CLM. Of course, we're still doing plenty of deals for our core eSignature solution by itself. And we believe this $25 billion market opportunity is still largely untapped. Moreover, we view nearly every eSignature win as the basis for future expansion to other Agreement Cloud products. We've begun to see multiple examples of how customers are connecting and automating various stages of the agreement process, while continuing to expand their eSignature use cases. One of the world's largest energy companies is currently using eSignature and CLM together for generating, negotiating and signing sales agreements. With their deployment of the Agreement Cloud integrated with their instances of Salesforce, Microsoft SharePoint, and SAP, they now can complete agreements that used to take days or weeks in as little as two minutes. The efficiency improvements they've seen with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud are saving the company tens of millions of dollars, and have the potential to save even more. Another customer, a cloud payroll services company, not only expanded on their core signature usage as they brought more internal processes into DocuSign, but they also extended their implementation to include CLM. This is a prototype of the cross-sell opportunity, which has us so excited. And yet another customer, a consumer credit reporting agency previously had a small eSignature footprint from one of their sales teams. This quarter, they added a company-wide deployment of CLM, which in turn may lead to further eSignature opportunities throughout their business. This is a great example of how our land and expand motion can take multiple paths. Next, I'm pleased to report that we began to see some nice progress in the federal vertical. This quarter, we partnered with a prominent government agency for a very significant deal. They're currently deploying CLM as the foundational system for the department to better track document status, identify delays in their processes, and provide better transparency throughout the agency. Also this quarter, we signed a branch of the United States Armed Forces through an ISV partnership. First, they purchased eSignature to help streamline the recruiting process. Now, in an effort to further modernize the recruitment and retention system, they are expanding this use case with the addition of other Agreement Cloud offerings, which are closely integrated with their sales force CRM. This expanding adoption of eSignature and the increasing traction of other products in the Agreement Cloud, continues to drive our business. We believe DocuSign Agreement Cloud defines an entirely new category of cloud software. It complements the marketing, sales, HR, ERP and other cloud categories that already exist, connecting them all into the agreement process. To realize this big vision, we need to create and deliver a number of products that automate and connect the entire agreement process across multiple departments and industry verticals. Most notably this quarter, we added DocuSign Rooms for Mortgage, a solution that helps mortgage lenders accelerate closing times and improve the borrower experience. It provides a secure, digital workspace for everyone involved in a mortgage. It's actually flexible enough to support traditional closings, speed of pen and paper, as well as drive fully digital closing and hybrid closings as well. Rooms for Mortgage is a great example of DocuSign's focus on a particular vertical. In the mortgage industry, it costs thousands of dollars for a lender to process mortgage end-to-end. One of the reasons is that there are so many ingredients involved from the application to the title and the settlement. These processes today are manual and costly. That's why we think a mortgage-specific solution is such a great opportunity for us. We can automate and connect the many steps within the process, making it faster, less expensive, and a better customer experience for all parties. So, to wrap up, let me summarize. We are seeing strong performance across our core growth drivers of eSignature expansion and increasing adoption of other Agreement Cloud products. We are positioning the DocuSign Agreement Cloud as the next must have cloud that underpins both front office and back office functions. And we are seeing the market respond well with the public and private sectors embracing our vision and our technology. Together with our core eSignature offerings, we believe that this expands our TAM well beyond the original $25 billion projection. In closing, I wanted to mention one last item. I'm pleased to share that we recently appointed Tra\u0302m Phi, our new General Counsel to lead and oversee legal affairs and risk management. Tra\u0302m brings more than 20 years of corporate legal and general counsel experience to her role, including leading two technology IPOs. We're very excited to have her on board. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Mike to walk through our financials in greater detail. Mike? Yes. I think, we are going to see a combination, Sterling. I think, the phenomenon is that there are certain sort of master contractors that have every large overall relationships, and they will look -- even if we're doing sort of a selling directly to the agency, we will get pulled into those larger master agreements which we're perfectly happy to do. And as we mentioned on the call of the sort of two big pieces we are excited about this quarter, one of them was more direct and one of them was through sort of a bundle from master contractor. I think there is going to be a mix. At this point, it will be early for us to try to give you a flavor of what that mix would look like, other than to say, I think we will see both flavors. On the sales structure, Karl, I think we felt really good, as I indicated before that the right answer was to have a split between what we call newco and install base, and we tested that at the end of last year with our SMB business and decided it was successful. And I think, the best telltale sign of why we're pleased with that result, the core goal there is to make sure we have enough people focused on generating newcos, which are traditionally a harder sales process than the upsell to the install base. And the fact that you saw the 4,000 new direct customers coming on board, that's a great indication to me but it was a very strong quarter and that our efforts in sort of bifurcating the sales force that way, is spot on. So, we're really pleased with that approach. And I'd just add, I think for the growth -- when we see that progress, as Mike described, it's a good leading indicator that we're seeing that growth trend going forward. Sure. So, Stan, I think, two things. One is, as Mike indicated earlier in the commentary, there is definitely a phenomenon that not all products have that same cycle time. And we do see that -- and do expect that CLM will have a longer cycle time of sales. And one of the major drivers behind that is, there is more of an implementation plan, so you actually have to have a bigger statement of work. And again, we love it. We can choose one of our system integrator partners. Sometimes we do that work ourselves. But regardless, there ends up to be a more effort, and I think elongated process than we would have in a traditional eSignature. So, as Mike said, if you think about that mix over time, you will expect some elongation because of that. Again, we don't think that's a bad thing. We think it's an opportunity to have larger footprint at our customers. But the second piece to get to the opportunities that we can improve our performance aspect is really around sales enablement. And I think that phenomenon for us is when it was a very early, first couple of quarters of new product at least didn't have the scale of enablement we needed to have. If we look into the second half, I think you're spot on that that's the big opportunity for us because we have so much of our business that occurs in the second half. And we feel we really are accelerating those investments to enable our team to not just be successful with the traditional eSignature offering, but also with the broader system of agreement offerings we're delivering through the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. So, Stan, on first piece, I think, the number of observations we have is still limited. So, I don't know that we can yet get you a sense of here's how we think they'll play out. I can tell you this from the observations we had. With some customer situation where the CLM opportunity, just one of the other components of the Agreement Cloud that we're most focused on, can be significantly larger than what they would do from an eSignature standpoint. But, we also have lots of customers that are going to be eSignature customers to CLM, as an example, might not be appropriate for their business where we think virtually every company on the planet will eventually be using eSignature. So, if you think about it that way, there's going to be a lot of difference in them. And in general, I would say CLM opportunities can be bigger, but it's too early to tell right now sort of what that average would look like. Sure. Overall, Dan, as you head us talk about, we believe that we have an opportunity for our international growth overall to outpace our U.S. growth, although we had very strong quarter in the U.S. and those guys are doing their darndest to make it harder for the international team to \"take share\", if you will, of our overall business. I think traditionally, we talk about this a lot, it's a consistent message, which is the folks that were in the common law countries, were the places that we got most of our initial traction that places like the UK and Canada and Australia. And I think, we continue to see good strength there. In particular, we've now started to see some acceleration in some of the civil law countries. We see that in sort of France, Germany, we see that in Brazil, and we will see that I think, over time in Japan more as well. So, we had some pockets that were quite encouraging for us that we're going to continue to achieve what we said from an international growth standpoint. And again, I think it's broadly across the board that we see those opportunities across both common and civil. Absolutely. And so, if you think about what's laid out with the overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud opportunity, we've been very clear that we want to provide for our customers the best possible solutions. And we have a very strong commitment having an open platform. And I don't think you are going to see anyone who's more motivated than we are to continue to build out both our API capabilities as well as the prebuild integrations, and we have just over 350 of them now. So, again, strong commitment to keep it open. At the same time, part of the reason we got to the construct of the Agreement Cloud is that our customers were telling us, we want to have more integrated strongly with core eSignature capability. And that's why we started, if you remember the history, looking for folks who are interested in the prepare product, because they said it'd be great if that could be integrated with the DocGen [ph] capability, right at the DocuSign. Going forward, we make the choice versus sort of the build and the buy and the partner. I think, the answer is all of the above. I think we're going to continue to look for opportunities, as we did with Spring where we saw there was a significant amount of customer demand. And we felt that there was a skill set -- sort of a capability that we didn't have that domain expertise is strong within DocuSign, so we could build it ourselves and we just think it'd make sense to get there faster to acquisition. And that's how we look at things today. We see the ability that's very close to what we already have, those intrinsic capabilities, we'll probably continue to build and innovate internally. And when we see someone who's just far ahead of us with that expertise and that domain knowledge, then, we'll look for the acquisitions. That's really I think is going to be the pivot on how we buy versus partner versus build our self. Sure. So, to your perspective on the pipe and specifically around government. Look, we've been very clear from the beginning that we are hugely excited about what we think is quite frankly a massive opportunity for us in public sector. And at the same time, I think we've also tried to be very cautious about understanding that the cycle to sort of realize that opportunity is not going to be the same as we've had in our traditional commercial business. And so, I think, the best way for us to look at it right now as we look at Q2, we're very pleased with these significant deals that we talked about on the call. And we believe there will be more deals like that. I don't think I would characterize it as if there is sort of like a floodgate opened up and once we have our first large deal, all of the rest of the government agencies are going to come running. And at the same time, I think it's a very strong proof point that the government agencies will eventually come to DocuSign. So that goes back to as we start to think about the TAM, a significant portion of what we always thought was the big opportunity, not only for eSignature but for the broader Agreement Cloud offering was on the federal and continued state and local success as we've had in the past. That's how we sort of think about it. It's a really big proof point of the size of the opportunity, but we're not yet making a call. So, it's going to lead to some acceleration in our business in the near term. Absolutely. Well, I think, in CLM, it's actually not too different than it was several years ago with eSignature. As the pioneer in that space, there was no one that had an eSignature specific budget. But, if you were a human resources team, you were spending money on, as an example, sending out offer letters and having people manage that manual process. And we came along and said, here's what the budget opportunity is, let's replace that labor intensive and manual process that has postage and other physical costs, FedEx costs in it with our solution. So, we really transferred budget that came from sort of the offline to the online. And we see the exact same phenomenon in when we're talking to people at CLM. It's true that a lot of people didn't have a historic budget for CLM, if they're coming in entering the space now, but they had a way that they managed all those contracts. And a lot of it is manual processes, and that's the opportunity we come in and show a fantastic ROI by telling them that the money and time that people are spending today on those processes could be dramatically more efficient and provide a better customer experience. So, we really substitute their old spend with the new spend. I think, we're seeing the exact same phenomenon as I said in CLM, as we saw developed with eSignature. Yes. I think, Pat, my sense is, as you know, when we talk about the competitive dynamics, on the one hand, we are laser-focused on what we see other people doing in the marketplace. And you're talking mostly by eSignature competitive set there, but it's exact same thing when we look at the overall Agreement Cloud. We look very closely what other people are doing. And at the same time, even though we have that maniacal focus on potential competitive threat, we have been fortunate to have a very strong leadership position in the marketplace. Not only did we build the core eSignature market, but we have maintained a dramatic market share lead. And so, we really believe that our biggest focus is less about being overly concerned about specific actions or tactics that other people are doing and rather focus on going after this giant TAM that's ahead of us where we have so much of a high ROI opportunity to provide to our customers. So, again, when we talk about what product, we're going to build, we actually talk to our customers and say what's the functionality and capability you need to have a broader relationship with DocuSign, which is why we got into the Agreement Cloud vision that we've talked about in the past. So, yes, we just don't see that having a significant part of our business -- impact on our business from those competitive threats. So, I don't know exactly what the IR departments in those other companies say. But from our standpoint, we are laser-focused on the customer side and really not putting too much focus on what the other folks are saying. And, Pat, just a clarification to make sure broad [ph] takeaway, as Mike said, we're building that separate data center for federal, but we are serving government including federal customers today. Not all government business requires a dedicated government infrastructure. So, we are in fact serving them today, but it unlocks additional use cases and opportunities for people that have higher security requirements. Well, I want to thank you all for joining us. We're pleased with the progress in the quarter. And we look forward to seeing you all on the road in the weeks ahead. Thanks for joining."

I'd like to start by highlighting some of the quarter's results and then go into announcements we made this quarter around our DocuSign Agreement Cloud suite of products. Let me start with financial results and a couple of key highlights. DocuSign began the year with solid top and bottom line results, marking our 6th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP earnings per share. First quarter revenue was $214 million, representing 37% growth year-over-year. We were again profitable on a non-GAAP basis with operating income of nearly $10 million or 5% for the quarter. We also had an exceptionally strong quarter in terms of cash flow, with $30 million of free cash flow. Two highlights stand out for me this quarter. The first is the announcement of the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. Our expanding product portfolio that addresses not just signing, but the entire agreement process both before and after that signature. I will talk more about this shortly, but this broader scope and deeper offering could significantly increase our TAM from the $25 billion eSignature TAM. Second highlight is the further rollout of specialized sales team focused on new customer acquisition while others will focus on the installed base. This is something we tested with great success last year and rolled out more broadly in North America this year. We are already seeing a net increase in new logos as well as the expansion of use cases within our existing customers. Overall, we are confident and excited about the year ahead, and the longer-term vision and opportunity for DocuSign. So, today, I'd like to share some more detail on two areas \u2013 the demand we are seeing for DocuSign eSignature and the strategic opportunity that the DocuSign Agreement Cloud represents. Let's first talk about the demand. We continue to see strong growth and leadership in our core eSignature solution across all segments and geographies. Let me share some numbers with you to give context. Our customer count continues to increase, and as of the end of Q1, we have almost 508,000 paying customers around the world. That's up from 405,000 in Q1 of fiscal year 2019. We continue to see growth in our international markets. In markets like the UK, France, Germany, Brazil, Australia, and Japan, we are just beginning to tap the potential. And no matter where our customers are based, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand the use of eSignature into other department. As has long been the case, once companies experience speed, time, and simplicity benefit of DocuSign eSignature, they are keen to replicate those results elsewhere in the enterprise. A great example of this is one of our global consumer packaged goods customer started with just a single eSignature use case in their human resources department, and just a few years later, they now have 100 use cases deployed or in development across multiple business units. We expect this pattern of use case expansion to continue driving revenue growth for the company for years to come. Now, let's talk about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, and our ability to automate and connect the entire agreement process. In March this year, we just announced the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, our expanding suite of more than a dozen products and over 350 integrations for digitally transforming how organizations prepare, sign, act on, and manage their agreements. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud includes our flagship eSignature product and several other DocuSign product offerings, as well as the recently acquired SpringCM offering for contract life cycle management, and the hundreds of integrations to other applications involved in the agreement process, such as those from Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and SAP. It also includes three new products that were announced after our last earnings call. So, I'd like to take a moment to highlight them today. The first is DocuSign Gen, designed for small to medium businesses, primarily in the salesforce ecosystem. Gen enables sales reps and other users to automatically generate signature-ready contracts with just a few clicks, and do it directly from within salesforce. This can result in faster deals, fewer errors, and greater productivity. The second new product is DocuSign Click. It allows organizations of any size to capture consent to standard agreement terms on websites such as a privacy policy with just a single click. These so-called, no-signature-required agreements are a new opportunity for DocuSign to replace in-house or custom solutions, which are costly to maintain and often lack DocuSign's extensive auditability. The third new product is DocuSign Identify. It allows the company to automate the verification of government-issued IDs and European eID for transactions that require them. For example, opening a bank account would normally require the signer to physically present a photo ID. DocuSign ID verification allows this process to be digitized and automated, enabling signers to verify their identity on a mobile device from practically anywhere. So, when you put all this together, we believe that the DocuSign Agreement Cloud defines an entirely new category of cloud software, one that complements the marketing, sales, HR, ERP, and other cloud categories that already exists, connecting them all into agreement processing. To give you a customer example, one of the world's largest companies is using several products in the DocuSign Agreement Cloud together. They're using DocuSign eSignature, SpringCM, DocuSign for Salesforce, and our integration with SAP. This system is now live in 43 countries and over $70 billion worth of agreements flow through it annually. It's allowed the customer to cut the time it takes to get an agreement completed by about 80%, saving hundreds of millions of dollars as a result. We are seeing more and more examples like this all the time. And with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, we are excited to have the product suite that can fulfill them. So, to summarize; overall, we posted a solid first quarter for fiscal 2020. Revenue growth, profitability, and customer accounts were all strong. And we are seeing benefits from the work done to optimize our go-to-market processes. We have confidence in the rest of the fiscal year given the demand for our core eSignature offering remains strong and customers are expressing early interest in our expanded product offering. And, finally, we have positioned the DocuSign Agreement Cloud to be the next must-have cloud, providing us with an opportunity to deliver even more value to customers, while significantly expanding our TAM. One other item I wanted to mention, you will see in our 10,-Q some ongoing patent litigation with a company called RPost in the Eastern District of Texas. This trial is currently scheduled for mid-July. Essentially, RPost is claiming that we and several other technology companies, including our competitors are infringing on RPost patents covering certified email delivery. DocuSign believes that its services do not infringe because they operate differently from the RPost patent. Two federal judges have already held portions of the RPost patent to be invalid and DocuSign has asked the court of Texas to follow the same reasoning. As a result, DocuSign believes it has strong legal position and we are defending this litigation vigorously. Finally, I want to mention that we are hosting over 1,500 of our customers, partners and developers next week at our annual Momentum user conference in San Francisco. We're really looking forward to sharing the DocuSign Agreement Cloud vision with the group and hearing more on how we can make them successful. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mike to walk through our financials in greater detail. Mike?\nMichael Sheridan: Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. First, let me remind you that the non-GAAP financial results that I will discuss on this call exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and the amortization of debt discount. We began fiscal 2020 with a good first quarter, in which we generated strong top line growth from all of our global regions and increased our profitability and cash flow. Our total revenue rose 37% year-over-year to $214 million, with subscription revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $201 million. Our international revenue growth was particularly strong. Total international revenues came in at $38 million in the first quarter, which is a growth rate of 45% year-over-year. International revenues from our core DocuSign products exceeded this rate year-over-year. First quarter billings increased 27% year-over-year to $215 million. Included in this growth was a strong start in customers purchasing multiproduct solutions of eSignature, together with document generation and CLM products. Multiproduct sales involve more complexity in terms of integration designs and related SOWs. This very positive motion in our business also elongated some of our upsell cycles this quarter for existing customers wanting to deploy our expanded offerings. This extended sales cycle impacted our billings in dollar net retention in Q1. With that said, our existing customers continued to expand their deployments of our product offerings, leading to a dollar net retention of 112%. We added a total of approximately 31,000 new customers this quarter, of which 4,000 were new direct customers. This is a very strong 33% increase in our commercial and enterprise installed base. We now have 508,000 total customers and 60,000 direct customers worldwide. Customers with ACV greater than $300,000 grew 51% year-over-year to bring the total to 324 customers. This strong growth is indicative of our continued expansion among our installed base as customers extend existing use cases and add new ones. Gross margin for the first quarter was 79% compared to 80% in the same quarter last year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 86%, which is consistent with last year. Our operating leverage continued to improve in Q1. Operating expenses for the quarter were $160 million or 75% of total revenue compared to $121 million or 77% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating income for the first quarter was $10 million or 5% operating margin, which compares to $5 million or a 3% operating margin in Q1 of fiscal 2019. We ended Q1 with 3,219 employees, a year-over-year increase of 36%. Turning to cash flow, we had a particularly strong collections in the quarter. And as a result, we generated $46 million in operating cash flow compared with $15 million in Q1 of last year, and free cash flow of $30 million compared to $9 million in the prior year.  We had forecasted some of these collections in Q1 to occur in Q2, so we expect our Q2 collections to be lower than our historical averages. Overall, we believe our cash flow was a strong indicator of the improving leverage in our business. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter and full-year fiscal 2020. We estimate, number one, that revenue will reach $218 million to $222 million in Q2 and $917 million to $922 million for fiscal 2020; and, number two, billings will range between $215 million to $225 million in Q2 and $1.010 billion to $1.030 billion for fiscal 2020. We expect gross margin to be 78% to 80% for Q2 and the fiscal year. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues in Q2 and fiscal 2020, R&D in the range of 15% to 17% for Q2 and fiscal 2020, and G&A in the range of 10% to 14% for Q2 and 10% to 13% for fiscal 2020. This broader range of guidance for G&A expenses anticipates up to $10 million of expenses related to the RPost litigation that Dan mentioned in his remarks. For the second quarter, we expect $3 million to $4 million of interest in other non-operating income, including interest income and expense associated with the convertible debt. And for fiscal 2020, we expect interest and non-operating income of $12 million to $16 million. We expect a tax provision of approximately $2 million to $2.2 million for the second quarter and $8 million to $10 million for fiscal 2020. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 185 million to 190 million shares for Q2 and 190 million to 195 million shares for fiscal 2020. In closing, I am pleased with our start to fiscal 2020, in particular as it relates to early momentum and customer interest in our expanded product offerings. We believe that we are entering Q2 with growing momentum in our global markets. Thanks again for joining us today and we can now go to Q&A.\nOperator: Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question here is from Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to dive into the comment about elongated sales cycles on the upsell opportunity. Can you give us a little bit more color? What is it specifically that's causing \u2013 is it a decision process on the customer? What can you do to possibly shorten it again? And how is that actually also impacting subscription revenue?\nDaniel Springer: Sure. Sterling, I think what happens is, we were a single-product company, and we're moving to a broader platform and a multi-product company. And so, when we have the opportunity, which we're excited about to sell people a broader suite, there are more people that are involved. I can give you a specific example, the large bank customer in Europe. And normally, we would have had a more straightforward eSignature only. They were interested in also looking at some of the CLM capabilities of Spring, and as we got to the sort of end of the quarter, we realized our normal sort of pacing and process would take longer and the deal to close 10 days after the end of the quarter. But going into the quarter, we would have expected in a traditional eSignature sales cycle a single product, fewer signatures required, et cetera, and that it will be faster. So, that's kind of what we tend to see. In terms of your question of making that go faster, I actually want to have more and more of our deals have the multi-product capability. I do think there's an opportunity for us to continually improve on the enablement we do of our sales force. And remember, this is still new for a lot of folks, move from a single product to a multi-product model, but enable them to, one, be able to forecast better, but also to be able to accelerate that process. And from a standpoint in terms of the revenue growth, Mike, you want to chat a little bit about that?\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. Sterling, in terms of subscription revenue, these product sets are pretty much all subscription products. So, the timing of the ultimate booking or billing will impact the starting point of the revenue, but in terms of mix and everything else that you have modeled, it doesn't really have any impact.\nSterling Auty: Okay, great. And then, one follow-up question. The services revenue, I know it's small in terms of overall, but second straight quarter that it's up nicely relative to expectations. What's driving the upside in services?\nDaniel Springer: One of the pieces there is, if you think about the new products that we're selling, they generally require a statement of work for implementation, because again of the CLM capability. That software is fantastic, but it's not honed and it is as easy to use and implement as the DocuSign eSignature capability, which requires a lot less. So, we do expect there will be some increases in demand there. I would like to point out that we're very committed to our partner strategy, and one of our aspirations is to take a lot of that, that demand for services and to leverage the partner network. So, I wouldn't want to set the expectation that you should see some sort of exponential growth in our services revenue. We would still like to leverage the partner channel.\nSterling Auty: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Please go head.\nKarl Keirstead: Hi, thank you. Maybe I've got two on the same subject just around the sales cycles. So, maybe the first one is for you, Michael. So, in Q1, the reported billings was a little bit worse sequential growth than we saw in Q1 last year. And I'm sure it's for the reasons you mentioned. If I take the high end of the July quarter guidance, it's actually seasonally stronger than 2Q last year. So, one might infer that the deals such as the one that Dan mentioned like maybe they spilled into 2Q and you're banking on them closing. So, fundamentally, we're talking about a 1Q to 2Q shift. Is there any credence to that? And then, yeah, maybe I'll stop there and I'll ask my follow-up once you're done. Thanks.\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah, Karl. I think that, to the extent that we have a longer sales cycle, you would expect that, in any quarter, some of those are going to shift out of quarter. I would tell you that it's not a one quarter phenomenon. I think as we continue to be successful with these multi-product deals, that same sales cycle will also be relevant at the end of Q2 or at the end of Q3. Over time, I think, to Dan's point, with enablement and other factors, we will continue to get a better and improved motion around these kinds of deals. But I wouldn't look at it as just a factor at the end of a particular quarter. It will be time as we continue to transition into these larger deals.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. And then, maybe my follow-up is just clarity on what exactly customers are considering that's causing the delays because if what you're referring to is are the SpringCM deals, you've given us enough disclosures that we know that that generally represents sub 10% of billings and maybe even sub 5% of billings. So, at first blush, these additional SpringCM products don't seem to be a large enough portion of the total deal conversation to cause a slip, but maybe there is a flaw on that logic. If you could clarify. Thanks.\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. And I would first tell you that, I agree, I don't think we've had a slip. I think this is right in line with how we've seen our business and how we're guiding it. But if you look at a couple of things, Karl, if you break this down into new customers and then expansion of existing relationships, you can tell from our new customer growth that continues \u2013 that's going to largely be eSignature business.  On these upsells, what we're seeing is customers that already have eSignature are looking to us to, A, expand that eSignature relationship as they have in the past, but now they're coming back to us at a level that we're actually very encouraged about as sort of the first full quarter of being integrated, coming back to us saying we're really interested in your document generation technology, we're really interested in your CLM technology. So, these aren't just pure deals of a new product. It's the combination of the two that if \u2013 as I think Dan mentioned, if it remained just an eSignature expansion deal, well, those are pretty much close at a regular cadence. When it expands into, yes, we want to do that, but we also want to consider now deploying these other products into our solution set, that combination is what's causing us to take a little more time to bring them to closure. Dan mentioned statements of work, for example. That would, in a combined deal, be a step in the process that's a little bit different than if it was just a pure single product eSignature kind of transaction.\nDaniel Springer: The only thing I would add to that, Karl, it's not exclusively SpringCM. If we talk about the overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud, there is partner sale opportunities like Seal Software where we just made an investment in them as you recall, Intelledox, some of our other partner stories. So, there is a broader set than just the Spring component.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. Thank you both for that.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Yeah, sorry. Just on the same line of topics, can we maybe talk about just how many deals are we talking about here that kind of are taking longer? And any sense for \u2013 just if you can give a frame for us kind of the amount of time you expected it to take from a sales cycle perspective, how many months is that now taking for the new sales cycle? And then, I've got a quick follow-up.\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. Alex, I would tell you that you shouldn't look at this as some dramatic change in our overall business model. I think this is our first full quarter bringing these products to market in an integrated basis. I think that, over time, it's going to normalize. And I think, over time, those sales cycles will improve. But we don't want to overstate anything. We feel very good about the bookings and the billings that occurred within the quarter. And as we've talked about in the past, there's lots of factors that affect billing. So, we always want to encourage everybody to look at that one statistic in the context of all others. But if you look out longer term, I don't see this as any kind of major shift in how you should be reading our guidance or our business model going forward.\nDaniel Springer: Yeah. I think that's exactly right. And then, just to your specific question, I gave the one example of the large bank with 10 days. If you want to think about the time of that elongation, 10 days past the end of the quarter before that one then came through in May.  I don't know that there's an exact answer of sort of what percent or what time frame we think. I think as we get more and more experience, we'll start to be able to put more data and more clarity to what that expectation would be. But I think the key point that Mike made is we're not looking at this as problematic. We're looking at this as a positive trend that people want to buy more from us. They're buying into the Agreement Cloud. And now, our responsibility is to get our sales force enabled to a position where it becomes our regular sales motion. And that's sort of where we are today.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And then, maybe can you just comment on the quality of the pipeline and the competitive landscape? Are you seeing \u2013 is there any sense of some of these deals are taking longer because of volatility of the macro or just maybe level set for us what you're seeing from that regard?\nDaniel Springer: Yeah. I think we see the market, broadly defined, competitive set, economic environment unchanged from where we've been the last several quarters. Obviously, we read the papers as do you and we see sort of the trade issues that are out there, but we haven't actually seen anything in our business that suggests there's a different sort of buying enthusiasm or capacity or demand for our products. The one thing we highlighted here, to try to give you more insight color, is the demand for the multi-product is sort of changing a little bit the way we're going to market in terms of that cycle. We haven't seen anything else again from a competitive or market dynamic that's changed at all in the last several quarters.\nAlex Zukin: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Furby from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJustin Furby: Thanks, guys. Maybe just to start, for Dan or Mike, you've had a quarter now of some of these deals and some of them have closed and some have pushed, but can you give a sense for what it looks like in terms of uplift or what the opportunity is when it just moves from pure eSignature to a broader document cloud deal and how you expect it to unfold over the next few quarters?\nDaniel Springer: Yeah. So, I think the answer is it's quite varied. I think there is some situations where people are significant eSignature customers of ours and they say, 'hey, we want to sort of dabble a little bit some of these other exciting pieces of capability you have across the Agreement Cloud.' We have other situations where people are coming to us saying, 'hey, this is a core functionality in terms of something like a CLM capability or like sort of intelligent search which comes in our managed phase through our partnership with Seal, and that's a core piece of the agreement. So, it really does vary dramatically. I don't think we have a data set yet where we can give you a sort of percentage of the other component. But one thing I would steer you toward is, if you think about the past when we talked about the TAM, because that's a lot of the way we look at this, is this really increase of our TAM. And if we \u2013 before talked about the signature TAM was around $25 billion. When you look at the total complete agreement cloud, we talk about that as sort of a doubling opportunity in the TAM. Now, the pieces that we've filled out to date aren't the comprehensive agreement cloud. So, we think that's the longer term thing to shoot for, but we think we're making real progress towards increasing our capabilities. That's sort of how we're looking at it.\nMichael Sheridan: And just one thing I would add to Dan's point about variety, one of the positives that we saw in the quarter was we thought that, at the beginning, document generation and CLM would really be something that initially would be more of the larger side of our customer base interest. We actually saw interest that penetrated more deeply into the small and mid than our initial expectations. So, in that point of variety, that was a positive development of it.\nJustin Furby: Got it. And then, Dan, can you comment more on the sales changes? When is that completed? And does it cause any \u2013 what is the risk of a disruption as you go through that process? And I've got one just quick follow-up. Thanks.\nDaniel Springer: Absolutely. Yeah, we feel really good. As I mentioned, last year, we started with our smaller commercial customers. Sometimes [indiscernible] the term SMB where we sort of experimented and tested this model of really separating those, going after newco versus those selling to the base. And we were quite pleased with those results. And so, we've rolled that out more broadly into our commercial and enterprise group in Q1 of this year. And again, as I said, we feel really excited. If you take a look at the direct new customer adds, those were quite strong this quarter and we feel really good about that focus on newco. One of the things we've long talked about is, if you do take folks that are selling across both and dedicate a significant portion of those resources to newco, some of the lower hanging fruit might not get that same attention in terms of the upsell opportunities and that was one of the things we want to be mindful of, but based on what we saw in Q1, again, with particularly the strong success on newco, we feel very comfortable that we've baked in the right changes. And I don't think you should expect any significant model changes going forward.\nJustin Furby: Great. And that's helpful. And then, Mike, just for you. The retention, if you look at it on a gross basis in terms of gross churn across your business, did it stay consistent? Any changes there? Thanks.\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. I think the only thing I would point to on the dollar net retention is, obviously, we are talking about some of the upsell transactions which affect that statistic. Otherwise, I wouldn't see anything underlying statistics within the business that was out of the norm.\nJustin Furby: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question here is from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much for taking my questions. And maybe just follow-up on Justin's question a second ago. So, as these larger deals, with SpringCM included, start to close, could we start to see net revenue retention start to trend up more towards the historical ranges that you've seen more in the 114% to 115% range as we go through the year?\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. Hi, Stan. I would tell you that \u2013 I would reiterate the 112% to 119% we've always talked about. But, yes, I think that there's an opportunity for us to have that move into the more historical kind of mid-teens kind of range.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Perfect. And then, just on the new Agreement Cloud and all the associated products, such as the ID product that you're bringing to market, how are you thinking about selling these products and brands to market and when do you think they would really start to catch traction and we can start to see them become a more material part of the broader story? Thank you.\nDaniel Springer: Well, in terms of the go-to-market, as I mentioned before, we really are taking a strategy of enabling our core sales force to be able to sell the broader Agreement Cloud and the pieces there. We do have subject matter experts that we bring to support, the same way you might think about a solutions consultant providing the technical support of our existing eSignature. And we have overlay model capability as well in a situation like with Spring, where we do an acquisition and we want to bring that expertise to market and support our existing AEs. But I think you're going to see us continue to do that as that [indiscernible] core AE market. And in terms of a sense of timing, it's early days. I don't think you should expect to see us breaking out sort of revenue impact from different product lines in the foreseeable future. But we have plans in place to show revenue this year from these businesses and we think it can be a significant part of our business going forward.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nShankar Subramanian: Hi. This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. So, I have a follow-up on the sales cycle. Was there any particular vertical or geography where this set of extension that has happened or it's just more broad based?\nMichael Sheridan: I think it has more to do with the combination of the products, Shankar, than it does with any kind of geography or vertical.\nDaniel Springer: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to it is it would skew, obviously, to larger customers. So, if you see the place where we had our greatest strength through this particular quarter, with the first quarter of really sort of having this expanded capability in place, the smaller commercial business was particularly strong. So, the impact from a delay standpoint was skewed towards larger, but that's the only thing I'd say. And again, when we look across the quarter and we looked across the mix, we're pretty pleased with the results as we introduce the new functionality and the new capability that the underlying demand we see from the marketplace is a positive. So, we see this as an important supporting evidence that the DocuSign Agreement Cloud is absolutely the right way for us to go and continue that successful march into becoming a multi-product company.\nShankar Subramanian: Got it. On the new customers and the ACV that you sell to a new customer, when you land with a new customer, have you seen a trend where you land at a much higher ACV than [indiscernible] one or two years ago? And when you think about the land and expand strategy, how long does it take for a customer to go from one use case to the hundreds of use cases you talked about? Is it more a one to three-year kind of window or is it a much longer time frame?\nDaniel Springer: Well, the land and expand timing, we don't see that having changed. We haven't seen the ACVs fundamentally different, either in the last several years or anything specifically in the last quarter. So, I don't expect that to change. I think that core motion that we're excited about is going to stay quite constant. And in terms of the time it takes for that to sort of expand, it really does vary quite a bit. In general, I would just tell you that, particularly for a larger customer, there does tend to be a sort of half year to year of them really getting adopted with the first set of use cases that they bring DocuSign in for. And then, after that, it's quite a variation where some, within a year, have dramatically expanded and some do take three, four years before they get to be at scale.\nMichael Sheridan: And, Shankar, the one thing I'd say about that initial land, a lot of that comment that Dan just made is by design. Our focus when we land a new customer is to size that initial deployment at a level that we have great confidence that they can adopt it. We have a lot of resources focused on that initial adoption. If we try to push deal sizes, the initial motion, it increases our risk of churn. This is a lesson we've learned over many years. So, we really do try to right-size those initial deployments, so we get a strong foothold that leads to the expansion over time.\nShankar Subramanian: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Next question is from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead.\nWalter Pritchard: Thanks. Another question just on the expansion rate. I guess if we go back a number of quarters ago, you were pushing expansion rates toward the higher end of that range that you mentioned, Mike, and you didn't have the other products there. And so, I'm wondering, as you sort of dissect the expansion rate you're seeing right now, is there any change in the expansion you're seeing just simply from customers rolling out additional use cases and footprint of the e-sign capability? And then, just as a follow-up to what somebody else asked, you would think you might be able to get up towards the higher end of your expansion rate having the ability now to layer in new products. So, just wanted to maybe understand the dynamics within the expansion rate and where that could go.\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. Walter, two things. One, I would say, if you look out over several quarters, I think our \u2013 like our four-quarter, six-quarter rolling averages, like a 114-ish kind of level, so we have had moments where it has peaked above that, but it's generally been in those mid-teens. So, I wouldn't want to have you think that it was something more like at the high end of that range. It's been more in the mid. And as I had responded earlier to a prior comment, I think you're right, we do expect that, in coming quarters, you'll see as we get these new products integrated into our sales cycles and so forth, we should see that rate move into those ranges over time.\nWalter Pritchard: And then, Mike, on the international revenue, you saw that uptick. I know you have had a bit of a headwind there and you commented that the core is growing faster than the reported number. Can you help us understand where you are in working through those headwinds and when we should see the international no longer dragged down by some of those products you discontinued in Brazil and so forth?\nMichael Sheridan: Yeah. So, clearly, what you would see from this quarter, is that the gap is \u2013 with the combined being above 40%, compared to last year, we had quarters more in like the mid to high 20 percentiles where our core was growing higher than 40%. That was a wider gap. So, I think we're entering this fiscal year with much of that sun-setting of legacy products already accomplished. There's still some of it. But I don't think what you'll see in the quarters coming is the kinds of impact and separation that you've seen in prior quarters. I think we're much closer to normalization around that now.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nMark Chen: Hi. This is Mark for Pat. Thank you so much for taking my question. Mike, you mentioned that the international revenue was particularly strong. And just wondering what are some factors that drive the strong growth and which region contributed the most.\nMichael Sheridan: Yes. So, thanks. I think both our Asia-Pacific region, as well as Europe contributed. I think that Europe was probably a bit stronger, but that probably has to do with the fact that we've just a bit more \u2013 we have more infrastructure in place in Europe and so forth. We've been there longer. But I think most of the growth is coming from markets that are newer than the US and we're getting very good traction. I will say, in this theme of multi-products, we saw that same phenomenon in our international customers as well. So, that has been a global positive movement for us. I'd also say that, in Brazil, which is a little bit ahead of other international countries in terms of their adoption of digital technologies, we saw good strength there as well.\nMark Chen: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments.\nDaniel Springer: Thank you, guys, all very much for joining us. We look forward to seeing, hopefully, a bunch of you at the Momentum conference next week and then at upcoming events. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",

            "name": "Michael Sheridan",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. First, let me remind you that the non-GAAP financial results that I will discuss on this call exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and the amortization of debt discount. We began fiscal 2020 with a good first quarter, in which we generated strong top line growth from all of our global regions and increased our profitability and cash flow. Our total revenue rose 37% year-over-year to $214 million, with subscription revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $201 million. Our international revenue growth was particularly strong. Total international revenues came in at $38 million in the first quarter, which is a growth rate of 45% year-over-year. International revenues from our core DocuSign products exceeded this rate year-over-year. First quarter billings increased 27% year-over-year to $215 million. Included in this growth was a strong start in customers purchasing multiproduct solutions of eSignature, together with document generation and CLM products. Multiproduct sales involve more complexity in terms of integration designs and related SOWs. This very positive motion in our business also elongated some of our upsell cycles this quarter for existing customers wanting to deploy our expanded offerings. This extended sales cycle impacted our billings in dollar net retention in Q1. With that said, our existing customers continued to expand their deployments of our product offerings, leading to a dollar net retention of 112%. We added a total of approximately 31,000 new customers this quarter, of which 4,000 were new direct customers. This is a very strong 33% increase in our commercial and enterprise installed base. We now have 508,000 total customers and 60,000 direct customers worldwide. Customers with ACV greater than $300,000 grew 51% year-over-year to bring the total to 324 customers. This strong growth is indicative of our continued expansion among our installed base as customers extend existing use cases and add new ones. Gross margin for the first quarter was 79% compared to 80% in the same quarter last year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 86%, which is consistent with last year. Our operating leverage continued to improve in Q1. Operating expenses for the quarter were $160 million or 75% of total revenue compared to $121 million or 77% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating income for the first quarter was $10 million or 5% operating margin, which compares to $5 million or a 3% operating margin in Q1 of fiscal 2019. We ended Q1 with 3,219 employees, a year-over-year increase of 36%. Turning to cash flow, we had a particularly strong collections in the quarter. And as a result, we generated $46 million in operating cash flow compared with $15 million in Q1 of last year, and free cash flow of $30 million compared to $9 million in the prior year.  We had forecasted some of these collections in Q1 to occur in Q2, so we expect our Q2 collections to be lower than our historical averages. Overall, we believe our cash flow was a strong indicator of the improving leverage in our business. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter and full-year fiscal 2020. We estimate, number one, that revenue will reach $218 million to $222 million in Q2 and $917 million to $922 million for fiscal 2020; and, number two, billings will range between $215 million to $225 million in Q2 and $1.010 billion to $1.030 billion for fiscal 2020. We expect gross margin to be 78% to 80% for Q2 and the fiscal year. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues in Q2 and fiscal 2020, R&D in the range of 15% to 17% for Q2 and fiscal 2020, and G&A in the range of 10% to 14% for Q2 and 10% to 13% for fiscal 2020. This broader range of guidance for G&A expenses anticipates up to $10 million of expenses related to the RPost litigation that Dan mentioned in his remarks. For the second quarter, we expect $3 million to $4 million of interest in other non-operating income, including interest income and expense associated with the convertible debt. And for fiscal 2020, we expect interest and non-operating income of $12 million to $16 million. We expect a tax provision of approximately $2 million to $2.2 million for the second quarter and $8 million to $10 million for fiscal 2020. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 185 million to 190 million shares for Q2 and 190 million to 195 million shares for fiscal 2020. In closing, I am pleased with our start to fiscal 2020, in particular as it relates to early momentum and customer interest in our expanded product offerings. We believe that we are entering Q2 with growing momentum in our global markets. Thanks again for joining us today and we can now go to Q&A. Yeah. Sterling, in terms of subscription revenue, these product sets are pretty much all subscription products. So, the timing of the ultimate booking or billing will impact the starting point of the revenue, but in terms of mix and everything else that you have modeled, it doesn't really have any impact. Yeah, Karl. I think that, to the extent that we have a longer sales cycle, you would expect that, in any quarter, some of those are going to shift out of quarter. I would tell you that it's not a one quarter phenomenon. I think as we continue to be successful with these multi-product deals, that same sales cycle will also be relevant at the end of Q2 or at the end of Q3. Over time, I think, to Dan's point, with enablement and other factors, we will continue to get a better and improved motion around these kinds of deals. But I wouldn't look at it as just a factor at the end of a particular quarter. It will be time as we continue to transition into these larger deals. Yeah. And I would first tell you that, I agree, I don't think we've had a slip. I think this is right in line with how we've seen our business and how we're guiding it. But if you look at a couple of things, Karl, if you break this down into new customers and then expansion of existing relationships, you can tell from our new customer growth that continues \u2013 that's going to largely be eSignature business.  On these upsells, what we're seeing is customers that already have eSignature are looking to us to, A, expand that eSignature relationship as they have in the past, but now they're coming back to us at a level that we're actually very encouraged about as sort of the first full quarter of being integrated, coming back to us saying we're really interested in your document generation technology, we're really interested in your CLM technology. So, these aren't just pure deals of a new product. It's the combination of the two that if \u2013 as I think Dan mentioned, if it remained just an eSignature expansion deal, well, those are pretty much close at a regular cadence. When it expands into, yes, we want to do that, but we also want to consider now deploying these other products into our solution set, that combination is what's causing us to take a little more time to bring them to closure. Dan mentioned statements of work, for example. That would, in a combined deal, be a step in the process that's a little bit different than if it was just a pure single product eSignature kind of transaction. Yeah. Alex, I would tell you that you shouldn't look at this as some dramatic change in our overall business model. I think this is our first full quarter bringing these products to market in an integrated basis. I think that, over time, it's going to normalize. And I think, over time, those sales cycles will improve. But we don't want to overstate anything. We feel very good about the bookings and the billings that occurred within the quarter. And as we've talked about in the past, there's lots of factors that affect billing. So, we always want to encourage everybody to look at that one statistic in the context of all others. But if you look out longer term, I don't see this as any kind of major shift in how you should be reading our guidance or our business model going forward. And just one thing I would add to Dan's point about variety, one of the positives that we saw in the quarter was we thought that, at the beginning, document generation and CLM would really be something that initially would be more of the larger side of our customer base interest. We actually saw interest that penetrated more deeply into the small and mid than our initial expectations. So, in that point of variety, that was a positive development of it. Yeah. I think the only thing I would point to on the dollar net retention is, obviously, we are talking about some of the upsell transactions which affect that statistic. Otherwise, I wouldn't see anything underlying statistics within the business that was out of the norm. Yeah. Hi, Stan. I would tell you that \u2013 I would reiterate the 112% to 119% we've always talked about. But, yes, I think that there's an opportunity for us to have that move into the more historical kind of mid-teens kind of range. I think it has more to do with the combination of the products, Shankar, than it does with any kind of geography or vertical. And, Shankar, the one thing I'd say about that initial land, a lot of that comment that Dan just made is by design. Our focus when we land a new customer is to size that initial deployment at a level that we have great confidence that they can adopt it. We have a lot of resources focused on that initial adoption. If we try to push deal sizes, the initial motion, it increases our risk of churn. This is a lesson we've learned over many years. So, we really do try to right-size those initial deployments, so we get a strong foothold that leads to the expansion over time. Yeah. Walter, two things. One, I would say, if you look out over several quarters, I think our \u2013 like our four-quarter, six-quarter rolling averages, like a 114-ish kind of level, so we have had moments where it has peaked above that, but it's generally been in those mid-teens. So, I wouldn't want to have you think that it was something more like at the high end of that range. It's been more in the mid. And as I had responded earlier to a prior comment, I think you're right, we do expect that, in coming quarters, you'll see as we get these new products integrated into our sales cycles and so forth, we should see that rate move into those ranges over time. Yeah. So, clearly, what you would see from this quarter, is that the gap is \u2013 with the combined being above 40%, compared to last year, we had quarters more in like the mid to high 20 percentiles where our core was growing higher than 40%. That was a wider gap. So, I think we're entering this fiscal year with much of that sun-setting of legacy products already accomplished. There's still some of it. But I don't think what you'll see in the quarters coming is the kinds of impact and separation that you've seen in prior quarters. I think we're much closer to normalization around that now. Yes. So, thanks. I think both our Asia-Pacific region, as well as Europe contributed. I think that Europe was probably a bit stronger, but that probably has to do with the fact that we've just a bit more \u2013 we have more infrastructure in place in Europe and so forth. We've been there longer. But I think most of the growth is coming from markets that are newer than the US and we're getting very good traction. I will say, in this theme of multi-products, we saw that same phenomenon in our international customers as well. So, that has been a global positive movement for us. I'd also say that, in Brazil, which is a little bit ahead of other international countries in terms of their adoption of digital technologies, we saw good strength there as well."

            "name": "Daniel Springer",
            "content": "Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 earnings call today. I'd like to start by highlighting some of the quarter's results and then go into announcements we made this quarter around our DocuSign Agreement Cloud suite of products. Let me start with financial results and a couple of key highlights. DocuSign began the year with solid top and bottom line results, marking our 6th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP earnings per share. First quarter revenue was $214 million, representing 37% growth year-over-year. We were again profitable on a non-GAAP basis with operating income of nearly $10 million or 5% for the quarter. We also had an exceptionally strong quarter in terms of cash flow, with $30 million of free cash flow. Two highlights stand out for me this quarter. The first is the announcement of the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. Our expanding product portfolio that addresses not just signing, but the entire agreement process both before and after that signature. I will talk more about this shortly, but this broader scope and deeper offering could significantly increase our TAM from the $25 billion eSignature TAM. Second highlight is the further rollout of specialized sales team focused on new customer acquisition while others will focus on the installed base. This is something we tested with great success last year and rolled out more broadly in North America this year. We are already seeing a net increase in new logos as well as the expansion of use cases within our existing customers. Overall, we are confident and excited about the year ahead, and the longer-term vision and opportunity for DocuSign. So, today, I'd like to share some more detail on two areas \u2013 the demand we are seeing for DocuSign eSignature and the strategic opportunity that the DocuSign Agreement Cloud represents. Let's first talk about the demand. We continue to see strong growth and leadership in our core eSignature solution across all segments and geographies. Let me share some numbers with you to give context. Our customer count continues to increase, and as of the end of Q1, we have almost 508,000 paying customers around the world. That's up from 405,000 in Q1 of fiscal year 2019. We continue to see growth in our international markets. In markets like the UK, France, Germany, Brazil, Australia, and Japan, we are just beginning to tap the potential. And no matter where our customers are based, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand the use of eSignature into other department. As has long been the case, once companies experience speed, time, and simplicity benefit of DocuSign eSignature, they are keen to replicate those results elsewhere in the enterprise. A great example of this is one of our global consumer packaged goods customer started with just a single eSignature use case in their human resources department, and just a few years later, they now have 100 use cases deployed or in development across multiple business units. We expect this pattern of use case expansion to continue driving revenue growth for the company for years to come. Now, let's talk about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, and our ability to automate and connect the entire agreement process. In March this year, we just announced the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, our expanding suite of more than a dozen products and over 350 integrations for digitally transforming how organizations prepare, sign, act on, and manage their agreements. The DocuSign Agreement Cloud includes our flagship eSignature product and several other DocuSign product offerings, as well as the recently acquired SpringCM offering for contract life cycle management, and the hundreds of integrations to other applications involved in the agreement process, such as those from Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and SAP. It also includes three new products that were announced after our last earnings call. So, I'd like to take a moment to highlight them today. The first is DocuSign Gen, designed for small to medium businesses, primarily in the salesforce ecosystem. Gen enables sales reps and other users to automatically generate signature-ready contracts with just a few clicks, and do it directly from within salesforce. This can result in faster deals, fewer errors, and greater productivity. The second new product is DocuSign Click. It allows organizations of any size to capture consent to standard agreement terms on websites such as a privacy policy with just a single click. These so-called, no-signature-required agreements are a new opportunity for DocuSign to replace in-house or custom solutions, which are costly to maintain and often lack DocuSign's extensive auditability. The third new product is DocuSign Identify. It allows the company to automate the verification of government-issued IDs and European eID for transactions that require them. For example, opening a bank account would normally require the signer to physically present a photo ID. DocuSign ID verification allows this process to be digitized and automated, enabling signers to verify their identity on a mobile device from practically anywhere. So, when you put all this together, we believe that the DocuSign Agreement Cloud defines an entirely new category of cloud software, one that complements the marketing, sales, HR, ERP, and other cloud categories that already exists, connecting them all into agreement processing. To give you a customer example, one of the world's largest companies is using several products in the DocuSign Agreement Cloud together. They're using DocuSign eSignature, SpringCM, DocuSign for Salesforce, and our integration with SAP. This system is now live in 43 countries and over $70 billion worth of agreements flow through it annually. It's allowed the customer to cut the time it takes to get an agreement completed by about 80%, saving hundreds of millions of dollars as a result. We are seeing more and more examples like this all the time. And with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, we are excited to have the product suite that can fulfill them. So, to summarize; overall, we posted a solid first quarter for fiscal 2020. Revenue growth, profitability, and customer accounts were all strong. And we are seeing benefits from the work done to optimize our go-to-market processes. We have confidence in the rest of the fiscal year given the demand for our core eSignature offering remains strong and customers are expressing early interest in our expanded product offering. And, finally, we have positioned the DocuSign Agreement Cloud to be the next must-have cloud, providing us with an opportunity to deliver even more value to customers, while significantly expanding our TAM. One other item I wanted to mention, you will see in our 10,-Q some ongoing patent litigation with a company called RPost in the Eastern District of Texas. This trial is currently scheduled for mid-July. Essentially, RPost is claiming that we and several other technology companies, including our competitors are infringing on RPost patents covering certified email delivery. DocuSign believes that its services do not infringe because they operate differently from the RPost patent. Two federal judges have already held portions of the RPost patent to be invalid and DocuSign has asked the court of Texas to follow the same reasoning. As a result, DocuSign believes it has strong legal position and we are defending this litigation vigorously. Finally, I want to mention that we are hosting over 1,500 of our customers, partners and developers next week at our annual Momentum user conference in San Francisco. We're really looking forward to sharing the DocuSign Agreement Cloud vision with the group and hearing more on how we can make them successful. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mike to walk through our financials in greater detail. Mike? Sure. Sterling, I think what happens is, we were a single-product company, and we're moving to a broader platform and a multi-product company. And so, when we have the opportunity, which we're excited about to sell people a broader suite, there are more people that are involved. I can give you a specific example, the large bank customer in Europe. And normally, we would have had a more straightforward eSignature only. They were interested in also looking at some of the CLM capabilities of Spring, and as we got to the sort of end of the quarter, we realized our normal sort of pacing and process would take longer and the deal to close 10 days after the end of the quarter. But going into the quarter, we would have expected in a traditional eSignature sales cycle a single product, fewer signatures required, et cetera, and that it will be faster. So, that's kind of what we tend to see. In terms of your question of making that go faster, I actually want to have more and more of our deals have the multi-product capability. I do think there's an opportunity for us to continually improve on the enablement we do of our sales force. And remember, this is still new for a lot of folks, move from a single product to a multi-product model, but enable them to, one, be able to forecast better, but also to be able to accelerate that process. And from a standpoint in terms of the revenue growth, Mike, you want to chat a little bit about that? One of the pieces there is, if you think about the new products that we're selling, they generally require a statement of work for implementation, because again of the CLM capability. That software is fantastic, but it's not honed and it is as easy to use and implement as the DocuSign eSignature capability, which requires a lot less. So, we do expect there will be some increases in demand there. I would like to point out that we're very committed to our partner strategy, and one of our aspirations is to take a lot of that, that demand for services and to leverage the partner network. So, I wouldn't want to set the expectation that you should see some sort of exponential growth in our services revenue. We would still like to leverage the partner channel. The only thing I would add to that, Karl, it's not exclusively SpringCM. If we talk about the overall DocuSign Agreement Cloud, there is partner sale opportunities like Seal Software where we just made an investment in them as you recall, Intelledox, some of our other partner stories. So, there is a broader set than just the Spring component. Yeah. I think that's exactly right. And then, just to your specific question, I gave the one example of the large bank with 10 days. If you want to think about the time of that elongation, 10 days past the end of the quarter before that one then came through in May.  I don't know that there's an exact answer of sort of what percent or what time frame we think. I think as we get more and more experience, we'll start to be able to put more data and more clarity to what that expectation would be. But I think the key point that Mike made is we're not looking at this as problematic. We're looking at this as a positive trend that people want to buy more from us. They're buying into the Agreement Cloud. And now, our responsibility is to get our sales force enabled to a position where it becomes our regular sales motion. And that's sort of where we are today. Yeah. I think we see the market, broadly defined, competitive set, economic environment unchanged from where we've been the last several quarters. Obviously, we read the papers as do you and we see sort of the trade issues that are out there, but we haven't actually seen anything in our business that suggests there's a different sort of buying enthusiasm or capacity or demand for our products. The one thing we highlighted here, to try to give you more insight color, is the demand for the multi-product is sort of changing a little bit the way we're going to market in terms of that cycle. We haven't seen anything else again from a competitive or market dynamic that's changed at all in the last several quarters. Yeah. So, I think the answer is it's quite varied. I think there is some situations where people are significant eSignature customers of ours and they say, 'hey, we want to sort of dabble a little bit some of these other exciting pieces of capability you have across the Agreement Cloud.' We have other situations where people are coming to us saying, 'hey, this is a core functionality in terms of something like a CLM capability or like sort of intelligent search which comes in our managed phase through our partnership with Seal, and that's a core piece of the agreement. So, it really does vary dramatically. I don't think we have a data set yet where we can give you a sort of percentage of the other component. But one thing I would steer you toward is, if you think about the past when we talked about the TAM, because that's a lot of the way we look at this, is this really increase of our TAM. And if we \u2013 before talked about the signature TAM was around $25 billion. When you look at the total complete agreement cloud, we talk about that as sort of a doubling opportunity in the TAM. Now, the pieces that we've filled out to date aren't the comprehensive agreement cloud. So, we think that's the longer term thing to shoot for, but we think we're making real progress towards increasing our capabilities. That's sort of how we're looking at it. Absolutely. Yeah, we feel really good. As I mentioned, last year, we started with our smaller commercial customers. Sometimes [indiscernible] the term SMB where we sort of experimented and tested this model of really separating those, going after newco versus those selling to the base. And we were quite pleased with those results. And so, we've rolled that out more broadly into our commercial and enterprise group in Q1 of this year. And again, as I said, we feel really excited. If you take a look at the direct new customer adds, those were quite strong this quarter and we feel really good about that focus on newco. One of the things we've long talked about is, if you do take folks that are selling across both and dedicate a significant portion of those resources to newco, some of the lower hanging fruit might not get that same attention in terms of the upsell opportunities and that was one of the things we want to be mindful of, but based on what we saw in Q1, again, with particularly the strong success on newco, we feel very comfortable that we've baked in the right changes. And I don't think you should expect any significant model changes going forward. Well, in terms of the go-to-market, as I mentioned before, we really are taking a strategy of enabling our core sales force to be able to sell the broader Agreement Cloud and the pieces there. We do have subject matter experts that we bring to support, the same way you might think about a solutions consultant providing the technical support of our existing eSignature. And we have overlay model capability as well in a situation like with Spring, where we do an acquisition and we want to bring that expertise to market and support our existing AEs. But I think you're going to see us continue to do that as that [indiscernible] core AE market. And in terms of a sense of timing, it's early days. I don't think you should expect to see us breaking out sort of revenue impact from different product lines in the foreseeable future. But we have plans in place to show revenue this year from these businesses and we think it can be a significant part of our business going forward. Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to it is it would skew, obviously, to larger customers. So, if you see the place where we had our greatest strength through this particular quarter, with the first quarter of really sort of having this expanded capability in place, the smaller commercial business was particularly strong. So, the impact from a delay standpoint was skewed towards larger, but that's the only thing I'd say. And again, when we look across the quarter and we looked across the mix, we're pretty pleased with the results as we introduce the new functionality and the new capability that the underlying demand we see from the marketplace is a positive. So, we see this as an important supporting evidence that the DocuSign Agreement Cloud is absolutely the right way for us to go and continue that successful march into becoming a multi-product company. Well, the land and expand timing, we don't see that having changed. We haven't seen the ACVs fundamentally different, either in the last several years or anything specifically in the last quarter. So, I don't expect that to change. I think that core motion that we're excited about is going to stay quite constant. And in terms of the time it takes for that to sort of expand, it really does vary quite a bit. In general, I would just tell you that, particularly for a larger customer, there does tend to be a sort of half year to year of them really getting adopted with the first set of use cases that they bring DocuSign in for. And then, after that, it's quite a variation where some, within a year, have dramatically expanded and some do take three, four years before they get to be at scale. Thank you, guys, all very much for joining us. We look forward to seeing, hopefully, a bunch of you at the Momentum conference next week and then at upcoming events. Thanks."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call for fiscal 2021. Before we get to our results, I want to acknowledge that it's been almost a year to the day since we shifted our business operations and day-to-day lives in response to the pandemic. Over that time, COVID-19 has created huge challenges and disruptions for almost everyone, everywhere. Ones we're all still dealing with today. But amid those challenges, people found ways to keep life and work moving forward. As a team, DocuSign was honored to play a role supporting people all over the world as they responded to the pandemic. We gained new customers, we expanded our relationship with others, and we saw a surge in adoption of our products as accelerating a trend already underway, the digital transformation of agreements. This transformation not only allows agreements to be prepared, signed, act on and manage from anywhere, it also allows greater speed and efficiency than manual paper-based processes. As a result, we don't believe our new or expanded customers will be going back to paper, even after the pandemic recedes. We also don't believe life will go back to the way it was before. Of course, many in-person activities will be welcome back. But, when people found better ways during the pandemic, we believe those will continue and flourish, whether it's total or partial work from home, virtual visits to medical professionals or getting a document notarized remotely. Ultimately, over the coming years, we think the trend will continue towards the option of doing anything from anywhere. We call the products and services supporting this trend, the \u2018anywhere economy\u2019. We believe we're a key pillar, and it's only just beginning. You'll hear more from us about this in the coming weeks. With that, we have a lot to share around Q4 and our full fiscal year. So, let's cover that in three parts: Our strong Q4 and record fiscal '21 results; how we think about our continued evolution into the Agreement Cloud company, and how the Agreement Cloud delivers value to our customers and partners. First, our results. Q4 was another strong quarter for us, contributing to a milestone year for DocuSign overall. We saw revenue growth of 57% and billings growth of 46% year-over-year. We welcomed more than 70,000 new customers, bringing the total to nearly 892,000 customers worldwide. And we saw our strongest expansion and upsell rates yet, driving our dollar net retention to a record 123%. For the year, we exited fiscal '21 nearly 50% bigger than we were in fiscal '20 with almost $1.5 billion in revenue. And our customer addition rate was more than double that of fiscal '20, edging us ever closer to the 1 million customer mark. By any measure, that's an astounding year. It's a testament to how people around the world are embracing digital technologies to transform the way they work and live. It's a reflection of the incredible opportunity that's still in its very early stages. And, it's all made possible by the dedication of the 5,600-person strong DocuSign team, who've gone above and beyond to help our customers this entire year. Of course, this is a journey, not a destination. So, as we think about the future and our continued evolution into the Agreement Cloud company, we're increasingly going to do so in the context of three primary goals. First, we want DocuSign to be the best way to agree to anything anywhere. We've recently made great additions to our leading eSignature product with identity proofing, click wrap, electronic witnessing and soon, remote online notary transactions. We want to extend the benefits of digital signing to all kinds of agreements in all walks of life. We're seeing this transformation accelerate. For example, one of our financial services customers in the U.S. came on board early last year as part of its COVID-19 response strategy. And they deployed DocuSign across more than 20 use cases in the past six months alone. So far, DocuSign has powered almost 100,000 transactions for their HR, procurement, customer service and in-branch onboarding needs. These transactions took less than a minute to complete on average, delivering a rapid ROI. And DocuSign went from a crisis response solution last year to a business as usual solution today. For our second goal, we want to digitally transform the entire agreement process, pre and post-signature. Over fiscal '21, we continue to innovate in CLM and to integrate our acquisitions of Seal Software and Liveoak Technologies. And you can expect us to drive automation at every stage of the agreement cycle, all the way from preparing and signing to acting on and managing. As an example, one of our Latin American agricultural customers needed to improve the management, corporate governance and turnaround time for its key contracts, and they needed a solution deployed across more than 30 subsidiaries in a matter of weeks. With DocuSign\u2019s CLM and eSignature together, handling the entire agreement process, this customer reduced the time it took to complete contracts from 23 days to just one hour. Third, we want to continue ensuring that DocuSign is embedded in the applications where work and life happen. We already integrate with more than 350 apps, including recent integrations with Slack, Microsoft Teams and Workplace from Facebook. And we have an award-winning API for custom integration, including with our customers' proprietary applications and processes. One of our global manufacturing customers is a good example of how DocuSign can integrate and interoperate with multiple applications within an enterprise. The customer needed to ensure that NDAs and other critical documents could be generated accurately, reviewed quickly and sent and signed easily. Today, after working with the DocuSign team, company has integrated DocuSign\u2019s CLM and eSignature with its CRM, productivity software and cloud storage systems to create the exact desired workflow, with all the speed, accuracy and efficiency benefits that come with it. So, as I bring my remarks to a close, it's clear that fiscal '21 was extraordinary on almost every level. As thrilled as I am about DocuSign's performance, I'm even more pleased that we are able to help our customers during this uniquely challenging time. And to say that I'm excited for the pandemic to start subsiding is of course an understatement. I'm also excited about DocuSign being well-positioned for the anywhere economy I mentioned earlier. It points to the incredible opportunity that's out there for us, given that the journey to a modern-day agreement process is being prioritized, like never before. The market is still in its early stages, so we will continue to invest in growth as our first priority as we expand and scale our business. Lastly, before I hand the call over to Cynthia, a reminder that we'll be talking more deeply about all of this at our upcoming annual Momentum conference and our inaugural Analyst Day on March 24. I look forward to seeing you all there, virtually. For now, over to Cynthia.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. In a monumental year, DocuSign helped many customers overcome challenges and transform their businesses to adapt to the new and changing environment. The strong demand for digital workflow accelerated our continued growth at scale and heightened our focus on execution and operations to meet our customers' needs. We capped off an exceptional year for DocuSign with strong results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, driven by robust new customer growth and expansions, primarily for our core eSignature offerings. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 57% year-over-year to $431 million, and subscription revenue grew 59% year-over-year to $410 million. For the full year, total revenue reached $1.45 billion, an increase of 49% over last year, and subscription revenue hit $1.38 billion, an increase of 50%. Our international revenue increased an impressive 83% year-over-year to $89 million in the fourth quarter, ticking up 21% of total revenue. For the full year, international revenue grew over 67% to $287 million, reflecting accelerated expansion across geographies. For the first time, we reached over $0.5 billion in quarterly billings as Q4 rose 46% year-over-year to $535 million. This resulted in a 56% trailing four-quarter average, consistent with last quarter's average. For the full year, billings increased $1.7 billion. Q4 customer additions continued at a robust pace as we added over 70,000 new customers. This brings our total installed base to nearly 892,000 customers worldwide, an increase of 51% over last year and more than double the number of new additions compared with fiscal '20. To give you a sense of the magnitude of this achievement, we added nearly the same number of customers this past year as we had in total at the time we went public, 15 years after the Company was founded. As part of this, we added 11,000 new direct customers in Q4 for a total of over 50,000 for the year. After more than doubling the number we added in fiscal '20, we ended the year with nearly 125,000 direct customers. For the third quarter in a row, we exceeded our historic dollar net retention range, hitting our highest level yet at 123% for Q4. Switching gears. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 80% compared with 79% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was 79%, consistent with fiscal '20. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. For the full year, subscription gross margin was 84%, consistent with fiscal '20. We saw significant improvement in our operating leverage as non-GAAP operating margin reached a record high of 17% or $75 million compared to 8% or $21 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, operating margin was 12%, a more than 7.5 percentage-point improvement over fiscal '20. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $77 million compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, net income was $182 million up from $59 million in fiscal '20. We ended the quarter with 5,630 employees, an increase of 44% over last year. In Q4, we took steps to put in place a more strategic and efficient capital structure. We issued $690 million in new 2024 convertible senior notes and paid down the majority of our existing 2023 convertible notes. We also put in place a new revolving credit facility, allowing us to borrow up to $500 million with additional capacity up to $750 million in total. While we are generating sufficient cash from our operations to fund our working capital needs, we believe this additional financial capacity, along with the attractive terms, will provide greater flexibility for our growth agenda. We exited fiscal '21 with $867 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Operating cash flow in fourth quarter was $62 million or 14% margin. This compares with $46 million or 17% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow was $44 million or 10% margin in the quarter compared to $16 million or 6% in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow more than doubled to $297 million or 20% compared to $116 million or 12% a year ago. And free cash flow grew to $215 million or 15% compared to $44 million or 4% in fiscal '20. These amounts include $75 million related to accounting for the extinguishment of the 2023 convertible notes. Excluding this, Q4 operating cash flow would have been $137 million or 32% margin, and free cash flow would have been $119 million or 28% margin. For the full year, operating cash flow would have been $372 million or 26% margin, and free cash flow would have been $290 million or 20% margin. This underscores the attractiveness of our model and the leverage we are seeing across the business. Now, on to our guidance. Coming into this fiscal year, we expect to see continued secular tailwinds in support of the anywhere economy. We are confident in our long-term trajectory and the untapped opportunity ahead. That being said, while our subscription-based model gives us a certain level of visibility, the impact of the pandemic adds an extra layer of complexity, which we are monitoring closely. With this backdrop, our approach to guidance continues to be to guide to what we know and can see in the current environment. As we begin the new fiscal year, we are guiding to non-GAAP operating margin going forward rather than individual operating expense lines to better align with how we are growing and scaling the business. For the first quarter in fiscal '22, we anticipate total revenue of $432 million to $436 million in Q1 or growth of 45% to 47% year-over-year, and $1.963 billion to $1.973 billion for fiscal '22 or growth of 35% to 36% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $415 million to $419 million in Q1 or growth of 48% to 49% year-over-year, and $1.886 billion to $1.896 billion for fiscal '22 or growth of 37% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $457 million to $467 million in Q1 or growth of 34% to 37% year-over-year, and $2.26 billion to $2.28 billion for fiscal '22 or growth of 31% to 32% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q1 and fiscal '22. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 12% to 14% for Q1, and 3% to 15% for fiscal '22. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, including undrawn revolver fees related to our credit facility. For fiscal '22, we expect a tax provision of approximately $8 million to $10 million. We expect fully diluted weighted shares -- average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million, for both Q1 and fiscal '22. In summary, we would like to thank the DocuSign team, our customers and our partners for their tremendous efforts during this unprecedented year. We are excited for this year as we continue to deliver on the large opportunity ahead. We will continue to focus on driving long-term durable growth at scale as we help customers thrive in the anywhere economy. Thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in a few weeks at Momentum at our Analyst Day. And now, we will open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just curious terms of what you're seeing on the new customers that are coming on board to this platform, what ones are taking some of the advanced features for the SpringCM capabilities versus just plain eSignature?\nDan Springer: Is that specifically you're thinking about vertical, geography? What dimensions would be most useful for you?\nSterling Auty: No, across the board. So, what kind of penetration? So, what's the take rate for kind of the additional contract management and just kind of contract cloud in the new customers coming on?\nDan Springer: So, it's still a relatively small piece. If you think about what's happened really throughout the year, as we talked about all year, with COVID, we saw a dramatic move with a lot of acceleration in digital transformation to those sort of entry type applications and signature is just a fantastic way for people not to get -- not only an incredibly high ROI but to quickly get that transformation they need in their business and be able to be effectively in the anywhere economy. So, I think that has not changed. And if you look at things like CLM, where there is a longer purchase sort of cycle where people require a statement of work or professional services to implement, those definitely were slowed through this year, relative to where they were in the prior year. Our view, though, coming out of fiscal year 21, particularly coming out of Q4 here, is we're seeing that the build, the pipeline build again. And so, we're quite optimistic that we're going to see sort of that reacceleration that we saw a little over a year ago with CLM in particular. And then -- and the sense we're seeing that is, it's going to be not so much in our smallest or largest customers, but it's going to go more quickly in those mid-market or commercial businesses where it tends to be a little bit more fast-moving than the largest enterprises, but having a little bit more scale and need for a full CLM-like solution than our SMB [solution] [ph]. So, that's where we see that developing.\nSterling Auty: Great. And then, one just quick follow-up. You mentioned and talked about the remote notary. What's the timing on when we might see that in the market, and where are some of the first use cases that you think you'll see the adoption?\nDan Springer: Yes. So, what we see right now is that we've gone through the beta, which we've been really pleased with, and we're moving this month to get a sort of a limited release. We're going to be focused on financial services companies, the use case. And remember, the first piece we're coming out was this first-party notary. So, that's -- which we think is the significantly larger part of the total market. First party is when companies have their own effective notary. So, they're actually notarizing documents with their and usually consumers with an in-house or internal notary. And then, third party, where people are using sort of a notary is coming to bring two people together that doesn't work for either of them, which is a smaller part, we'll have that by the end of the year out into release.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much, guys. And congratulations on a very strong end to the year. Maybe the first one from my end. Cynthia, you mentioned the guidance for fiscal '22. When you talk about the methodology that you approach to setting guidance for the year, is there anything different on how you approached it versus perhaps how you guys initially looked at fiscal '21? And what are some of the puts and takes that you considered in setting your guidance, mainly for billings because that's the metric that investors will care most about? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. Yes. I mean, our guidance philosophy has been super consistent since the time we went public. We guide to what we can see. And it's largely data-driven. So, we use everything from pipeline and demand trends to close rates to looking at kind of the net new that we added during the year, and looking at kind of the upsell trends and expansion trends within there. So, it's quite data-driven, and we guide to what we can see. And it's been very consistent from that perspective.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. So, as far as just considering how the business could trend into fiscal '22, as we're lapping the pandemic, sounds like you applied the same type of lens as any other year as far as the conservatism that's baked into those estimates or anything along those lines?\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. Yes. I think -- I mean, we think the guide is reasonable. And just given how quickly the Company has grown at scale, right, our business today is 50% bigger than it was a year ago. Earlier in our fiscal year, we had crossed the $1 billion in revenue mark, and now, we're quickly coming up on $1.5 billion going to $2 billion. And so, when you think about growth at scale, we are looking at that closely because we're just growing solidly off a much bigger base. And so, we're watching that closely and the different metrics that we're seeing. I think, the pandemic certainly adds an additional layer of complexity, just given the number of customers we've had, the demand and acceleration of demand we've been seeing. And that's all reflected in the guide for the year.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. And then, a very quick follow-up for Dan. The international growth numbers, I mean, they continue to really show an outstanding momentum. And if I recall correctly, I think it's actually accelerating slightly off the Q3 pace. What's really driving the international adoption? What's out there? What are you seeing out there that may be a little bit different than what you're seeing in the U.S.? That's it from me. Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yes. I mean, I think, the answer is, it's very broad-based. One of the things that was really interesting for us finishing up the year, and you don't get to say this very often, but same thing happened in Q3, happened in Q4, every single geography that we're in outside of the U.S. and for that matter, the U.S., exceeded its plan. And it's just in my experience, that's something that's pretty special and pretty rare to happen. And so, we don't think there's a particular type of geography, either the common law or civil law or sort of EMEA versus Asia Pac. We're just seeing it across the board. And Stan, my view is what's happening here, it's actually quite interesting. If you think about a year ago, we shared this result where we sort of laid the growth of DocuSign in the U.S. over its size when it was same size where international business was and looked at that growth, and they're actually quite close. And so, I think what's happening here is that the U.S. business, when it was much smaller, grew at a higher rate. And so, now, we're seeing this happen in our international business. So, it's not really surprising to us, and it's nothing that's sort of changing in the marketplace. I think we're just realizing it's a very large TAM opportunity outside of the U.S., and we're starting to really hit that growth curve in the way we'd like to be hitting it, and we're optimistic we're going to continue to see that through the year ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. I have two, if I can. One for each of you. Dan, I mean, I think, in the county that I live in, across the bay from you, I think we're up to 26% or 27% of the people haven't gotten their first shot. So, I'm just wondering if you -- as February and March have started here, is there any change in the demand environment, based on more of a return to normalcy.\nDan Springer: We haven't seen anything. I don't know whether we would be a leading or a lagging indicator, Pat. But, we haven't seen anything in our business that suggests that that will change. Now, if you recall, we said this about starting about three quarters ago that our forecast on this is that the people that have come with new customers or new use cases to DocuSign that are COVID-19 centric, they're not going back. People aren't going back to paper, not going back to manual process. So, the real question, I think, is interesting in your question is, will that rate of new people coming to us change with -- as we start to move into some sort of return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d. We haven't seen any change yet, and maybe that the change isn't enough, and there's not enough new activity to have driven the change in the demand environment. But, at this point, yes, we haven't seen a change yet.\nPat Walravens: All right. Perfect. And then, I'm not sure which of you wants to address this. But, I think it's super interesting as I'm looking back at my model and in April of 2019, so Q1 of fiscal '20, net dollar retention was 112%, and it's gone up seven quarters in a row. What is driving that? I mean, that's not all the pandemic, right? Why has it gone up seven quarters in a row?\nDan Springer: We're looking at each other. I'll start and let Cynthia finish with the good stuff. But, I think, the real answer is we made a significant investment in customer success is really the short off the bat. We've always been a customer success company. And starting about a year before that, so about three years ago, I think we realized we could do more. And it's not just our customer success organization and the CSMs that I think are so powerful, although they are fantastic and they're a huge part of it. But I think culturally, we really have just sort of forced all of our employees to say we need to be a customer success company, and it's great because it's wonderful for the SaaS economics, as you articulated. But two, it's great because it makes employees proud to work here. It makes them proud to be at a company that says, of course, we're going to make money. We're a business, but we want to be part of something bigger than that, and we want to be proud about that. And so, I really think that investment is now yielding those results.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I would just add, if you have to remember that our customers start out small and then they grow over time. And so, when you think about the number of customers that we've added over the past couple of years and this year, in particular, they start out small, they expand as they use the product. And as Dan said, we've invested a lot in customer success to help them become successful on the platform. And so, that's certainly driving that number as the denominator gets bigger, the numerator is also getting bigger as customers use the products more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Dan and Cynthia, just on the 4Q billings performance, it came pretty close to the pin relative to the prior quarters where DocuSign had put up pretty strong double-digit beats against the high end. I'm just wondering if anything felt a little different in the fourth quarter, maybe there was some timing or other factors? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, we talked about this a little bit on the Q3 call. So, Q3 was exceptionally strong, based on timing of deals and some early renewals that came in, in Q3. And so, Q4 was a strong growth as well at 46%, albeit it wasn't as strong as the Q3 growth. So, there was nothing unusual in the quarter. I would just remind you that on billings, they can fluctuate more, just given the nature of that metric and the timing of deals. And so, we continue to encourage folks to look at that four-quarter average that smooths out the changes quarter-to-quarter. And if you take that lens and apply it to Q4, it was really right in line with the last couple of quarters in that trailing average.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Cynthia. And then, maybe a follow-up for you. I know, typically, when you start the fiscal year, you give your operating margin guidance, but maybe not the cash flow guidance. But, as you pointed out, the adjusted free cash flow margins in fiscal '21 were 20% relative to your operating margins of 12%. Should, as we model free cash in fiscal '22, use something similar to that correlation, or might there be something unusual in fiscal 22, such that it will look a little bit different?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, we don't guide to cash flow. But, I think, when you look at kind of the Q4 and for the year, the cash flow, and we gave all those numbers in the release, right, the convertible notes that we took down in Q4. On an adjusted basis, the cash flow was actually quite compelling. Even without the adjustment, we're showing just a lot of leverage in the model, similar to the operating margin, right? Now, we'll continue to invest in growth. So, I wouldn't anticipate anything in fiscal '22 out of the ordinary. My sense is, we'll continue to demonstrate that leverage. But, if we can invest for growth, we will. And that's one of the reasons we did the financing in January was really to give us that operating flexibility.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey everyone. This is actually Jake on for Bhavan. Congrats on a great quarter. So, just touching again on the capital allocation strategy in this year. How can we be thinking about that in terms of similar tuck-in acquisitions to what we've seen in the past? And then, just as a follow-up, would love to hear about how you're thinking about the competitive landscape, given the recent acquisitions from Box and Dropbox in the space?\nDan Springer: Yes, absolutely. I don't think we see any dramatic change to our thinking on M&A strategy. I think, we love to build stuff ourselves. We have a fantastic product development team here. And the vast, vast majority of all the product that we have, the stuff that we've built internally. But from time to time, and Seal would be a good example of this from last year. We look out and we see, wow, some folks are really ahead of where we are, not just on some product development, in this case, in artificial intelligence and advanced analytics, but also, they just have some domain expertise. It would take us a long time to build that. So, we've seen some really nice tuck-in acquisitions that are relatively small compared to our revenue or compared to our market valuation. But, we think meaningful in accelerating that Agreement Cloud strategy that we have. I think, we're probably thinking about things the same way. It's possible we could go a year not do any deals, but we didn't see anything that we needed, and we could also do, as we did last year, a couple of deals or more. It's fantastic to have Cynthia in the seat of CFO now with all of her banking experience prior to becoming a CFO that I suppose gives us more perspective on different things we might look at in that way. But just at the highest level, I think it's sort of the same that we did last year is probably what you should expect going forward, because we're not doing anything fundamentally differently. I would say that we are looking at doing a few more investments. And again, Seal is a wonderful example of a company we invested in and got closer to them. So, we felt we were really setting ourselves up for a highly successful integration and acquisition there. And I think, you may see us do more of that in the future, increase the number of small investments we're making in companies we see in the broadly defined Agreement Cloud space, and then potentially have those as acquisition opportunities. The second part of your question around the competitive landscape, we don't think there's been any change. We always say very aggressively, when we think about competition, we fundamentally think about paper. When we think about paper and manual processes, we are so early into this game in terms of where the TAM is. The vast, vast majority of all of our growth is coming from new field expansion. From time to time, people want to upgrade, particularly in signature, we'll see that or someone will want to move from a less advanced sort of smaller feature set provider. But again, the bulk of us is building this new market. So, I don't think that's changing. We always, of course, take careful looks when someone buys, someone that's in one of our spaces. Box is a partner of ours, and we continue to want to partner with them. We have a very open model. And this won't change our approach to that relationship at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Dan, you obviously have a huge cohort of new customers coming up for renewal over the next couple of quarters. What's the conversation like the year after you signed someone up? Meaning, is that really a of leverage where conversation might go from a departmental conversation to enterprise-wide conversation, or is that the time that you start being able to sort of introduce some newer functionality of products? I'm just kind of curious about how you and the sales organization talk about sort of the next step with a lot of these customers that came on this year, because it would seem to be an opportunity to sort of go beyond maybe the pandemic-related sort of decisions they had to make, meaning these could be really nice expansion deals for you all over the next two to three quarters.\nDan Springer: Yes. I think, that's exactly how we look at it. I'd tell you, the answer to your question is a high level, of course, it depends, right? There's quite a range. We absolutely have some customers before they make it to a year realize they're exceeding the capacity that they purchase from us. And we do early renewals even before the year. That's a small percentage of them. One year mark is a great opportunity to take stock with our customers and say, what's your sort of utilization of the capacity you have to date with signature. And again, the vast, vast majority of people start with us, with signature. And then, is there opportunities, as you said, to go to additional departments, sometimes it's phenomenon. It's just more use cases in the same department. They brought in some back office use cases in the HR department, but they have more that they could use, separate from going to finance or going to the front office. And then, of course, the thing that we're kind of really excited about with the Agreement Cloud is starting to have those successful customers start the conversation about the broader product portfolio. And so, I think, we'll have all of the above. I do believe we're going to see two phenomenon at a high level this year. One, a lot of people that kind of came to us last year and have been successful in adopting, they're also going to need to take a little bit of a breather because they've been going so fast in this remote setting, now they're coming back on board, and they've sort of put off a lot of other projects. So, we have heard CIOs say that they've got a backlog now of things they need to get done because the pandemic made it very difficult for them to get certain projects done. And at the same time, I think we're going to see a lot of people who are saying, wow, I'm really glad I got started with this digital transformation, and I want more of it. And so, they're going to want to accelerate even the expectations they may have had for that pace to change. So, when you put all that mix together, it's fairly complex. But, it leaves us feeling we're going to have a considerable cross and upsell opportunity this year. And those incremental customers, significant customer, new adds that Cynthia talked about earlier from last year, over the course of this year, particularly the second half of this year, when a lot of those renewals come up, should be a great cross-sell opportunity.\nKirk Materne: And if I could sneak just a really quick second one in. What's sort of your thought process on your partner relationships with some of the bigger GSIs, now that we're hopefully getting back to a more sort of normalized world? Is this a year where you think you can make sort of a bigger step forward in having those partners build bigger practices on you, especially around sort of the broader Agreement Cloud, or is that maybe even a counter \u201822 event? Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yes. So, I'll be as candid as I can. So, we're enthusiastic, but we're also very cognizant of the fact that those are relationships to work at scale to take time to develop. Historically, as we've shared, the really large GSIs sort of looked at us and said, we aspire to someday be able to do more with DocuSign because we love the brand, we love the products, but there wasn't as much of an economic opportunity, particularly with signature only. And quite frankly, they came back and said, your software is too easy to use. It doesn't create enough economic opportunity for us. And we totally got it. And now, they're starting to look, as you said, the broader Agreement Cloud, and there's a lot of enthusiasm building there. But, if you said this year and we think about our sort of SI strategy, this year, fiscal year \u201822, I believe the bulk of the success we will get will be with the regional SIs this year but really starting to make traction with the GSIs. And probably next year is the year where I would be disappointed if we weren't really hitting the ground running with the GSIs, because they all want to be DocuSign partners. We just got to get that model right, so it can be significant enough for them for their business model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: I guess, I want to drill down a little bit more on the international front. And since I can't really ask a question to Mike Sheridan, [Technical Difficulty] ask a question about. Just in terms of -- any changes relative to go-to-market sales process? And as you look at a lot of the major geographies out there, where are they in terms of the maturity or relative to the U.S. and what you're seeing? Are there different competitors that you run into regional? Just regard [Technical Difficulty] where the overall opportunity is [Technical Difficulty]\nDan Springer: Yes. Well, Rob, let me -- I'll try to channel Mike for you best I can because I guess I should use a much deeper voice if I'm going to channel Mike. But the construct, I would say, is the work that we talked about the last couple of quarters was really the success that we needed in Europe was around coordination. We've grown very quickly. And we realized we wanted to put additional leadership to support the international growth because we weren't coordinated as well as we could across our own organization, so that our marketing team working with our sales teams, our sales teams working with our success and professional services teams, and we had real opportunity. And we've been pleased with that result. And we want to continue to have that focus and investment. There wasn't anything I'd say fundamentally broken with the business, but we did have some opportunity for better coordination. And I think that has helped us. But, I think in the end, as you heard us talk about earlier, at the beginning of the call, what's happened in international is it's coming into its own, and it's sitting at scale, just like we had the scale growth in our domestic business several years before. From a standpoint of the types of investments, I do think we will continually look at additional markets where we could have a bigger presence in those markets. Because of our web and mobile business, we sell well over 100 countries. But, we have these eight focus countries that we've put most of our effort against. And we continue to think that's the right strategy because there's just a lot more growth in those markets. But, over the course of this year, I would not be surprised to see us come forward and say another country or even two that we're going to sort of add to that list of the focus eight and start to go deeper. And then the last piece, I'd say, we are really investing aggressively in our digital strategy, which, of course, is global in nature. And I think it can be a significant part of growing our international business because that reach can get up to close to 200 countries. And we want to be leveraging that investment aggressively as part of international.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, Dan and Cynthia. Thanks so much for taking my questions. It's nice to see the business momentum continuing. I got two questions. First, just following up on the conversation on international. You really ramped up international hiring. Where are you ramping up your headcount the most? Is it on sales coverage? Is it on leadership product side or other areas? And maybe alongside that, Dan, you talked about your kind of eight focused countries. As I look at the slide you laid out in your slide deck, on international traction, it seems like there's a huge opportunity in Asia, and really, Japan is the only country that you had a good amount of success there. But, it seems like there's a really big opportunity. What needs to happen to get real success in that Asia, ex-Japan region? And any lessons that you could take from the, I think, surprising, at least to me, success you've had in Brazil, into those territories? And then, I got a follow-up.\nDan Springer: Sure. Yes. In terms of the investment by category, it's sales and customer success. I mean, the core field is what we have built. And we're not -- we have product people in Europe and Paris, but the bulk of what we're building is the core field and then the support organizations, like marketing, like finance, like legal that are going to really support those teams in their growth. But, the core of it is sales and customer success. And then in terms of your question specifically about Asia and Asia Pacific, so I think we -- two things. One, we have -- historically thinking of the Asia Pacific market as all other and then Japan. We're actually starting to look at it now as a JPAC mindset. And we're increasingly looking at bringing leadership in to cover across those two businesses. A lot of software companies have very distinct Japanese businesses, and there's a lot of good reasons for that, the nature of how that economy works. But we think we have opportunity to be more successful broadly in Southeast Asia, if we leverage the strength we have in Japan and the strength we have had traditionally in the ANZ market. So, that's probably the best answer for what we're trying to do to address that. We do have a small presence in Singapore, which we think can be an important launching pad for other markets, in Southeast Asia. But at this point, we don't have plans to open additional offices in Asia. We really want to try to leverage what we've got in Sydney and Melbourne, Tokyo and Singapore.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Got it. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask on the CLM side as you continue to gain traction there, and get more and more customer land. Do you find yourselves getting into more competitive situations against some of the pure-play CLMs, like Icertis or even SAP, Ariba, or how would you characterize what you're seeing as you get more traction there? Thanks.\nDan Springer: Well, I think for us, the competitive situation is -- a question earlier about competition is quite different in eSignature than it is in anything else, right? We have such a dramatic market share lead and, quite frankly, product capability lead in eSignature that it's -- there's just the competition I said is paper. It's not that there aren't other strong companies that are in the market, but just by the sheer size advantage that we have. And you heard us talk about this before. We spend more money on R&D than we think those folks have in revenue. So, from that standpoint, it's a very different dynamic, and we are one of the leaders in CLM, but there are other credible companies in the space. So, we do see a different competitive dynamic. You mentioned SAP and Ariba. Interestingly, SAP is much more of a partner really than a competitor. And increasingly, we're actually investing significantly in our integrations into Ariba to ensure that our CLM products will be industry-leading on the buy side as well as they are on the sell side today. But in general, I think your point is spot on. And it is a different competitive dynamic. And we're one of the leaders, but not the dramatic leader that we are in signature.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Going back to the retention number, reference that continues to pick up, how should we think about the progression from here? Are those 120-plus-percent level something you feel could sustain given the seed links you've laid with eSignature this year and just expansion opportunities with the Agreement Cloud you've laid out, and it sounds like are starting to gain some momentum, or is there some counter balance we should also be mindful of in penciling those numbers out going forward?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, on that, I think, the new codes are really seeding our opportunity in upsells and expansion when we think just kind of about the market opportunity and where that number could go. However, given the scale that we're at and the rate that we've been growing, we're watching that number quite closely. So, our historic range for dollar net retention has been kind of in the 112% to 119% range, in the last the last bunch of quarters, we've been above that range. And so, I think the way to think about that is we likely would continue at the high end of the historical range or at least at the high end of the historical range. And we'll continue to monitor that metric quite closely. But, we're feeling good, one, about the 123% that we posted for Q4, but then also just the amount of net new customers that we've added, and how they've been expanding over the course of the last year.\nMichael Turrin: That's helpful. Just maybe a quick follow-on Cynthia on hiring. You had a big step-up in headcount midyear. At least from a sequential perspective, it looks like the pace of adds is starting to moderate. Can you just expand on how you're thinking about capacity from here? I think, there's continued commentary around staying in growth investment mode. But, have you laid some of the initial seeds with margin expansion already in the guide? It looks like maybe that's the case, but anything you can add is helpful.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, for sure. And that's exactly how we're thinking about it. We are investing for growth. And if you think about the last four quarters, in the first half of last year, our customer demand outstripped the capacity in the field, right? And so, as we moved through the year, we then accelerated hiring to really meet that customer demand and to set us up to continue to grow off a higher base coming into the year. And so, we'll continue to make investments across the go-to-market in sales and success, as Dan had mentioned, but then also in R&D and continuing to innovate around the product portfolio, particularly across the Agreement Cloud. And so, we'll continue to make those investments. You will see us continue to move towards our operating margin targets. But, just given how nascent the opportunity is, how big the opportunity is and our market position, we'll continue to invest aggressively for growth.\nDan Springer: And one other piece, I wouldn't look at it as a reduction in the capacity building in the second half. If you factor in the acquisitions that we did in the middle of the year, so if you look at the number of employees that we brought on with the Seal and the Liveoak Technologies, that sort of inflated a little bit in the middle of the year. So, if you smooth that out, I think you hear what Cynthia is saying is very consistent that we are continuing to invest in growth first. The performance of the business is such that we threw more to the bottom line than we expected. It's not a problem, but it's no way an indication that we're moving back from our focus on growth first.\nMichael Turrin: Yes, it's a good problem to have. Thanks. Congrats on the impressive year you just closed.\nDan Springer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citigroup.\nTyler Radke: I wanted to ask you just how you're thinking about maybe some of the newer verticals particularly around federal or some other verticals that maybe you didn't see as much success in, in FY21. How are you thinking about those in terms of being a driver here this year?\nDan Springer: Yes. So, we think about our business in verticals, for sure. And then, we have our geo business, right, which is quite substantial. But, in the verticals, the overall government vertical was incredibly strong for us in fiscal year '21, but it was very strong at state and local. And it wasn't as strong in federal. And I don't know that I have -- I mean, we could sort of hypothesize on what a pandemic does for certain types of governments or others. But, I think that there were so many kind of like health and human services aspects in the state and local, where they deliver those types of services to their populations that that really needed to happen in a quick way. And I think that federal agencies just had less of that and less of that urgency. So, from that standpoint, as we look forward to this year and we think about federal, I think we think it\u2019s a lot of opportunity, and there's a lot of almost pent-up sort of demand. Now, we run by the federal government. It's fantastic, but their pace of change there is sometimes not rapid. So, we wouldn't be surprised if some of those things take longer than we think, but we do see a pipe building of significant opportunities to add that to the good success we had in state and local this last year.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Well said. Thank you. And just a follow-up. Maybe just if you could kind of share with us what you're thinking about in terms of return to, obviously, not back to full normal pre-COVID spending levels, but just kind of what you're modeling in, in terms of high-level assumptions there.\nDan Springer: Are you talking about our spending, or are you talking about customer spending?\nTyler Radke: Yes, just spending on either travel, entertainment, office spending, just kind of curious how you're thinking about that through the back half of the year.\nDan Springer: Yes. Well, so, we've sort of told our employees to give you some indication of that that they would not be required to return to DocuSign offices until October 4th. Now, we previously said June and had pushed out, it could push out again, obviously. But, that's our perspective that we wouldn't be back in any significant way before then. And Cynthia, do you want to talk a little bit how we've modeled the expenses from that standpoint and how that might change to try to give some perspective? I look at the bottom line and say, we've talked about continued increase in our profitability and our operating income, but not at the torrid rate that it improved in fiscal year '21 because we do want to focus on growth investing.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, of course, of course. And so, I think towards the second half of the year, we're starting to bake in kind of more a return to office in our own expense line. But, I would say it's moderated, right, because it will kind of ramp in there slowly. I would say last year, that probably wasn't the biggest impact on our margin. It was really the outperformance and the customer demand. And so, we invested in other places when kind of some of the travel went away, including in employees and some employee benefit types of program. So, in a nutshell, we're baking it in towards the second half of the year, but it's kind of a slow ramp-up, but it's included in the guide.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, but we are out of time for questions. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dan Springer for closing remarks.\nDan Springer: Thank you so much, and thank you all for joining us. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we really hope you'll all be able to join us for our inaugural Analyst Day, and we'll look forward to seeing you there. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. In a monumental year, DocuSign helped many customers overcome challenges and transform their businesses to adapt to the new and changing environment. The strong demand for digital workflow accelerated our continued growth at scale and heightened our focus on execution and operations to meet our customers' needs. We capped off an exceptional year for DocuSign with strong results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, driven by robust new customer growth and expansions, primarily for our core eSignature offerings. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 57% year-over-year to $431 million, and subscription revenue grew 59% year-over-year to $410 million. For the full year, total revenue reached $1.45 billion, an increase of 49% over last year, and subscription revenue hit $1.38 billion, an increase of 50%. Our international revenue increased an impressive 83% year-over-year to $89 million in the fourth quarter, ticking up 21% of total revenue. For the full year, international revenue grew over 67% to $287 million, reflecting accelerated expansion across geographies. For the first time, we reached over $0.5 billion in quarterly billings as Q4 rose 46% year-over-year to $535 million. This resulted in a 56% trailing four-quarter average, consistent with last quarter's average. For the full year, billings increased $1.7 billion. Q4 customer additions continued at a robust pace as we added over 70,000 new customers. This brings our total installed base to nearly 892,000 customers worldwide, an increase of 51% over last year and more than double the number of new additions compared with fiscal '20. To give you a sense of the magnitude of this achievement, we added nearly the same number of customers this past year as we had in total at the time we went public, 15 years after the Company was founded. As part of this, we added 11,000 new direct customers in Q4 for a total of over 50,000 for the year. After more than doubling the number we added in fiscal '20, we ended the year with nearly 125,000 direct customers. For the third quarter in a row, we exceeded our historic dollar net retention range, hitting our highest level yet at 123% for Q4. Switching gears. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 80% compared with 79% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was 79%, consistent with fiscal '20. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. For the full year, subscription gross margin was 84%, consistent with fiscal '20. We saw significant improvement in our operating leverage as non-GAAP operating margin reached a record high of 17% or $75 million compared to 8% or $21 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, operating margin was 12%, a more than 7.5 percentage-point improvement over fiscal '20. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $77 million compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, net income was $182 million up from $59 million in fiscal '20. We ended the quarter with 5,630 employees, an increase of 44% over last year. In Q4, we took steps to put in place a more strategic and efficient capital structure. We issued $690 million in new 2024 convertible senior notes and paid down the majority of our existing 2023 convertible notes. We also put in place a new revolving credit facility, allowing us to borrow up to $500 million with additional capacity up to $750 million in total. While we are generating sufficient cash from our operations to fund our working capital needs, we believe this additional financial capacity, along with the attractive terms, will provide greater flexibility for our growth agenda. We exited fiscal '21 with $867 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Operating cash flow in fourth quarter was $62 million or 14% margin. This compares with $46 million or 17% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow was $44 million or 10% margin in the quarter compared to $16 million or 6% in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow more than doubled to $297 million or 20% compared to $116 million or 12% a year ago. And free cash flow grew to $215 million or 15% compared to $44 million or 4% in fiscal '20. These amounts include $75 million related to accounting for the extinguishment of the 2023 convertible notes. Excluding this, Q4 operating cash flow would have been $137 million or 32% margin, and free cash flow would have been $119 million or 28% margin. For the full year, operating cash flow would have been $372 million or 26% margin, and free cash flow would have been $290 million or 20% margin. This underscores the attractiveness of our model and the leverage we are seeing across the business. Now, on to our guidance. Coming into this fiscal year, we expect to see continued secular tailwinds in support of the anywhere economy. We are confident in our long-term trajectory and the untapped opportunity ahead. That being said, while our subscription-based model gives us a certain level of visibility, the impact of the pandemic adds an extra layer of complexity, which we are monitoring closely. With this backdrop, our approach to guidance continues to be to guide to what we know and can see in the current environment. As we begin the new fiscal year, we are guiding to non-GAAP operating margin going forward rather than individual operating expense lines to better align with how we are growing and scaling the business. For the first quarter in fiscal '22, we anticipate total revenue of $432 million to $436 million in Q1 or growth of 45% to 47% year-over-year, and $1.963 billion to $1.973 billion for fiscal '22 or growth of 35% to 36% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $415 million to $419 million in Q1 or growth of 48% to 49% year-over-year, and $1.886 billion to $1.896 billion for fiscal '22 or growth of 37% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $457 million to $467 million in Q1 or growth of 34% to 37% year-over-year, and $2.26 billion to $2.28 billion for fiscal '22 or growth of 31% to 32% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q1 and fiscal '22. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 12% to 14% for Q1, and 3% to 15% for fiscal '22. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, including undrawn revolver fees related to our credit facility. For fiscal '22, we expect a tax provision of approximately $8 million to $10 million. We expect fully diluted weighted shares -- average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million, for both Q1 and fiscal '22. In summary, we would like to thank the DocuSign team, our customers and our partners for their tremendous efforts during this unprecedented year. We are excited for this year as we continue to deliver on the large opportunity ahead. We will continue to focus on driving long-term durable growth at scale as we help customers thrive in the anywhere economy. Thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in a few weeks at Momentum at our Analyst Day. And now, we will open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Sure. Yes. I mean, our guidance philosophy has been super consistent since the time we went public. We guide to what we can see. And it's largely data-driven. So, we use everything from pipeline and demand trends to close rates to looking at kind of the net new that we added during the year, and looking at kind of the upsell trends and expansion trends within there. So, it's quite data-driven, and we guide to what we can see. And it's been very consistent from that perspective. Sure. Yes. I think -- I mean, we think the guide is reasonable. And just given how quickly the Company has grown at scale, right, our business today is 50% bigger than it was a year ago. Earlier in our fiscal year, we had crossed the $1 billion in revenue mark, and now, we're quickly coming up on $1.5 billion going to $2 billion. And so, when you think about growth at scale, we are looking at that closely because we're just growing solidly off a much bigger base. And so, we're watching that closely and the different metrics that we're seeing. I think, the pandemic certainly adds an additional layer of complexity, just given the number of customers we've had, the demand and acceleration of demand we've been seeing. And that's all reflected in the guide for the year. Yes. I would just add, if you have to remember that our customers start out small and then they grow over time. And so, when you think about the number of customers that we've added over the past couple of years and this year, in particular, they start out small, they expand as they use the product. And as Dan said, we've invested a lot in customer success to help them become successful on the platform. And so, that's certainly driving that number as the denominator gets bigger, the numerator is also getting bigger as customers use the products more. Yes. So, we talked about this a little bit on the Q3 call. So, Q3 was exceptionally strong, based on timing of deals and some early renewals that came in, in Q3. And so, Q4 was a strong growth as well at 46%, albeit it wasn't as strong as the Q3 growth. So, there was nothing unusual in the quarter. I would just remind you that on billings, they can fluctuate more, just given the nature of that metric and the timing of deals. And so, we continue to encourage folks to look at that four-quarter average that smooths out the changes quarter-to-quarter. And if you take that lens and apply it to Q4, it was really right in line with the last couple of quarters in that trailing average. Yes. So, we don't guide to cash flow. But, I think, when you look at kind of the Q4 and for the year, the cash flow, and we gave all those numbers in the release, right, the convertible notes that we took down in Q4. On an adjusted basis, the cash flow was actually quite compelling. Even without the adjustment, we're showing just a lot of leverage in the model, similar to the operating margin, right? Now, we'll continue to invest in growth. So, I wouldn't anticipate anything in fiscal '22 out of the ordinary. My sense is, we'll continue to demonstrate that leverage. But, if we can invest for growth, we will. And that's one of the reasons we did the financing in January was really to give us that operating flexibility. Yes. So, on that, I think, the new codes are really seeding our opportunity in upsells and expansion when we think just kind of about the market opportunity and where that number could go. However, given the scale that we're at and the rate that we've been growing, we're watching that number quite closely. So, our historic range for dollar net retention has been kind of in the 112% to 119% range, in the last the last bunch of quarters, we've been above that range. And so, I think the way to think about that is we likely would continue at the high end of the historical range or at least at the high end of the historical range. And we'll continue to monitor that metric quite closely. But, we're feeling good, one, about the 123% that we posted for Q4, but then also just the amount of net new customers that we've added, and how they've been expanding over the course of the last year. Yes, for sure. And that's exactly how we're thinking about it. We are investing for growth. And if you think about the last four quarters, in the first half of last year, our customer demand outstripped the capacity in the field, right? And so, as we moved through the year, we then accelerated hiring to really meet that customer demand and to set us up to continue to grow off a higher base coming into the year. And so, we'll continue to make investments across the go-to-market in sales and success, as Dan had mentioned, but then also in R&D and continuing to innovate around the product portfolio, particularly across the Agreement Cloud. And so, we'll continue to make those investments. You will see us continue to move towards our operating margin targets. But, just given how nascent the opportunity is, how big the opportunity is and our market position, we'll continue to invest aggressively for growth. Yes, of course, of course. And so, I think towards the second half of the year, we're starting to bake in kind of more a return to office in our own expense line. But, I would say it's moderated, right, because it will kind of ramp in there slowly. I would say last year, that probably wasn't the biggest impact on our margin. It was really the outperformance and the customer demand. And so, we invested in other places when kind of some of the travel went away, including in employees and some employee benefit types of program. So, in a nutshell, we're baking it in towards the second half of the year, but it's kind of a slow ramp-up, but it's included in the guide."

Before we get to our results, I want to acknowledge that it's been almost a year to the day since we shifted our business operations and day-to-day lives in response to the pandemic. Over that time, COVID-19 has created huge challenges and disruptions for almost everyone, everywhere. Ones we're all still dealing with today. But amid those challenges, people found ways to keep life and work moving forward. As a team, DocuSign was honored to play a role supporting people all over the world as they responded to the pandemic. We gained new customers, we expanded our relationship with others, and we saw a surge in adoption of our products as accelerating a trend already underway, the digital transformation of agreements. This transformation not only allows agreements to be prepared, signed, act on and manage from anywhere, it also allows greater speed and efficiency than manual paper-based processes. As a result, we don't believe our new or expanded customers will be going back to paper, even after the pandemic recedes. We also don't believe life will go back to the way it was before. Of course, many in-person activities will be welcome back. But, when people found better ways during the pandemic, we believe those will continue and flourish, whether it's total or partial work from home, virtual visits to medical professionals or getting a document notarized remotely. Ultimately, over the coming years, we think the trend will continue towards the option of doing anything from anywhere. We call the products and services supporting this trend, the \u2018anywhere economy'. We believe we're a key pillar, and it's only just beginning. You'll hear more from us about this in the coming weeks. With that, we have a lot to share around Q4 and our full fiscal year. So, let's cover that in three parts: Our strong Q4 and record fiscal '21 results; how we think about our continued evolution into the Agreement Cloud company, and how the Agreement Cloud delivers value to our customers and partners. First, our results. Q4 was another strong quarter for us, contributing to a milestone year for DocuSign overall. We saw revenue growth of 57% and billings growth of 46% year-over-year. We welcomed more than 70,000 new customers, bringing the total to nearly 892,000 customers worldwide. And we saw our strongest expansion and upsell rates yet, driving our dollar net retention to a record 123%. For the year, we exited fiscal '21 nearly 50% bigger than we were in fiscal '20 with almost $1.5 billion in revenue. And our customer addition rate was more than double that of fiscal '20, edging us ever closer to the 1 million customer mark. By any measure, that's an astounding year. It's a testament to how people around the world are embracing digital technologies to transform the way they work and live. It's a reflection of the incredible opportunity that's still in its very early stages. And, it's all made possible by the dedication of the 5,600-person strong DocuSign team, who've gone above and beyond to help our customers this entire year. Of course, this is a journey, not a destination. So, as we think about the future and our continued evolution into the Agreement Cloud company, we're increasingly going to do so in the context of three primary goals. First, we want DocuSign to be the best way to agree to anything anywhere. We've recently made great additions to our leading eSignature product with identity proofing, click wrap, electronic witnessing and soon, remote online notary transactions. We want to extend the benefits of digital signing to all kinds of agreements in all walks of life. We're seeing this transformation accelerate. For example, one of our financial services customers in the U.S. came on board early last year as part of its COVID-19 response strategy. And they deployed DocuSign across more than 20 use cases in the past six months alone. So far, DocuSign has powered almost 100,000 transactions for their HR, procurement, customer service and in-branch onboarding needs. These transactions took less than a minute to complete on average, delivering a rapid ROI. And DocuSign went from a crisis response solution last year to a business as usual solution today. For our second goal, we want to digitally transform the entire agreement process, pre and post-signature. Over fiscal '21, we continue to innovate in CLM and to integrate our acquisitions of Seal Software and Liveoak Technologies. And you can expect us to drive automation at every stage of the agreement cycle, all the way from preparing and signing to acting on and managing. As an example, one of our Latin American agricultural customers needed to improve the management, corporate governance and turnaround time for its key contracts, and they needed a solution deployed across more than 30 subsidiaries in a matter of weeks. With DocuSign's CLM and eSignature together, handling the entire agreement process, this customer reduced the time it took to complete contracts from 23 days to just one hour. Third, we want to continue ensuring that DocuSign is embedded in the applications where work and life happen. We already integrate with more than 350 apps, including recent integrations with Slack, Microsoft Teams and Workplace from Facebook. And we have an award-winning API for custom integration, including with our customers' proprietary applications and processes. One of our global manufacturing customers is a good example of how DocuSign can integrate and interoperate with multiple applications within an enterprise. The customer needed to ensure that NDAs and other critical documents could be generated accurately, reviewed quickly and sent and signed easily. Today, after working with the DocuSign team, company has integrated DocuSign's CLM and eSignature with its CRM, productivity software and cloud storage systems to create the exact desired workflow, with all the speed, accuracy and efficiency benefits that come with it. So, as I bring my remarks to a close, it's clear that fiscal '21 was extraordinary on almost every level. As thrilled as I am about DocuSign's performance, I'm even more pleased that we are able to help our customers during this uniquely challenging time. And to say that I'm excited for the pandemic to start subsiding is of course an understatement. I'm also excited about DocuSign being well-positioned for the anywhere economy I mentioned earlier. It points to the incredible opportunity that's out there for us, given that the journey to a modern-day agreement process is being prioritized, like never before. The market is still in its early stages, so we will continue to invest in growth as our first priority as we expand and scale our business. Lastly, before I hand the call over to Cynthia, a reminder that we'll be talking more deeply about all of this at our upcoming annual Momentum conference and our inaugural Analyst Day on March 24. I look forward to seeing you all there, virtually. For now, over to Cynthia. Is that specifically you're thinking about vertical, geography? What dimensions would be most useful for you? So, it's still a relatively small piece. If you think about what's happened really throughout the year, as we talked about all year, with COVID, we saw a dramatic move with a lot of acceleration in digital transformation to those sort of entry type applications and signature is just a fantastic way for people not to get -- not only an incredibly high ROI but to quickly get that transformation they need in their business and be able to be effectively in the anywhere economy. So, I think that has not changed. And if you look at things like CLM, where there is a longer purchase sort of cycle where people require a statement of work or professional services to implement, those definitely were slowed through this year, relative to where they were in the prior year. Our view, though, coming out of fiscal year 21, particularly coming out of Q4 here, is we're seeing that the build, the pipeline build again. And so, we're quite optimistic that we're going to see sort of that reacceleration that we saw a little over a year ago with CLM in particular. And then -- and the sense we're seeing that is, it's going to be not so much in our smallest or largest customers, but it's going to go more quickly in those mid-market or commercial businesses where it tends to be a little bit more fast-moving than the largest enterprises, but having a little bit more scale and need for a full CLM-like solution than our SMB [solution] [ph]. So, that's where we see that developing. Yes. So, what we see right now is that we've gone through the beta, which we've been really pleased with, and we're moving this month to get a sort of a limited release. We're going to be focused on financial services companies, the use case. And remember, the first piece we're coming out was this first-party notary. So, that's -- which we think is the significantly larger part of the total market. First party is when companies have their own effective notary. So, they're actually notarizing documents with their and usually consumers with an in-house or internal notary. And then, third party, where people are using sort of a notary is coming to bring two people together that doesn't work for either of them, which is a smaller part, we'll have that by the end of the year out into release. Yes. I mean, I think, the answer is, it's very broad-based. One of the things that was really interesting for us finishing up the year, and you don't get to say this very often, but same thing happened in Q3, happened in Q4, every single geography that we're in outside of the U.S. and for that matter, the U.S., exceeded its plan. And it's just in my experience, that's something that's pretty special and pretty rare to happen. And so, we don't think there's a particular type of geography, either the common law or civil law or sort of EMEA versus Asia Pac. We're just seeing it across the board. And Stan, my view is what's happening here, it's actually quite interesting. If you think about a year ago, we shared this result where we sort of laid the growth of DocuSign in the U.S. over its size when it was same size where international business was and looked at that growth, and they're actually quite close. And so, I think what's happening here is that the U.S. business, when it was much smaller, grew at a higher rate. And so, now, we're seeing this happen in our international business. So, it's not really surprising to us, and it's nothing that's sort of changing in the marketplace. I think we're just realizing it's a very large TAM opportunity outside of the U.S., and we're starting to really hit that growth curve in the way we'd like to be hitting it, and we're optimistic we're going to continue to see that through the year ahead. We haven't seen anything. I don't know whether we would be a leading or a lagging indicator, Pat. But, we haven't seen anything in our business that suggests that that will change. Now, if you recall, we said this about starting about three quarters ago that our forecast on this is that the people that have come with new customers or new use cases to DocuSign that are COVID-19 centric, they're not going back. People aren't going back to paper, not going back to manual process. So, the real question, I think, is interesting in your question is, will that rate of new people coming to us change with -- as we start to move into some sort of return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d. We haven't seen any change yet, and maybe that the change isn't enough, and there's not enough new activity to have driven the change in the demand environment. But, at this point, yes, we haven't seen a change yet. We're looking at each other. I'll start and let Cynthia finish with the good stuff. But, I think, the real answer is we made a significant investment in customer success is really the short off the bat. We've always been a customer success company. And starting about a year before that, so about three years ago, I think we realized we could do more. And it's not just our customer success organization and the CSMs that I think are so powerful, although they are fantastic and they're a huge part of it. But I think culturally, we really have just sort of forced all of our employees to say we need to be a customer success company, and it's great because it's wonderful for the SaaS economics, as you articulated. But two, it's great because it makes employees proud to work here. It makes them proud to be at a company that says, of course, we're going to make money. We're a business, but we want to be part of something bigger than that, and we want to be proud about that. And so, I really think that investment is now yielding those results. Yes, absolutely. I don't think we see any dramatic change to our thinking on M&A strategy. I think, we love to build stuff ourselves. We have a fantastic product development team here. And the vast, vast majority of all the product that we have, the stuff that we've built internally. But from time to time, and Seal would be a good example of this from last year. We look out and we see, wow, some folks are really ahead of where we are, not just on some product development, in this case, in artificial intelligence and advanced analytics, but also, they just have some domain expertise. It would take us a long time to build that. So, we've seen some really nice tuck-in acquisitions that are relatively small compared to our revenue or compared to our market valuation. But, we think meaningful in accelerating that Agreement Cloud strategy that we have. I think, we're probably thinking about things the same way. It's possible we could go a year not do any deals, but we didn't see anything that we needed, and we could also do, as we did last year, a couple of deals or more. It's fantastic to have Cynthia in the seat of CFO now with all of her banking experience prior to becoming a CFO that I suppose gives us more perspective on different things we might look at in that way. But just at the highest level, I think it's sort of the same that we did last year is probably what you should expect going forward, because we're not doing anything fundamentally differently. I would say that we are looking at doing a few more investments. And again, Seal is a wonderful example of a company we invested in and got closer to them. So, we felt we were really setting ourselves up for a highly successful integration and acquisition there. And I think, you may see us do more of that in the future, increase the number of small investments we're making in companies we see in the broadly defined Agreement Cloud space, and then potentially have those as acquisition opportunities. The second part of your question around the competitive landscape, we don't think there's been any change. We always say very aggressively, when we think about competition, we fundamentally think about paper. When we think about paper and manual processes, we are so early into this game in terms of where the TAM is. The vast, vast majority of all of our growth is coming from new field expansion. From time to time, people want to upgrade, particularly in signature, we'll see that or someone will want to move from a less advanced sort of smaller feature set provider. But again, the bulk of us is building this new market. So, I don't think that's changing. We always, of course, take careful looks when someone buys, someone that's in one of our spaces. Box is a partner of ours, and we continue to want to partner with them. We have a very open model. And this won't change our approach to that relationship at all. Yes. I think, that's exactly how we look at it. I'd tell you, the answer to your question is a high level, of course, it depends, right? There's quite a range. We absolutely have some customers before they make it to a year realize they're exceeding the capacity that they purchase from us. And we do early renewals even before the year. That's a small percentage of them. One year mark is a great opportunity to take stock with our customers and say, what's your sort of utilization of the capacity you have to date with signature. And again, the vast, vast majority of people start with us, with signature. And then, is there opportunities, as you said, to go to additional departments, sometimes it's phenomenon. It's just more use cases in the same department. They brought in some back office use cases in the HR department, but they have more that they could use, separate from going to finance or going to the front office. And then, of course, the thing that we're kind of really excited about with the Agreement Cloud is starting to have those successful customers start the conversation about the broader product portfolio. And so, I think, we'll have all of the above. I do believe we're going to see two phenomenon at a high level this year. One, a lot of people that kind of came to us last year and have been successful in adopting, they're also going to need to take a little bit of a breather because they've been going so fast in this remote setting, now they're coming back on board, and they've sort of put off a lot of other projects. So, we have heard CIOs say that they've got a backlog now of things they need to get done because the pandemic made it very difficult for them to get certain projects done. And at the same time, I think we're going to see a lot of people who are saying, wow, I'm really glad I got started with this digital transformation, and I want more of it. And so, they're going to want to accelerate even the expectations they may have had for that pace to change. So, when you put all that mix together, it's fairly complex. But, it leaves us feeling we're going to have a considerable cross and upsell opportunity this year. And those incremental customers, significant customer, new adds that Cynthia talked about earlier from last year, over the course of this year, particularly the second half of this year, when a lot of those renewals come up, should be a great cross-sell opportunity. Yes. So, I'll be as candid as I can. So, we're enthusiastic, but we're also very cognizant of the fact that those are relationships to work at scale to take time to develop. Historically, as we've shared, the really large GSIs sort of looked at us and said, we aspire to someday be able to do more with DocuSign because we love the brand, we love the products, but there wasn't as much of an economic opportunity, particularly with signature only. And quite frankly, they came back and said, your software is too easy to use. It doesn't create enough economic opportunity for us. And we totally got it. And now, they're starting to look, as you said, the broader Agreement Cloud, and there's a lot of enthusiasm building there. But, if you said this year and we think about our sort of SI strategy, this year, fiscal year \u201822, I believe the bulk of the success we will get will be with the regional SIs this year but really starting to make traction with the GSIs. And probably next year is the year where I would be disappointed if we weren't really hitting the ground running with the GSIs, because they all want to be DocuSign partners. We just got to get that model right, so it can be significant enough for them for their business model. Yes. Well, Rob, let me -- I'll try to channel Mike for you best I can because I guess I should use a much deeper voice if I'm going to channel Mike. But the construct, I would say, is the work that we talked about the last couple of quarters was really the success that we needed in Europe was around coordination. We've grown very quickly. And we realized we wanted to put additional leadership to support the international growth because we weren't coordinated as well as we could across our own organization, so that our marketing team working with our sales teams, our sales teams working with our success and professional services teams, and we had real opportunity. And we've been pleased with that result. And we want to continue to have that focus and investment. There wasn't anything I'd say fundamentally broken with the business, but we did have some opportunity for better coordination. And I think that has helped us. But, I think in the end, as you heard us talk about earlier, at the beginning of the call, what's happened in international is it's coming into its own, and it's sitting at scale, just like we had the scale growth in our domestic business several years before. From a standpoint of the types of investments, I do think we will continually look at additional markets where we could have a bigger presence in those markets. Because of our web and mobile business, we sell well over 100 countries. But, we have these eight focus countries that we've put most of our effort against. And we continue to think that's the right strategy because there's just a lot more growth in those markets. But, over the course of this year, I would not be surprised to see us come forward and say another country or even two that we're going to sort of add to that list of the focus eight and start to go deeper. And then the last piece, I'd say, we are really investing aggressively in our digital strategy, which, of course, is global in nature. And I think it can be a significant part of growing our international business because that reach can get up to close to 200 countries. And we want to be leveraging that investment aggressively as part of international. Sure. Yes. In terms of the investment by category, it's sales and customer success. I mean, the core field is what we have built. And we're not -- we have product people in Europe and Paris, but the bulk of what we're building is the core field and then the support organizations, like marketing, like finance, like legal that are going to really support those teams in their growth. But, the core of it is sales and customer success. And then in terms of your question specifically about Asia and Asia Pacific, so I think we -- two things. One, we have -- historically thinking of the Asia Pacific market as all other and then Japan. We're actually starting to look at it now as a JPAC mindset. And we're increasingly looking at bringing leadership in to cover across those two businesses. A lot of software companies have very distinct Japanese businesses, and there's a lot of good reasons for that, the nature of how that economy works. But we think we have opportunity to be more successful broadly in Southeast Asia, if we leverage the strength we have in Japan and the strength we have had traditionally in the ANZ market. So, that's probably the best answer for what we're trying to do to address that. We do have a small presence in Singapore, which we think can be an important launching pad for other markets, in Southeast Asia. But at this point, we don't have plans to open additional offices in Asia. We really want to try to leverage what we've got in Sydney and Melbourne, Tokyo and Singapore. Well, I think for us, the competitive situation is -- a question earlier about competition is quite different in eSignature than it is in anything else, right? We have such a dramatic market share lead and, quite frankly, product capability lead in eSignature that it's -- there's just the competition I said is paper. It's not that there aren't other strong companies that are in the market, but just by the sheer size advantage that we have. And you heard us talk about this before. We spend more money on R&D than we think those folks have in revenue. So, from that standpoint, it's a very different dynamic, and we are one of the leaders in CLM, but there are other credible companies in the space. So, we do see a different competitive dynamic. You mentioned SAP and Ariba. Interestingly, SAP is much more of a partner really than a competitor. And increasingly, we're actually investing significantly in our integrations into Ariba to ensure that our CLM products will be industry-leading on the buy side as well as they are on the sell side today. But in general, I think your point is spot on. And it is a different competitive dynamic. And we're one of the leaders, but not the dramatic leader that we are in signature. And one other piece, I wouldn't look at it as a reduction in the capacity building in the second half. If you factor in the acquisitions that we did in the middle of the year, so if you look at the number of employees that we brought on with the Seal and the Liveoak Technologies, that sort of inflated a little bit in the middle of the year. So, if you smooth that out, I think you hear what Cynthia is saying is very consistent that we are continuing to invest in growth first. The performance of the business is such that we threw more to the bottom line than we expected. It's not a problem, but it's no way an indication that we're moving back from our focus on growth first. Thank you. Yes. So, we think about our business in verticals, for sure. And then, we have our geo business, right, which is quite substantial. But, in the verticals, the overall government vertical was incredibly strong for us in fiscal year '21, but it was very strong at state and local. And it wasn't as strong in federal. And I don't know that I have -- I mean, we could sort of hypothesize on what a pandemic does for certain types of governments or others. But, I think that there were so many kind of like health and human services aspects in the state and local, where they deliver those types of services to their populations that that really needed to happen in a quick way. And I think that federal agencies just had less of that and less of that urgency. So, from that standpoint, as we look forward to this year and we think about federal, I think we think it's a lot of opportunity, and there's a lot of almost pent-up sort of demand. Now, we run by the federal government. It's fantastic, but their pace of change there is sometimes not rapid. So, we wouldn't be surprised if some of those things take longer than we think, but we do see a pipe building of significant opportunities to add that to the good success we had in state and local this last year. Are you talking about our spending, or are you talking about customer spending? Yes. Well, so, we've sort of told our employees to give you some indication of that that they would not be required to return to DocuSign offices until October 4th. Now, we previously said June and had pushed out, it could push out again, obviously. But, that's our perspective that we wouldn't be back in any significant way before then. And Cynthia, do you want to talk a little bit how we've modeled the expenses from that standpoint and how that might change to try to give some perspective? I look at the bottom line and say, we've talked about continued increase in our profitability and our operating income, but not at the torrid rate that it improved in fiscal year '21 because we do want to focus on growth investing. Thank you so much, and thank you all for joining us. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we really hope you'll all be able to join us for our inaugural Analyst Day, and we'll look forward to seeing you there. Thank you."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. It\u2019s hard to believe that we are almost at the end of 2020 and just how challenging the year has been for so many people. Many companies, including DocuSign are still working remotely, collaborating virtually and balancing multiple demand.  However, we\u2019ve also seen the critical role that innovation can play at a time like this and how technology can help people adapt in the wake of the pandemic. As COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation of key business and agreement processes, DocuSign has become an increasingly essential cloud software platform. The last few quarters of heightened demand have offered a glimpse into the long-term growth opportunity we have. I want to share more on that with you today. So, I\u2019ll focus my comments in three main areas. One, strength of Q3\u2019s results; two, why believe today\u2019s Agreement Cloud customers will grow with us over the long-term; and three, the strength of our product development engine and partner ecosystem.  So Q3 was another exceptional quarter for us. We saw results significantly outperform this quarter with billings growth of 63% year over year and revenue growth of 53% year over year leading to record levels of profitability.  Our international business also showed substantial strength with revenue up 77% year-over-year, now representing only 20% of total revenue. We landed 73,000 new customers bringing our total to nearly 822,000 worldwide, and our customers expanded their use of DocuSign at the highest levels we\u2019ve seen to date yielding a net revenue retention rate of 122%.  These results reflect how the team has executed with excellence amid the ongoing challenges. They also showcased the continued tailwinds for the expansion of eSignature as the first step in the adoption of the Agreement Cloud.  Overall, the response to COVID-19 has caused organizations to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by two, three, four years or more. They\u2019ve seen that remote work can be even more productive, and the digital agreement processes are fast becoming business as usual. Let me share more on how our customers are doing that today.  One example is an international ecommerce customer. To ensure their business processes could keep pace with the growth driven by the pandemic, they deployed DocuSign CLM in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. By automating contract management for more than 1,500 different agreements with vendors and partners, they are lowering risks, costs, and errors.  Another example is one of our large U.S. public school districts. They needed to adapt quickly to help tens of thousands of employees and over 300,000 students to teach and learn remotely. By partnering with DocuSign, they completed Federal funding forms electronically and launched a virtual back-to-school program, and they are now planning hundreds of use cases to support other future needs.  One more example is a large U.S. insurance customer. As part of the response to COVID-19, the company expanded into several new eSignature use cases, which drove nearly 100,000 additional transactions over just the past seven months.  As I alluded to earlier, the insurer believes this will become business as usual from hereon in . This last point reinforces something that history has taught us at DocuSign. When customers go from paper-based processes to digital agreement processes, they do not go back. We believe that trend will hold when the pandemic subsides, and DocuSign\u2019s value will persist no matter how the future of work unfolds. We are not waiting for the future though, as we continue to innovate across the entire Agreement Cloud suite.  In September, we launched an important new product called DocuSign Analyzer. Imagine receiving a new contract from a vendor and having risks automatically flagged like a bad indemnification clause or the absence of a clause you\u2019d normally expect, Analyzer makes this possible. Thanks to the legal AI Technology we acquired with Seal Software earlier this year.  It\u2019s a fantastic timesaver for legal teams and their business stakeholders. It can also integrate with DocuSign CLM helping to automatically route work differently depending on analyzer\u2019s output, sending a high-risk contract to a more senior legal approver for example. I am pleased with how quickly we\u2019ve been able to apply Seal\u2019s technology in this new and exciting way.  Speaking of acquisitions, we talked last quarter about Liveoak Technologies, and how that would accelerate our efforts with DocuSign Notary. We are on track to deliver the beta version of the product before the end of this fiscal year. This will enable a notary transaction to occur entirely over video with the notary and participants all in different places.  It will also complement our existing capacity to support in-person and video conference-based notarization in the U.S. and the witnessing approach commonly used in the UK and EMEA. Our partner ecosystem was another area of strength and growth for Q3. As a reminder, this ecosystem includes ISVs that integrate DocuSign into their own solutions, systems integrators that build practices around the Agreement Cloud, and resellers to drive sales reach for us globally.  We continue to see overall traction with our more than 350 ISV integrations, including those announced in Q3 with Slack and with Workplace from Facebook. These follow a familiar pattern for us to make DocuSign available wherever business gets done. And with our recent momentum, we continue to see new partners join our ecosystem at a healthy clip. There is also been increased interest from SIs looking to build out Agreement Cloud practices that attach to their existing Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Workday practices thereby embedding DocuSign even deeper into critical front- and back-office business processes.  Lastly, our resellers including the likes of Carahsoft, Ingram Micro, and Insight to name just a few are seeing heightened demand for DocuSign too helping to drive sales through that channel. A great proof point is that Salesforce, as part of its revenue cloud business will now resell DocuSign Gen for Salesforce CPQ+, a product that generates agreements for Salesforce.  This creates incredible scale and reach, and typically leads to customers looking to DocuSign for broader agreement automation and CLM initiatives.  So, to wrap up my comments today, this is the third quarter in a row that we had these significant levels of growth. This acceleration in demand is laying the foundation for future expansion across the Agreement Cloud. And while substantial global, social, and economic challenges undoubtedly remain, we believe we are still just scratching the surface of our long-term opportunity. Before handing it over to Cynthia to walk you through our Q3 results in more detail, I want to share one other great piece of news. Cain Hayes, the CEO of Gateway Health has joined our Board of Directors. I am thrilled to have Cain providing strategic counsel to DocuSign and to me, especially given his track record in financial services and healthcare, two of our largest verticals.  So that is from me. Cynthia, over to you. \nCynthia Gaylor : Great. Thanks, Dan and thank you all for joining us today. As Dan mentioned, our Q3 execution was strong highlighted by our eSignature offering which drove the vast majority of our performance as customers continue to accelerate their digital initiatives.  Total revenue increased 53% year-over-year to $283 million, while billings increased 63% year-over-year to $440 million. Subscription revenue increased 54% year-over-year to $367 million. We saw strength across the business from geographies, verticals and customer types to new additions, renewals and upsells.   International revenue reached $76 million in the third quarter or 20% of total revenue. Our international business grew over 77% year-over-year reflecting our continued growth across geographies. This quarter we nearly tripled our new and direct customer additions compared to Q3 last year with nearly 73,000 total new customers, of which approximately 14,000 were direct customers.  This brings our total installed base to nearly 822,000 customers worldwide, an increase of 46% over last year. We ended the quarter with a 113,000 direct customers, a 64% increase. We saw further expansions in upsells from our existing customer base leading to record dollar net retention of 122% for the quarter. Customers with an annual sign greater than $300,000 grew 35% year-over-year totaling 542 customers.  Total non-GAAP gross margins and subscription gross margin for the third quarter were 79% and 84% respectively consistent with the year ago levels.  Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $253 million or 56% of total revenue in the quarter compared with a $180 million or 72% of total revenue in the third quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating profit was $49 million or 13% operating margin in the quarter compared to $17 million or 7% operating margin in the third quarter of last year.  Non-GAAP net income was $46 million in the third quarter, compared with $21 million in the third quarter last year. We ended the quarter with 5,364 employees, an increase of 445 over the same quarter last year. We exited the third quarter with nearly $676 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments.  Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $57 million. This compares with negative $2 million in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $38 million for the quarter. This compares with a negative $14 million a year ago. We expect our cash flow to continue to vary quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonality of our billing cycle and expenses.  Now on to our guidance. Amidst the ongoing macro uncertainties, we have seen tremendous demand for our products this year as businesses have accelerated their digital initiatives and moved quickly to adapt to the new environment. While we expect that digital first trends continue into the future and drive DocuSign growth at scale, the key growth rates of any given quarter may not be sustained indefinitely.  That being said, DocuSign\u2019s value proposition remains strong with our customers began using our products before or after the pandemic began. We don\u2019t see customers going back to pen and paper.  For the fourth quarter, and the fiscal year, we anticipate total revenue of $404 million to $408 million in Q4 and $1.426 billion to $1.43 billion for fiscal 2021. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $384 million to $388 million in Q4 and $1.355 billion to $1.359 billion for fiscal 2021.  For billings, we expect $512 million to $522 million in Q4 and $1.7 billion to $1.71 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q4 and fiscal 2021. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 42% to 44% of revenue for Q4 and 44% to 46% for fiscal 2021.  R&D in the range of 14% to 16% for Q4 and 13% to 15% for fiscal 2021 and G&A in the range of 9% to 11% for Q4 in fiscal 2021. For Q4, non-GAAP interest and others, we expect $1 million of expense to $1 million of income and for fiscal 2021, we expect $3 million to $5 million of non-GAAP interest and other income. We expect a tax provision of approximately $2 million to $3 million for Q4 and $7 million to $8 million for fiscal 2021.  Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for Q4 and 200 million to 205 million for fiscal 2021.  In closing, Q3 had strong results and execution across the board and we are off to a solid start in Q4. On a personal note, my first quarter as CFO has been incredible. And I\u2019d like to express my personal gratitude and excitement to be working alongside Dan and the entire DocuSign team.  I feel fortunate to have had a front row seat as a board member over the last few years and could not be more impressed and humbled by the team\u2019s dedication focus on our customers, our differentiated product portfolio and remarkable execution in these extraordinary times. Today, I am even more energized by the tremendous long-term opportunity in front of us.  Thank you again for joining us today. And now, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. \nSterling Auty : Thanks and welcome Cynthia to your first earnings call. Just one question from my side, and it\u2019s one that I get most from investors at the moment, and that is how much of your revenue growth is being impacted by existing customers that are either coming back to buy more envelopes or per seat pricing where they hit that level of reasonable volume and then they have to really kind of come in and either buy envelopes or upsell. So, if you can maybe quantify or characterize how much of that benefit, and when they do buy, what are they buying? So, are they going to a multi-year or just a bigger batch of envelopes, that\u2019d be great? Thank you. \nDan Springer: Yes, Sterling, I think the way to think about this is it\u2019s a little bit of all of the above, first off right. And if you think about our model which is a capacity model, so it\u2019s not a \u2013 like an overage model where you see in some businesses. So people are buying capacity, and oftentimes it happens just as you articulated people will come back and they say, \u201cyou know we\u2019ve used up our capacity and we need to renew,\u201d or sometime before they get to that point they\u2019ve used up the volume level that they\u2019ve sort of contracted with us to use, and they need to sort of true that up early, and we\u2019ll work with them to do an early renewal. And I think what we are seeing right now more than ever is that because people are putting more and more existing customers of their business processes on with DocuSign, they are more rapidly getting to a place where they\u2019ve used up that capacity. They might have planned it as a three-year growth, and at the end of the year and a half or two, they are not at that new level, so they are coming back to us saying we want to renew and up the volume. Some people do buy by seats, as you said. Most people buy by a message capacity when we are talking about our eSignature business, which of course is still the largest part of our business. But even if someone does buy on a seat basis, we have a reasonable use per seat. So in the end and the right way to think about the business is, it is messaging volume. It is the capacity of agreements they are putting through the system, it is what drives that increase in demand which then leads them to up the contract with us. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening and my sense about it is, it\u2019s really the faster adoption that\u2019s driving this, that\u2019s coming from people putting more and more of their use cases on to DocuSign. \nSterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. \nStan Zlotsky : Perfect. Thank you so much. Wanted to dig in for a second on just the adoption of the broader Agreement Cloud. What are you guys seeing as far as the ability to upsell the entire Agreement Cloud beyond just eSignatures, things like SpringCM Seal into your rapidly growing installed base? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nDan Springer: Let me give you a sense of the arc we\u2019ve had, Stan, over the last year. If you recall when we finished Q4 last year, the message we had was there was a fairly significant acceleration in particularly CLM, which was the major additional Agreement Cloud product we had at that time, and we were quite excited to see that coming into the New Year. And at the beginning of Q1, we saw that trend continuing. After COVID sort of hit and half way through our first quarter, we saw a fairly significant change. We saw customers coming back to us saying, yes, long-term, we want to be Agreement Cloud companies. But right now, we\u2019ve got some critical use cases that we need to get out for signature, and so we saw this dramatic acceleration on the signature side of the business and some slowing of deals and some slowing of those transactions of people who are working with us on the CLM side. I think we\u2019ve seen the same thing throughout the year. And in the last quarter or so, though we started to see that coming back. So, things like the Seal Software, things like CLM, those are now businesses that are returning to the levels we would have expected if they hadn\u2019t been for COVID. And we think CIOs and other business leaders fundamentally had a reaction upfront, which was I can only work on my critical projects. Remember, they were just like DocuSign having to go to a work from home setting and they weren\u2019t in their offices. And so, larger and more complex projects that require a systems integrator or at least some sort of statement of work. Those got pushed out a little bit. Now people are coming back and saying those are critical to our future, and so the Agreement Cloud is right back where we want it to be in terms of top of mind with our customers. And I\u2019ll just give you quick example. I had a call this morning with a very large customer of ours, and they said, \u201cHey, we are super excited to be now reaccelerating our plans to roll out CLM,\u201d while they have been dramatically increasing their signature usage over the course of the year. They said,\u201dNow is the time. We are ready to reaccelerate with CLM.\u201d And I think that\u2019s what we are going to see throughout the next few quarters. \nStan Zlotsky : Perfect. That makes lot of sense. And maybe a quick follow-up on international, 77% growth very nice acceleration in that segment of the business and might [ph] now are going to be at the helm of it. What are you guys seeing as far as the dynamics in international and rest of the world versus the U.S.? \nDan Springer: Well, I think there is a couple thoughts I have and then Cynthia chime in with your perspectives on what you are seeing. The first piece is, remember it\u2019s a much smaller number. So, we expect international to grow faster coming off a smaller base, but we also expect it to grow faster, because we have more levers there relative to the U.S. business in that we have additional countries that we are not in, and we have countries that we are very early in that we see an opportunity to really accelerate. That\u2019s I think what you saw in this last quarter is that a lot of the execution efforts we\u2019ve been putting in place over the last several quarters have really come out very nicely in this quarter and popping up to 20%, which is a really important milestone for us. So I still see that happen. I think you are going to see more of the same. You are going to see us doing more in our non-focus eight countries to the newer ones that we\u2019ll be entering primarily using digital as an opportunity to get there in the really efficient way and then in the existing core eight, I think you are going to see an opportunity for us to this U.S. and the other seven to really leverage the investments we\u2019ve made in people and processes investing ahead of that big opportunity for both countries that are substantial as already like you might see in a place like the UK or Canada or earlier like Germany and Japan, we see opportunities for both of those. So, I think you are going to see a really exciting opportunity to continue growth there. \nStan Zlotsky : Perfect. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. \nBhavan Suri: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question and Cynthia, good to chat and work with you again. It\u2019s a pleasure. I guess, let me touch on something that maybe Stan and Sterling touched on in a different fashion. I think you made it pretty clear and we all get it, no one is going back to pen and paper, but the growth and the acceleration which has been phenomenal. And I guess, do you feel like demand was pulled forward and how should we think? I know you are not giving guidance, but how should we think about next year, if we did see this acceleration pulls forward vertical that may have been slower to adopt accelerating that. How do we sort of handicap or think about that? And then I\u2019ve got a longer term question. \nDan Springer: Sure. And might we had Cynthia chat a little bit about sort of the timing particularly in Q3 and how we saw that play out versus Q4, and going forward, before that let me just give you sort of a high-level perspective. They way I would think about it is TAM based. So, I would start off and say, just talk about signature for a second. When we talk about the sort of $25 billion TAM, that was the same number we\u2019ve been using since the IPO and we continue to see that as a really good metric. We are seeing the opportunity. So, as fast as we are penetrating against that TAM, I think it\u2019s growing as fast. We are still in very early inning. And then when we are opening up the rest of the Agreement Cloud TAM, which is in the order of magnitude of almost doubling that, then we think to ourselves, we are actually not even keeping up with the TAM opportunity which is a high-class problem to have. And so, my view on it is that we\u2019ve seen is not so much a pulling forward of demand that therefore now won\u2019t happen in the future. But that when we are looking at the long game of all of that market opportunity to penetrate, we are just executing at a higher rate today. And so we\u2019ve accelerated that growth, not because we are sort of robbing from the future, but we are just getting closer towards that $25 billion TAM opportunity and with our revenue being under a couple billion and us having such a dramatic market share lead has been such a big portion of the total market. It gives you a sense that I think we can continue to grow at very attractive rates well into the future. \nCynthia Gaylor : Yes. And let me just \u2013 I would just add to that. I mean, Q3 was really strong and we saw broad based demand across the customer base, whether within new customers or in new expansions in upsells. And so, as Dan said, when you think about the TAM and that our market penetration, we are really just scratching the surface and the kind of new customer growth that we are seeing really creates the foundation for kind of future expansions in upsells kind of across the platform which we are pretty excited about. That being said, I do want to point out Q3 was exceptionally strong and we do see fairly renewals and expansions and tightening of deals that made some of the metrics in Q3, particularly strong on a relative basis year-on-year. And so, it\u2019s just something to consider kind of as you look to the future. \nBhavan Suri: Got you. Got you. Now that\u2019s really helpful. And I guess, maybe stepping back a little bit, you touched on AI and Dan you and I talked about this over the years just about sort of the broader opportunity. You explained sort of Seal and sort of some of the ability to re-contract. As you think about the amount of data you have, do you think they got to the point where you start doing sort of even deeper contract analysis, the point of you know, hey, you\u2019ve got a contract for x number of seats, you may not realized it but you have actually exceeded it or you haven\u2019t met it. Actually drilling into some of the numerical data in the contracts and then sort of either flagging it and that\u2019s just one example. But love to incent how deep you think the AI ultimately gets on the used cases, because that obviously ends up being a whole analytics TAM and a contract TAM that we aren\u2019t including today. \nDan Springer: Yes. It\u2019s a great way to think about it. And I think the way we have traditionally thought about the first phase of AI was things like the Analyzer product that I described earlier. We said this now gives our legal and business teams the ability to very quickly and efficiently understand where there are sort of outlier clauses or things they should pay particular attention to. But I actually think the most exciting part of that AI is where you are going with your question, which is once we have through a CLM that\u2019s enhanced with our AI capabilities, now companies have the ability to really learn about their business and make intelligent insights about their business based on that body of contracts that they have. And one of my favorite examples is that we see certain institutions saying, I want to understand my risk better, by understanding whether or not I have a whole bunch of contracts that are relevant to a particular sort of cost or something as an example we see this with companies in the chemicals industry to say, oil prices are hugely important to my business cause a variety of contracts have had a way to look across all of them and be thoughtful about what the puts and takes on that, so I can understand the risk and implication to my business by a move in that commodity price. So that\u2019s where I think the really exciting piece comes. And I think you are right, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve sort of looked at that in our existing TAM, because I don\u2019t think anyone has really built that market to help people do that analysis across all their agreements. And so, I think it is a part of our exciting future. \nBhavan Suri: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Congrats. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC. You may proceed with your question. \nAlex Zukin : Hey. Thanks. Cynthia, I like to add my congratulations and Dan, for you as well. I\u2019ve got a kind of two big picture questions. Dan, if you think about, I mean, going back to kind of Sterling\u2019s question around and even Bhavan\u2019s, the biggest question people have is around the durability of growth and you\u2019ve done a great job I think talking about some of the longer duration tailwinds to your business. How should we think around the puts and takes of certain verticals that may have surprisingly strong capacity increases this year that maybe are difficult comps for next year or the opposite verticals that have come back that you expect to actually sustain some of that capacity growth? Or is it as simple as we are starting to see a baton passing from eSignature to CLM that you see sustaining growth next year? And then I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up. \nDan Springer: I think it\u2019s a really interesting question. When we look at it from a vertical standpoint first, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, some of our strongest verticals and that would include financial services, both banking and insurance, that include healthcare life sciences, increasingly government is one we\u2019ve had a lot of enthusiasm about this year, as well. They\u2019ve actually performed incredibly well in this time period for us.  Some of the verticals that weren\u2019t as big for us that you would expect to have been hurt of course were, we saw that some small businesses, we definitely saw that travel and hospitality that where people had to sort of put on hold virtually everything as they really new to the trench. So, when you think about it going forward, I don\u2019t expect there could be a significant rotation out of our strong industries and the verticals, again, then we talk about financial services, we talk about healthcare life sciences, I think they are going to be very strong for us next year, as well.  The government strength we saw this year, I think, we expect to continue into the year as well. Whether there will be some bounce back with some of the things like travel and hospitality that we are hurt, I mean some energy businesses, as well, I think the answer is, probably. But I don\u2019t know what that cycle time is, I don\u2019t know whether in the first quarter or second quarter or maybe it\u2019s a couple quarters post back, I am not sure how that plays out exactly.  But I don\u2019t think that will be a significant driver as the second piece you talked about. And so, as Cynthia just alluded to this in her comment, but if you talk about we\u2019ve been adding such a significant number of new customers on the direct side of our business, 14,000 this quarter. It was 10,000 in each of Q1 and Q2. Those are primarily people coming in with eSignature only, because they need it to get those use cases up and running to get a really important priority for their business in this really challenging time.  Those are companies that we are going to aggressively be working a year from now to come back and say, hey, we want to talk to you in your renewal discussions around what additional use cases we have for signature. But also, I must tell you little more about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud and how that\u2019s going to transform your business in a way you might not even have thought about when you became a signature customer.  So that\u2019s the place where I think we\u2019ll see a bigger opportunity to really maintain substantial growth as Cynthia described. \nAlex Zukin : Perfect. And then, an even bigger picture question if I might. If you think about other platforms, software platforms have taken off during this pandemic, like the Zoom as an example, one of the things we are most excited about there is this notion of becoming having to control power end marketplace. I look at your business where you have a lot of network effects, is there a way to also create or see the marketplace for services where you start powering and even to some extent monetizing and adding value to both sides of the transaction? \nDan Springer: Yes. It\u2019s a super \u2013 super interesting, as you said, big picture question. So, when everyone gets newly introduced to DocuSign, I\u2019ll put myself in that category. Four years ago, one of the exciting things is thinking about all the possible places you can take this business and some because of the power of the data that was referred to earlier, but also the network effect that you are sort of describing in what could be a marketplace environment. So, let me really clear. We are a software company. We sell software to companies that use it to run their business. If their customers, their customers\u2019 data, we don\u2019t really think about that as information that\u2019s ours to sort of play with. So, that said, we do believe there are probably interesting opportunities where our customers over time could get comfortable with us say, hey, we want to monetize some of what\u2019s happened here in a different way. But I don\u2019t want to give you the sense that that\u2019s like a priority for us today. We look at the core business we had and we look again it has very large TAM. We need to execute for the next several years to achieve our goals of getting to $5 billion of revenue. And then after that, we are going to be talking about $10 billion in revenue. That\u2019s all going to be very achievable based on our current business model. So it\u2019s not that we are not interesting people here with interesting ideas about the expansion opportunities you are describing. I just want to be clear that\u2019s not part of the core business today. We are a software company. We serve our customers when they buy software from us. That will be, I believe the primary thing we do for the years to come. \nAlex Zukin : Awesome. Great to hear, Dan. We\u2019ll hold you to that $10 billion target. Thanks again. \nDan Springer: Any day now. Any day now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead : Thank you. And maybe one for Dan, one for Cynthia. Dan, if I could go back to the question of the upsell of the broader Agreement Cloud or CLM suite, you gave some good color. But I am wondering if you could quantify it a little bit. For instance, is there any way that you could quantify what portion of new ACV might be from this versus eSignature or the portion of your largest 100 customers that you\u2019ve successfully upsold the broader Agreement Cloud into anything that might more specifically let us know how far along that journey you are as exciting as it is? \nDan Springer: Yes, it\u2019s still pretty early in that journey. We are at a position right now where if you look at our financials, it\u2019s going to be a while before I believe the non-signature part of our business will be meaningful enough to sort of warrant that kind of break out. And when we done acquisitions like, what we did with Spring on the CLM side and what we did with Seal, we sort of shared what kind of the revenue was in those businesses. And if you recall, they are very, very small relative to a business that\u2019s passed the $1 billion last year and before long we\u2019ll be hitting $2 billion. So those are just really, really small at this point in time. The challenge is, initially I thought it would be sooner when we be having that conversation, but the reality is, is if this reacceleration of signature that\u2019s occurred this year, I mean, we started off, I\u2019d be really clear, we started every conversation with a customer today saying, we want to talk to you about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. That\u2019s every new customer, as well as each customer we come into talk about renewals. But we\u2019ve also this year more than ever, and we\u2019ve finished that sort of explanation or articulation of the power of that Agreement Cloud vision. Most of them this year have said, that\u2019s fantastic and I look forward to doing that, but I need some signature today. And as I tell our sales people, there is only one answer to that question, which is, yes ma\u2019am or yes sir, we\u2019ve got signature for you today. And so, I think you are going to see that, that is going to be the reality of the next I would say several quarters, we are still seeing this demand as just so strong on signature. And it\u2019s almost hard for the folks that are CLM focused or Seal focused to sort of get attention to keep up with that rate. So, Cynthia, you can give a perspective on your thoughts on when we\u2019d be in a position to talk about that further. But I just don\u2019t think we can really quantify it yet, because it\u2019s still so small. \nKarl Keirstead : Got it. Okay. And maybe this next question is to, Cynthia, and Cynthia, you are probably going to dodge us, I understand. But, one of the issues with DocuSign shares is that you are about to say some very tough comps starting in Q1 next year. So, I am sure you don\u2019t want to give guide on this call, but is there any framework you can provide? Should we think about sort of a return to pre-COVID sequential growth rates as a starting point to model next year? Is there any framework you could provide before maybe giving more formalized guidance, I presume on the next call? \nCynthia Gaylor : Yes. That\u2019s right. And thank you for the questions. We\u2019ll be giving guidance for next year on our Q4 call. I think what you got though is we will have tough compares going into next year and even in Q4, our Q4 last year was very strong and it was a significant quarter on its own sight. I would expect going into next year, we\u2019ll be looking at kind of the guidance and we\u2019ll be looking across the matters and as you know we guide to what we see and so, we\u2019ll have that conversation next quarter when we chat with you all. \nKarl Keirstead : Yes. I get it. Thank you both. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham and Company. You may proceed with your question. \nUnidentified Analyst: Well, this is Alex on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. As you look back over the last two quarters, either the composition of the initial purchase of the channel that the customers are coming to change meaningfully or have deals been coming in similarly to what pre-pandemic compositions were and or was there just a larger quantity \u2013 that\u2019s been happening? \nDan Springer: Yes, I can tell you, the deals that we have coming in have had a higher focus on signature in the last few quarters and as I mentioned before, we saw that that was growing for these rest of the Agreement Cloud going up to Q4 of last year and into the beginning of Q1 this year and then Signature has just been explosive for all the good reasons we\u2019ve already talked about. And so, as I stated there is an increase in that mix in that direction. But I would say, the rest of the green side that have been holding it just hasn\u2019t been growing its share the way it had been growing substantially, again off of very, very small base, but growing its position there. And then from a standpoint of the channels, we\u2019ve been investing a lot in the digital channel versus the direct sales channel. It\u2019s still about 15% of our revenue, plus almost 90% of our customers and I think that, we\u2019ve seen real strength there. And I think, we are going to continue to see strength and you are going to see us talking in the future about the investments we want to make to move even more and more of our customer in new acquisitions to come through the digital business, which we think is going to be a super cost-effective way for us to scale our growth. \nCynthia Gaylor : Yes. One thing I would just add to that is, is that you do look at the customer growth numbers, whether it\u2019s the total or the direct versus digital, you can really see that strength kind of across the board up and down the customer base. And so, it really is kind of broad based within that and that we are seeing across customers and companies. \nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. And then just one more for me. Given Salesforce acquisition next week, that seems to have a broader implication to valuation with that. How are you thinking about M&A valuations giving your willing appetite for M&A in the past? \nDan Springer: Yes, I think, we\u2019ve been very specific about what we\u2019ve tried to do with our M&A strategy, which is to say, we are not looking from a strategy standpoint for sort of blockbuster deals in terms of buy lots of revenue per se. We\u2019ve been trying to stick to our strategy that we think our customers want us to drive which is the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. So, when we do acquisitions, like you think about the three deals we\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been here, you\u2019ll see they all have very similar characteristics, which is someone has a product, probably not super mature business, but are products that we look at and say, we need to have that functionality in our Agreement Cloud suite and we could build it on our own, but we think that they have some domain expertise. We think that it built a little bit of a business there. They\u2019ve sort of got a market fit that we are \u2013 a product market fit that we are comfortable with. And we think it will accelerate our ability to build out those products and services for our customers. I think we\u2019ll probably be looking at doing the same thing.  So in terms of the valuation question, I am certain that the issue we already have today when we acquire a company, and they look at us and they go, we love you to buy us at the same multiple that DocuSign has. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change and I\u2019ll start with that position and politely I\u2019ll probably remind them that we\u2019ve achieved some things in our business as they probably haven\u2019t yet in terms of scale, growth and profitability. And therefore we might not \u2013 as we have not yet come close to giving some on the same multiple that we have. But I don\u2019t think other deals like Slack deal will fundamentally change the perspective of valuations and just my view on it is, they paid a slight premium to the peak multiple that Slack had. And that to me is sort of more of the same as opposed to sort of earth shattering multiple. But I think it is obviously clear that for entrepreneurs out there with that business is it probably makes them smile. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Group. You may proceed with your question. \nPatrick Walravens : Great. Thank you, and congratulations. So, Dan, what is the top priority today for your development organization, like where are you concentrating your R&D dollars? What do you want the solutions to do in the future that it can\u2019t do today? \nDan Springer: So, I put it in three buckets, and I\u2019ll do them in priority order for you since you are asking about top, but it\u2019s kind of hard not to think about them all three, Pat, for me. The first one is, this sort of integration of the AI capability that we had \u2013 we purchased with Seal and Analyzer is the first example that\u2019s fantastic. But there is a ton more where we take that AI capability and bring it into our overall product suite, so we have a huge focus on integrating that team and integrating that technology, we think it\u2019s going to be as we talked about on earlier questions, hugely important part of building this significant opportunity that we have.  Second piece is, Notary. I think we look at this Notary and a lot of people think of it is a - as a smaller thing. We think it can actually be really significant. There is third-party Notary. There is going to be first-party Notary that we are attacking first, but we think that opportunity there is a very specific thing that we are aggressively going after and then we think about that as being part of our sign business, as opposed to really a separate component. But clearly, it\u2019s an additional growth opportunity for us on the sign side.  And then the third piece for me is, it really is about this macro opportunity of the Agreement Cloud and making sure we are stitching together all of the pieces that one thing as we buy these other companies sometimes they are small, they don\u2019t have our kind of uptime capability. They don\u2019t have the quality of service that we have and they are not integrated completely to using partners that we sort of jointly sold before. We have APIs, but we haven\u2019t really fully integrated them into a one platform. And so, I think getting that platform, the place where we want it to be will be the third of those important development priority. \nPatrick Walravens : That\u2019s helpful. Alright. Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. You may proceed with your question. \nWalter Pritchard : Hi. Thank you. First question for Cynthia. Just on NRR, I mean, I think, we\u2019ve seen a lot of times when companies add a lot of customers like that, the number start get bigger that the NRR comes down. You\u2019ve actually seen it go the opposite direction. I am just wondering if you can help us understand sort of the puts and takes over the next couple quarters on NRR as we are looking at that number and how it trends. \nCynthia Gaylor : Yes. So, I think that, as I said, that we hit a record in net retention numbers this quarter at the 122. It\u2019s a second time we\u2019ve been at 120 or greater and I think that was really driven by the expansions in upsells that we saw across the board, as Dan said, led mainly by eSignature, but also kind of building the \u2013 opportunity. So, I would say, as you know, our churn has largely been stable in regards to that, but the expansions are really driven by the sales that we saw in Q3. \nDan Springer: Yes. And I think your question about the implication going forward, I think the first implication is just what you said is that our customers are saying they want to do more DocuSign. They want to use this in different ways. And I think we continue to see that both within the signature business and Cynthia was describing, but also customers saying they want to expand into that for the Agreement Cloud, which also gives us another way to turbo charge that number. At the same time, I think as we go forward, we are not at this point changing our historic change that we talked about since the time of the IPO of saying that\u2019s going to be kind of in that piece, 112, 113 on the low end and to get up to a 119 or so on the high end. But let\u2019s get through this year, get through Q4 and see if then maybe want to reassess that because there are some puts and takes. There are some adjustments. We do think about the potential for churn. We don\u2019t have this as long as the pandemic is going to last and I have a lot of enthusiasm about a vaccine. But I think that\u2019s going to, in the next quarter or two, have a significant impact on the economy and we do worry about small businesses. So I think we just want to give us another quarter and then if we are going to take a hard look at that, and assess whether the success we\u2019ve had would lead us to increasing our expectation for that range going forward and I agree with you it\u2019s somewhat unusual to see an accelerating rate there. But I think we are somewhat unusual as a company again that we have such a strong market leadership position and such a large TAM that I think is conceivable that we could continue to see that kind of acceleration. \nWalter Pritchard : Got it. And then, actually another question for you, Cynthia. On OpEx, I mean, I think we are seeing a lot of companies in this environment actually see the OpEx growth significantly tampered by COVID lack of see me and so forth. Your OpEx has actually grown in line with what it grew last year and I am just wondering where you sort of hit the gap to accelerate that OpEx? I assume you saw the same lack of see me and so forth. And then, how are you thinking about OpEx going forward and return on the investments that you are making? \nCynthia Gaylor : Yes. It\u2019s a great question. I think what we are trying to invest for top-line growth, right and sometimes when you had outperformance on the top-line, it\u2019s hard to reinvest that in the quarter at the same REIT. We got 6 points of margin improvement year-on-year. The areas that we are really kind of lean heavily into grow the top-line is around sales and marketing, particularly capacity, customer get backs and then product innovation and all the areas that Dan talked about on one of the earlier questions that we\u2019ll make dollar trade-offs to grow top-line before we improve margin. But I think the outperformance that we are seeing is driving to pretty impressive levels year-on-year. \nWalter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. \nTaylor McGinnis : Yes. Hi. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. So, you\u2019ve had a record number of underprice in commercial customer adds the last three quarters. So, just as we look ahead into next year and beyond, can you maybe talk about any expectations you have for how you expect those customers to ramp over time? I am curious if you have seen any changes in trends or trends in the size of lands today and how those customers expect to expand usage and maybe similar to one of the previous questions, what does that say about the durability of the net retention levels we\u2019ve seen recently? \nDan Springer: Yes. Interesting there has not been a lot of variation on that front. So the sizes of lands, the pricing of the deals what we\u2019ve been doing, they\u2019ve been then amazingly consistent even though the volume as you point out has been more substantial. There has been a small amount of mix shift, I talked about the direct business being very strong for us. But we\u2019ve also seen those web upgrades that we talked about where we call that positive churn. Someone comes to us on the digital business and they get \u2013 they start growing with us and we create a direct relationship with them with the sales person being involved. And so, that\u2019s been accelerating and taking a bigger part of our business sort of pulling them out of the digital business if you will. So, it\u2019s nothing I\u2019d point you, Taylor, that sort of seems to me fundamentally different that would give us any reason to expect that the journey, the customers would take in terms of their growth coming from that land and expand would be different. And then, to get to the second part of your question, what would that implication for the retention rate will be, it maybe some \u2013 a mass piece that over my head that I am missing. But I would expect it probably then to not have a significant impact on the retention rate if there was nothing different in the nature of those lands. So, but my guess, would be, but I give you a little more thought, I guess, we wouldn\u2019t see any change in that path that customers that average path, customers are taking with us for this new crop of new customers that are coming in even though they are bigger class, I think \u2013 we think they would probably perform the same way previous classes had as well. \nTaylor McGinnis : Great. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question. \nKoji Ikeda : Hey, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask you a question on DocuSign\u2019s branding and really specifically internationally, from our lands in the U.S., that it sort of seems like DocuSign has a great chance of becoming the next brand to become a verb like your Xerox, as an Ubers and CleanX maybe it already has, but what about internationally? Does DocuSign already have that sort of market awareness and positioning internationally? Or is that still the comp? \nDan Springer: Yes. So it\u2019s great question. In fact, Forrester did couple years ago put out a report saying we already had become a brand. I think that same way you talked about like CleanX or Xerox. So, Koji, we are a step ahead. We already got that piece done in the U.S. as you indicated. We just actually recently did a study couple months ago and Rob Giglio, our CMO looked at our brand in a variety of different markets and what we found is that the aided awareness was quite strong. But the unaided awareness was not as strong as it might be and clearly not as is in the U.S. and the fundamental difference is that, in the U.S. recall that we took a very significant position within the real estate space and so many people when buying homes or leasing apartments got familiar with using DocuSign. So it\u2019s at a point that, if I go some places I work at DocuSign the vast, vast majority of the people get what we call Docu love story and they come back and tell, gosh, I was traveling on a vacation, and was able to buy a home or I started a new job and I was able to sign that when I was traveling and all those wonderful stories that you and I talked about that happens with our brand. If you are in different markets overseas, particularly some of the markets where we have had sort of less growth and I\u2019d put sort of the Germanys and Japans as an example if we don\u2019t have that same brand awareness. It\u2019s starting to happen and we are going to be looking in the coming years to invest in different ways to build that greater brand awareness because the real estate market won\u2019t be the same. It\u2019s just very different in the U.S. than it is most other countries. It won\u2019t give us that same vehicle to do it. We are looking at focusing on our digital business and using digital advertising, which of course is customer acquisition-oriented. But we\u2019ll also have a component of brand building for us. So that\u2019s going to be a big part of our marketing plan in the coming year. And I will look forward to at some point during the year, given the opportunity to share with you all what we are seeing in terms of success of those investments. But the last thing I would tell you is, even though we, in some of these countries do not have the same sort of leadership position of our brand, nobody else does either. So when we get to those other markets, there is no other DocuSign of with that same sort of presence in another country. So we haven\u2019t lost that opportunity to take that global leadership position in each of the key international markets where want to be and that\u2019s what we intend to do just that. \nKoji Ikeda : Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And just one follow-up question on the government opportunity. I know you guys been talking about your IO4 government datacenter. Could you please remind us is that certified now? And if it is, how do we think about the certified datacenter and your certification. I mean, could 2021 be an inflection year from the government opportunity? I mean, what sort of go to market investments are you making for that government vertical opportunity. Thanks for taking my questions. \nDan Springer: Yes. The IO4 is actually built and it\u2019s operational and we\u2019ve actually put volume through it. There is additional an organization called DIFA more than probably everyone know in the Federal government has a final certification requirement that we expect shortly. But we are already working with agencies on that functionality and capability and we are excited about it the same way when we got Fed ramp certification. We continue to put ourselves in a position with the Federal government, and by the way it does trickle down a lot of states really look at that as being important even if they don\u2019t necessarily require the certification, it gives them comfort. So we see that in local and state governments as well. And we think we feel really good about that positioning as the sort of preeminent provider in the agreement space to the agencies. So, from a standpoint \u2013 when you said \u201821, I assume you meant calendar \u201821 not fiscal \u201921 and we actually think fiscal \u201921 this past year has actually been, I don\u2019t think a lot of inflection point, but incredibly strong for us in government and so many agencies now have requirements to do things, particularly around eSignature with a company like DocuSign. So, we expect that to continue to be a strength. I think we are looking at different ways that we can invest in sort of the marketing to be more effective and getting the breadth of our message out to all the different particularly Federal agencies. And I think, well, I think we\u2019ve done good sales execution. I would say that we have an opportunity to a better job on sort of marketing and business development aspects at sort of the top side of that funnel with the various government agencies. And so, we will look at that in fiscal \u201922, calendar \u201921 to accelerate that to do even more. \nKoji Ikeda : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciated. \nDan Springer: Thank you, Koji. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. You may proceed with your question. \nRishi Jaluria : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice to see continued acceleration on the business. I just wanted to go back to the ongoing theme of the questions which is thinking about DocuSign in the post-pandemic world, Dan, what I understand we are not going back to pen and paper we are doing things, but you also talked about how customers are accelerating their digital transformation by three to four years. As you think about that post-pandemic world and given all the high expansion rates and everything you are seeing, does that pace of acceleration maybe slow down now that there is less urgency with the remote work or is there enough opportunity in the land that you\u2019ve gotten with the core digital signature product that you can keep up that sort of acceleration with your cross-selling getting people in the CLM. Maybe help us understand how you think about that? Thanks. \nDan Springer: Yes. So let me tell what I know and what I don\u2019t know. What I know is what Cynthia just reported to you which we had some that I can say for the last three quarters, the highest rate of billings growth we\u2019ve ever had in our history and didn\u2019t think that what happened this quarter after last quarter and it did given the compare in Q4, as you see the guide, I don\u2019t think we would say we expect that to happen again by any means next quarter. But the growth has been very strong and has been consistent. So the tricky part to your question is in the post-pandemic, I have no idea when that\u2019s coming and anymore than anything other people on this call, my sense is that, it has been accelerant to our business. So there would be some lack of that accelerant in the \u2013 occurring in a post-pandemic world. But at the same time I think the second part of your question which is really important is, we are also hitting our stride with the capabilities we have in the rest of the Agreement Cloud. And we\u2019ve also built a lot of sales capacity right as we\u2019ve seen this opportunity and because the TAM is so big, I think the biggest determinant of our ability to grow is our ability to onboard quality people that can build the software that we need and then represent and sell that software into the marketplace so we can then work with that customers success to drive adoption. So, if we can continue to scale our team effectively, I think we can continue to grow at very exciting rates. So I think that\u2019s kind of how I look at it right now. And I do think it\u2019s going to be a little while before we realize what the new normal will be and what we said the last couple of quarters but I still think is what we say it today is that, at some point, the sort of enormity of the tailwind that is there will be less enormous, but it may be substantial that people have said digital transformation is what I need now and they flip the bet and we will continue to see strong growth of that. But my assumption not really having any detailed ability to guess the future is that that growth will be at a higher rate than we were at pre-COVID happening, but probably not at the same growth rate that we\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters where it\u2019s been amazingly heightened. So, I think it will be very strong growth and probably higher than you\u2019ve seen previously. And so when we look at our revenue growth I think you\u2019ll see next quarter when Cynthia pulls together. I think what you will see is an exciting growth future for us and probably from a billing standpoint, slightly below the incredible numbers we\u2019ve put up the last few quarters. \nRishi Jaluria : It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. \nCynthia Gaylor : One thing I would just add to that is just keep in mind when we get there we will be at considerable scale from where we were this time last year, right. And so, the growth number that we are posting is \u2013 aren\u2019t considerably bigger absolute numbers. And so it\u2019s just something to be mindful of it when you go over it. \nRishi Jaluria : Got it. Thanks, Dan and Cynthia. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question. \nMichael Turrin : Hey there. Thanks and good afternoon. Just one from me. We\u2019ve spoken with members of your ecosystem who seem particularly excited about the DocuSign insight technology and opportunity in there? Just wondering if there is more you can tell us around that value proposition and how insight maybe fits with some of the overall Agreement Cloud vision? Thank you. \nDan Springer: So, you are saying the Insight as a partner. \nMichael Turrin : Yes. The Seal technology being used, not Insight the partner, the DocuSign insight technology which led \u2013 where it\u2019s a feel in for the contract and all those? \nDan Springer: Yes, absolutely, sorry, I got confused on the partner side. Yes, so, I would say that, we think it\u2019s a significant part and one of the things that\u2019s interesting when you think about our partners, and this happened before we did the CLM acquisition of Spring CM where people previously had said, yes we love DocuSign, customers love DocuSign, but software is pretty good. It\u2019s pretty easy to implement and there is not really an opportunity for us to make enough money in sort of implementing it. Then with Spring, we saw people say, hey, you are getting into a broader base software tool that requires a significantly SOW to be installed and there is real opportunity. And we saw the SI community sort of work with us more aggressively to become partners and we see that happening more so, because of Insight. And I think people realize there is a lot of opportunity to deliver fantastic value for our end joint customers if they are providing services. So, I one of you have heard us talk about is we are actually trying to decrease even though it\u2019s a small \u2013 I am talking about 4% of our revenue being services, decreasing that as a percentage going forward not because we are going to reduce the service as we do, but we are just going to move so much more at the growth into the partner ecosystem. So that\u2019s kind of how we look at that. We think it\u2019s going to be a significant piece with a lot of excitement about partners and particularly SIs that want to leverage Insight into the work they do with our joint customers. \nMichael Turrin : Helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question. \nKirk Materne : Thanks. And thanks for squeezing me in. Dan, I was just curious when you think about all the new direct customers that you\u2019ve blended over the last couple quarters. I realize they don\u2019t have necessarily the time to talk about the full sort of \u2013 right now with you. But are they at the right level in the organization to have that question that conversation say a year from now meaning, are you landing higher up in your customer organization, so that when they are raising and coming back around and have that discussion there at the level that the kind of business process changes required or really that could help change the entire business that they have the authority frankly to just starting to have those conversations, because you are obviously getting into CLM. It opens up so many interesting sort of avenues from a business process perspective. So, just sort the sum is, are you landing high enough up to start those conversations? Thanks. \nDan Springer: Yes, that\u2019s really thoughtful question. So, first off the danger is, I look at my dataset of the customers I\u2019ve spoken with. We got 34,000 new direct customers in the first nine months. I didn\u2019t talk to too many of them myself. But I would tell you from a trend standpoint I haven\u2019t seen something that feels fundamentally different. So I don\u2019t think we are landing higher or landing lower for that matter. I think our enterprise business has done really well. So it\u2019s probably \u2013 maybe - might be a little mix shift from that standpoint to growth there in more senior relationships. But I can tell you this that we do not have field personnel that do not start now every conversation with the Agreement Cloud. And as I mentioned earlier, just we don\u2019t let someone go out and even if get in RFP in or someone calls up and just says, give me signature right now, you are going to listen to a DocuSign Agreement Cloud pitch I mean it\u2019s going to talk to you of how you are going to prepare, sign, act on and manage your agreements with DocuSign. And that wouldn\u2019t have been true a year ago. We wouldn\u2019t had that in the field enabled to do that. So we are actually doing that. So, my guess is that, anything that\u2019s probably a slight, slight move towards people who are coming in whether they are more senior or not, but they are coming in with a mindset that this is an Agreement Cloud company and this is where they should be going with us and that\u2019s why I first see is probably the trend moving in the future. \nKirk Materne : Okay. Thanks and congrats on the results. \nDan Springer: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the time limit for this question and answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to management for closing remarks. \nDan Springer: Thank you so much, operator. Hey, thank you guys for joining us. As Annie said, we are going to be up on the road some opportunity to see you all. We are obviously incredibly excited about the business and the performance we have. And we\u2019ll look forward to seeing you all in the near future. Cheers. \nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Dan and thank you all for joining us today. As Dan mentioned, our Q3 execution was strong highlighted by our eSignature offering which drove the vast majority of our performance as customers continue to accelerate their digital initiatives.  Total revenue increased 53% year-over-year to $283 million, while billings increased 63% year-over-year to $440 million. Subscription revenue increased 54% year-over-year to $367 million. We saw strength across the business from geographies, verticals and customer types to new additions, renewals and upsells.   International revenue reached $76 million in the third quarter or 20% of total revenue. Our international business grew over 77% year-over-year reflecting our continued growth across geographies. This quarter we nearly tripled our new and direct customer additions compared to Q3 last year with nearly 73,000 total new customers, of which approximately 14,000 were direct customers.  This brings our total installed base to nearly 822,000 customers worldwide, an increase of 46% over last year. We ended the quarter with a 113,000 direct customers, a 64% increase. We saw further expansions in upsells from our existing customer base leading to record dollar net retention of 122% for the quarter. Customers with an annual sign greater than $300,000 grew 35% year-over-year totaling 542 customers.  Total non-GAAP gross margins and subscription gross margin for the third quarter were 79% and 84% respectively consistent with the year ago levels.  Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $253 million or 56% of total revenue in the quarter compared with a $180 million or 72% of total revenue in the third quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating profit was $49 million or 13% operating margin in the quarter compared to $17 million or 7% operating margin in the third quarter of last year.  Non-GAAP net income was $46 million in the third quarter, compared with $21 million in the third quarter last year. We ended the quarter with 5,364 employees, an increase of 445 over the same quarter last year. We exited the third quarter with nearly $676 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments.  Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $57 million. This compares with negative $2 million in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $38 million for the quarter. This compares with a negative $14 million a year ago. We expect our cash flow to continue to vary quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonality of our billing cycle and expenses.  Now on to our guidance. Amidst the ongoing macro uncertainties, we have seen tremendous demand for our products this year as businesses have accelerated their digital initiatives and moved quickly to adapt to the new environment. While we expect that digital first trends continue into the future and drive DocuSign growth at scale, the key growth rates of any given quarter may not be sustained indefinitely.  That being said, DocuSign's value proposition remains strong with our customers began using our products before or after the pandemic began. We don't see customers going back to pen and paper.  For the fourth quarter, and the fiscal year, we anticipate total revenue of $404 million to $408 million in Q4 and $1.426 billion to $1.43 billion for fiscal 2021. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $384 million to $388 million in Q4 and $1.355 billion to $1.359 billion for fiscal 2021.  For billings, we expect $512 million to $522 million in Q4 and $1.7 billion to $1.71 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q4 and fiscal 2021. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 42% to 44% of revenue for Q4 and 44% to 46% for fiscal 2021.  R&D in the range of 14% to 16% for Q4 and 13% to 15% for fiscal 2021 and G&A in the range of 9% to 11% for Q4 in fiscal 2021. For Q4, non-GAAP interest and others, we expect $1 million of expense to $1 million of income and for fiscal 2021, we expect $3 million to $5 million of non-GAAP interest and other income. We expect a tax provision of approximately $2 million to $3 million for Q4 and $7 million to $8 million for fiscal 2021.  Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for Q4 and 200 million to 205 million for fiscal 2021.  In closing, Q3 had strong results and execution across the board and we are off to a solid start in Q4. On a personal note, my first quarter as CFO has been incredible. And I'd like to express my personal gratitude and excitement to be working alongside Dan and the entire DocuSign team.  I feel fortunate to have had a front row seat as a board member over the last few years and could not be more impressed and humbled by the team's dedication focus on our customers, our differentiated product portfolio and remarkable execution in these extraordinary times. Today, I am even more energized by the tremendous long-term opportunity in front of us.  Thank you again for joining us today. And now, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Yes. And let me just \u2013 I would just add to that. I mean, Q3 was really strong and we saw broad based demand across the customer base, whether within new customers or in new expansions in upsells. And so, as Dan said, when you think about the TAM and that our market penetration, we are really just scratching the surface and the kind of new customer growth that we are seeing really creates the foundation for kind of future expansions in upsells kind of across the platform which we are pretty excited about. That being said, I do want to point out Q3 was exceptionally strong and we do see fairly renewals and expansions and tightening of deals that made some of the metrics in Q3, particularly strong on a relative basis year-on-year. And so, it's just something to consider kind of as you look to the future. Yes. That's right. And thank you for the questions. We'll be giving guidance for next year on our Q4 call. I think what you got though is we will have tough compares going into next year and even in Q4, our Q4 last year was very strong and it was a significant quarter on its own sight. I would expect going into next year, we'll be looking at kind of the guidance and we'll be looking across the matters and as you know we guide to what we see and so, we'll have that conversation next quarter when we chat with you all. Yes. One thing I would just add to that is, is that you do look at the customer growth numbers, whether it's the total or the direct versus digital, you can really see that strength kind of across the board up and down the customer base. And so, it really is kind of broad based within that and that we are seeing across customers and companies. Yes. So, I think that, as I said, that we hit a record in net retention numbers this quarter at the 122. It's a second time we've been at 120 or greater and I think that was really driven by the expansions in upsells that we saw across the board, as Dan said, led mainly by eSignature, but also kind of building the \u2013 opportunity. So, I would say, as you know, our churn has largely been stable in regards to that, but the expansions are really driven by the sales that we saw in Q3. Yes. It's a great question. I think what we are trying to invest for top-line growth, right and sometimes when you had outperformance on the top-line, it's hard to reinvest that in the quarter at the same REIT. We got 6 points of margin improvement year-on-year. The areas that we are really kind of lean heavily into grow the top-line is around sales and marketing, particularly capacity, customer get backs and then product innovation and all the areas that Dan talked about on one of the earlier questions that we'll make dollar trade-offs to grow top-line before we improve margin. But I think the outperformance that we are seeing is driving to pretty impressive levels year-on-year. One thing I would just add to that is just keep in mind when we get there we will be at considerable scale from where we were this time last year, right. And so, the growth number that we are posting is \u2013 aren't considerably bigger absolute numbers. And so it's just something to be mindful of it when you go over it."

            "content": "Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. It's hard to believe that we are almost at the end of 2020 and just how challenging the year has been for so many people. Many companies, including DocuSign are still working remotely, collaborating virtually and balancing multiple demand.  However, we've also seen the critical role that innovation can play at a time like this and how technology can help people adapt in the wake of the pandemic. As COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation of key business and agreement processes, DocuSign has become an increasingly essential cloud software platform. The last few quarters of heightened demand have offered a glimpse into the long-term growth opportunity we have. I want to share more on that with you today. So, I'll focus my comments in three main areas. One, strength of Q3's results; two, why believe today's Agreement Cloud customers will grow with us over the long-term; and three, the strength of our product development engine and partner ecosystem.  So Q3 was another exceptional quarter for us. We saw results significantly outperform this quarter with billings growth of 63% year over year and revenue growth of 53% year over year leading to record levels of profitability.  Our international business also showed substantial strength with revenue up 77% year-over-year, now representing only 20% of total revenue. We landed 73,000 new customers bringing our total to nearly 822,000 worldwide, and our customers expanded their use of DocuSign at the highest levels we've seen to date yielding a net revenue retention rate of 122%.  These results reflect how the team has executed with excellence amid the ongoing challenges. They also showcased the continued tailwinds for the expansion of eSignature as the first step in the adoption of the Agreement Cloud.  Overall, the response to COVID-19 has caused organizations to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by two, three, four years or more. They've seen that remote work can be even more productive, and the digital agreement processes are fast becoming business as usual. Let me share more on how our customers are doing that today.  One example is an international ecommerce customer. To ensure their business processes could keep pace with the growth driven by the pandemic, they deployed DocuSign CLM in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. By automating contract management for more than 1,500 different agreements with vendors and partners, they are lowering risks, costs, and errors.  Another example is one of our large U.S. public school districts. They needed to adapt quickly to help tens of thousands of employees and over 300,000 students to teach and learn remotely. By partnering with DocuSign, they completed Federal funding forms electronically and launched a virtual back-to-school program, and they are now planning hundreds of use cases to support other future needs.  One more example is a large U.S. insurance customer. As part of the response to COVID-19, the company expanded into several new eSignature use cases, which drove nearly 100,000 additional transactions over just the past seven months.  As I alluded to earlier, the insurer believes this will become business as usual from hereon in . This last point reinforces something that history has taught us at DocuSign. When customers go from paper-based processes to digital agreement processes, they do not go back. We believe that trend will hold when the pandemic subsides, and DocuSign's value will persist no matter how the future of work unfolds. We are not waiting for the future though, as we continue to innovate across the entire Agreement Cloud suite.  In September, we launched an important new product called DocuSign Analyzer. Imagine receiving a new contract from a vendor and having risks automatically flagged like a bad indemnification clause or the absence of a clause you'd normally expect, Analyzer makes this possible. Thanks to the legal AI Technology we acquired with Seal Software earlier this year.  It's a fantastic timesaver for legal teams and their business stakeholders. It can also integrate with DocuSign CLM helping to automatically route work differently depending on analyzer's output, sending a high-risk contract to a more senior legal approver for example. I am pleased with how quickly we've been able to apply Seal's technology in this new and exciting way.  Speaking of acquisitions, we talked last quarter about Liveoak Technologies, and how that would accelerate our efforts with DocuSign Notary. We are on track to deliver the beta version of the product before the end of this fiscal year. This will enable a notary transaction to occur entirely over video with the notary and participants all in different places.  It will also complement our existing capacity to support in-person and video conference-based notarization in the U.S. and the witnessing approach commonly used in the UK and EMEA. Our partner ecosystem was another area of strength and growth for Q3. As a reminder, this ecosystem includes ISVs that integrate DocuSign into their own solutions, systems integrators that build practices around the Agreement Cloud, and resellers to drive sales reach for us globally.  We continue to see overall traction with our more than 350 ISV integrations, including those announced in Q3 with Slack and with Workplace from Facebook. These follow a familiar pattern for us to make DocuSign available wherever business gets done. And with our recent momentum, we continue to see new partners join our ecosystem at a healthy clip. There is also been increased interest from SIs looking to build out Agreement Cloud practices that attach to their existing Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Workday practices thereby embedding DocuSign even deeper into critical front- and back-office business processes.  Lastly, our resellers including the likes of Carahsoft, Ingram Micro, and Insight to name just a few are seeing heightened demand for DocuSign too helping to drive sales through that channel. A great proof point is that Salesforce, as part of its revenue cloud business will now resell DocuSign Gen for Salesforce CPQ+, a product that generates agreements for Salesforce.  This creates incredible scale and reach, and typically leads to customers looking to DocuSign for broader agreement automation and CLM initiatives.  So, to wrap up my comments today, this is the third quarter in a row that we had these significant levels of growth. This acceleration in demand is laying the foundation for future expansion across the Agreement Cloud. And while substantial global, social, and economic challenges undoubtedly remain, we believe we are still just scratching the surface of our long-term opportunity. Before handing it over to Cynthia to walk you through our Q3 results in more detail, I want to share one other great piece of news. Cain Hayes, the CEO of Gateway Health has joined our Board of Directors. I am thrilled to have Cain providing strategic counsel to DocuSign and to me, especially given his track record in financial services and healthcare, two of our largest verticals.  So that is from me. Cynthia, over to you. Yes, Sterling, I think the way to think about this is it's a little bit of all of the above, first off right. And if you think about our model which is a capacity model, so it's not a \u2013 like an overage model where you see in some businesses. So people are buying capacity, and oftentimes it happens just as you articulated people will come back and they say, \u201cyou know we've used up our capacity and we need to renew,\u201d or sometime before they get to that point they've used up the volume level that they've sort of contracted with us to use, and they need to sort of true that up early, and we'll work with them to do an early renewal. And I think what we are seeing right now more than ever is that because people are putting more and more existing customers of their business processes on with DocuSign, they are more rapidly getting to a place where they've used up that capacity. They might have planned it as a three-year growth, and at the end of the year and a half or two, they are not at that new level, so they are coming back to us saying we want to renew and up the volume. Some people do buy by seats, as you said. Most people buy by a message capacity when we are talking about our eSignature business, which of course is still the largest part of our business. But even if someone does buy on a seat basis, we have a reasonable use per seat. So in the end and the right way to think about the business is, it is messaging volume. It is the capacity of agreements they are putting through the system, it is what drives that increase in demand which then leads them to up the contract with us. So that's kind of what's happening and my sense about it is, it's really the faster adoption that's driving this, that's coming from people putting more and more of their use cases on to DocuSign. Let me give you a sense of the arc we've had, Stan, over the last year. If you recall when we finished Q4 last year, the message we had was there was a fairly significant acceleration in particularly CLM, which was the major additional Agreement Cloud product we had at that time, and we were quite excited to see that coming into the New Year. And at the beginning of Q1, we saw that trend continuing. After COVID sort of hit and half way through our first quarter, we saw a fairly significant change. We saw customers coming back to us saying, yes, long-term, we want to be Agreement Cloud companies. But right now, we've got some critical use cases that we need to get out for signature, and so we saw this dramatic acceleration on the signature side of the business and some slowing of deals and some slowing of those transactions of people who are working with us on the CLM side. I think we've seen the same thing throughout the year. And in the last quarter or so, though we started to see that coming back. So, things like the Seal Software, things like CLM, those are now businesses that are returning to the levels we would have expected if they hadn't been for COVID. And we think CIOs and other business leaders fundamentally had a reaction upfront, which was I can only work on my critical projects. Remember, they were just like DocuSign having to go to a work from home setting and they weren't in their offices. And so, larger and more complex projects that require a systems integrator or at least some sort of statement of work. Those got pushed out a little bit. Now people are coming back and saying those are critical to our future, and so the Agreement Cloud is right back where we want it to be in terms of top of mind with our customers. And I'll just give you quick example. I had a call this morning with a very large customer of ours, and they said, \u201cHey, we are super excited to be now reaccelerating our plans to roll out CLM,\u201d while they have been dramatically increasing their signature usage over the course of the year. They said,\u201dNow is the time. We are ready to reaccelerate with CLM.\u201d And I think that's what we are going to see throughout the next few quarters. Well, I think there is a couple thoughts I have and then Cynthia chime in with your perspectives on what you are seeing. The first piece is, remember it's a much smaller number. So, we expect international to grow faster coming off a smaller base, but we also expect it to grow faster, because we have more levers there relative to the U.S. business in that we have additional countries that we are not in, and we have countries that we are very early in that we see an opportunity to really accelerate. That's I think what you saw in this last quarter is that a lot of the execution efforts we've been putting in place over the last several quarters have really come out very nicely in this quarter and popping up to 20%, which is a really important milestone for us. So I still see that happen. I think you are going to see more of the same. You are going to see us doing more in our non-focus eight countries to the newer ones that we'll be entering primarily using digital as an opportunity to get there in the really efficient way and then in the existing core eight, I think you are going to see an opportunity for us to this U.S. and the other seven to really leverage the investments we've made in people and processes investing ahead of that big opportunity for both countries that are substantial as already like you might see in a place like the UK or Canada or earlier like Germany and Japan, we see opportunities for both of those. So, I think you are going to see a really exciting opportunity to continue growth there. Sure. And might we had Cynthia chat a little bit about sort of the timing particularly in Q3 and how we saw that play out versus Q4, and going forward, before that let me just give you sort of a high-level perspective. They way I would think about it is TAM based. So, I would start off and say, just talk about signature for a second. When we talk about the sort of $25 billion TAM, that was the same number we've been using since the IPO and we continue to see that as a really good metric. We are seeing the opportunity. So, as fast as we are penetrating against that TAM, I think it's growing as fast. We are still in very early inning. And then when we are opening up the rest of the Agreement Cloud TAM, which is in the order of magnitude of almost doubling that, then we think to ourselves, we are actually not even keeping up with the TAM opportunity which is a high-class problem to have. And so, my view on it is that we've seen is not so much a pulling forward of demand that therefore now won't happen in the future. But that when we are looking at the long game of all of that market opportunity to penetrate, we are just executing at a higher rate today. And so we've accelerated that growth, not because we are sort of robbing from the future, but we are just getting closer towards that $25 billion TAM opportunity and with our revenue being under a couple billion and us having such a dramatic market share lead has been such a big portion of the total market. It gives you a sense that I think we can continue to grow at very attractive rates well into the future. Yes. It's a great way to think about it. And I think the way we have traditionally thought about the first phase of AI was things like the Analyzer product that I described earlier. We said this now gives our legal and business teams the ability to very quickly and efficiently understand where there are sort of outlier clauses or things they should pay particular attention to. But I actually think the most exciting part of that AI is where you are going with your question, which is once we have through a CLM that's enhanced with our AI capabilities, now companies have the ability to really learn about their business and make intelligent insights about their business based on that body of contracts that they have. And one of my favorite examples is that we see certain institutions saying, I want to understand my risk better, by understanding whether or not I have a whole bunch of contracts that are relevant to a particular sort of cost or something as an example we see this with companies in the chemicals industry to say, oil prices are hugely important to my business cause a variety of contracts have had a way to look across all of them and be thoughtful about what the puts and takes on that, so I can understand the risk and implication to my business by a move in that commodity price. So that's where I think the really exciting piece comes. And I think you are right, I don't think we've sort of looked at that in our existing TAM, because I don't think anyone has really built that market to help people do that analysis across all their agreements. And so, I think it is a part of our exciting future. I think it's a really interesting question. When we look at it from a vertical standpoint first, as we've mentioned before, some of our strongest verticals and that would include financial services, both banking and insurance, that include healthcare life sciences, increasingly government is one we've had a lot of enthusiasm about this year, as well. They've actually performed incredibly well in this time period for us.  Some of the verticals that weren't as big for us that you would expect to have been hurt of course were, we saw that some small businesses, we definitely saw that travel and hospitality that where people had to sort of put on hold virtually everything as they really new to the trench. So, when you think about it going forward, I don't expect there could be a significant rotation out of our strong industries and the verticals, again, then we talk about financial services, we talk about healthcare life sciences, I think they are going to be very strong for us next year, as well.  The government strength we saw this year, I think, we expect to continue into the year as well. Whether there will be some bounce back with some of the things like travel and hospitality that we are hurt, I mean some energy businesses, as well, I think the answer is, probably. But I don't know what that cycle time is, I don't know whether in the first quarter or second quarter or maybe it's a couple quarters post back, I am not sure how that plays out exactly.  But I don't think that will be a significant driver as the second piece you talked about. And so, as Cynthia just alluded to this in her comment, but if you talk about we've been adding such a significant number of new customers on the direct side of our business, 14,000 this quarter. It was 10,000 in each of Q1 and Q2. Those are primarily people coming in with eSignature only, because they need it to get those use cases up and running to get a really important priority for their business in this really challenging time.  Those are companies that we are going to aggressively be working a year from now to come back and say, hey, we want to talk to you in your renewal discussions around what additional use cases we have for signature. But also, I must tell you little more about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud and how that's going to transform your business in a way you might not even have thought about when you became a signature customer.  So that's the place where I think we'll see a bigger opportunity to really maintain substantial growth as Cynthia described. Yes. It's a super \u2013 super interesting, as you said, big picture question. So, when everyone gets newly introduced to DocuSign, I'll put myself in that category. Four years ago, one of the exciting things is thinking about all the possible places you can take this business and some because of the power of the data that was referred to earlier, but also the network effect that you are sort of describing in what could be a marketplace environment. So, let me really clear. We are a software company. We sell software to companies that use it to run their business. If their customers, their customers' data, we don't really think about that as information that's ours to sort of play with. So, that said, we do believe there are probably interesting opportunities where our customers over time could get comfortable with us say, hey, we want to monetize some of what's happened here in a different way. But I don't want to give you the sense that that's like a priority for us today. We look at the core business we had and we look again it has very large TAM. We need to execute for the next several years to achieve our goals of getting to $5 billion of revenue. And then after that, we are going to be talking about $10 billion in revenue. That's all going to be very achievable based on our current business model. So it's not that we are not interesting people here with interesting ideas about the expansion opportunities you are describing. I just want to be clear that's not part of the core business today. We are a software company. We serve our customers when they buy software from us. That will be, I believe the primary thing we do for the years to come. Any day now. Any day now. Yes, it's still pretty early in that journey. We are at a position right now where if you look at our financials, it's going to be a while before I believe the non-signature part of our business will be meaningful enough to sort of warrant that kind of break out. And when we done acquisitions like, what we did with Spring on the CLM side and what we did with Seal, we sort of shared what kind of the revenue was in those businesses. And if you recall, they are very, very small relative to a business that's passed the $1 billion last year and before long we'll be hitting $2 billion. So those are just really, really small at this point in time. The challenge is, initially I thought it would be sooner when we be having that conversation, but the reality is, is if this reacceleration of signature that's occurred this year, I mean, we started off, I'd be really clear, we started every conversation with a customer today saying, we want to talk to you about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. That's every new customer, as well as each customer we come into talk about renewals. But we've also this year more than ever, and we've finished that sort of explanation or articulation of the power of that Agreement Cloud vision. Most of them this year have said, that's fantastic and I look forward to doing that, but I need some signature today. And as I tell our sales people, there is only one answer to that question, which is, yes ma'am or yes sir, we've got signature for you today. And so, I think you are going to see that, that is going to be the reality of the next I would say several quarters, we are still seeing this demand as just so strong on signature. And it's almost hard for the folks that are CLM focused or Seal focused to sort of get attention to keep up with that rate. So, Cynthia, you can give a perspective on your thoughts on when we'd be in a position to talk about that further. But I just don't think we can really quantify it yet, because it's still so small. Yes, I can tell you, the deals that we have coming in have had a higher focus on signature in the last few quarters and as I mentioned before, we saw that that was growing for these rest of the Agreement Cloud going up to Q4 of last year and into the beginning of Q1 this year and then Signature has just been explosive for all the good reasons we've already talked about. And so, as I stated there is an increase in that mix in that direction. But I would say, the rest of the green side that have been holding it just hasn't been growing its share the way it had been growing substantially, again off of very, very small base, but growing its position there. And then from a standpoint of the channels, we've been investing a lot in the digital channel versus the direct sales channel. It's still about 15% of our revenue, plus almost 90% of our customers and I think that, we've seen real strength there. And I think, we are going to continue to see strength and you are going to see us talking in the future about the investments we want to make to move even more and more of our customer in new acquisitions to come through the digital business, which we think is going to be a super cost-effective way for us to scale our growth. Yes, I think, we've been very specific about what we've tried to do with our M&A strategy, which is to say, we are not looking from a strategy standpoint for sort of blockbuster deals in terms of buy lots of revenue per se. We've been trying to stick to our strategy that we think our customers want us to drive which is the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. So, when we do acquisitions, like you think about the three deals we've done since I've been here, you'll see they all have very similar characteristics, which is someone has a product, probably not super mature business, but are products that we look at and say, we need to have that functionality in our Agreement Cloud suite and we could build it on our own, but we think that they have some domain expertise. We think that it built a little bit of a business there. They've sort of got a market fit that we are \u2013 a product market fit that we are comfortable with. And we think it will accelerate our ability to build out those products and services for our customers. I think we'll probably be looking at doing the same thing.  So in terms of the valuation question, I am certain that the issue we already have today when we acquire a company, and they look at us and they go, we love you to buy us at the same multiple that DocuSign has. I don't think that's going to change and I'll start with that position and politely I'll probably remind them that we've achieved some things in our business as they probably haven't yet in terms of scale, growth and profitability. And therefore we might not \u2013 as we have not yet come close to giving some on the same multiple that we have. But I don't think other deals like Slack deal will fundamentally change the perspective of valuations and just my view on it is, they paid a slight premium to the peak multiple that Slack had. And that to me is sort of more of the same as opposed to sort of earth shattering multiple. But I think it is obviously clear that for entrepreneurs out there with that business is it probably makes them smile. So, I put it in three buckets, and I'll do them in priority order for you since you are asking about top, but it's kind of hard not to think about them all three, Pat, for me. The first one is, this sort of integration of the AI capability that we had \u2013 we purchased with Seal and Analyzer is the first example that's fantastic. But there is a ton more where we take that AI capability and bring it into our overall product suite, so we have a huge focus on integrating that team and integrating that technology, we think it's going to be as we talked about on earlier questions, hugely important part of building this significant opportunity that we have.  Second piece is, Notary. I think we look at this Notary and a lot of people think of it is a - as a smaller thing. We think it can actually be really significant. There is third-party Notary. There is going to be first-party Notary that we are attacking first, but we think that opportunity there is a very specific thing that we are aggressively going after and then we think about that as being part of our sign business, as opposed to really a separate component. But clearly, it's an additional growth opportunity for us on the sign side.  And then the third piece for me is, it really is about this macro opportunity of the Agreement Cloud and making sure we are stitching together all of the pieces that one thing as we buy these other companies sometimes they are small, they don't have our kind of uptime capability. They don't have the quality of service that we have and they are not integrated completely to using partners that we sort of jointly sold before. We have APIs, but we haven't really fully integrated them into a one platform. And so, I think getting that platform, the place where we want it to be will be the third of those important development priority. Yes. And I think your question about the implication going forward, I think the first implication is just what you said is that our customers are saying they want to do more DocuSign. They want to use this in different ways. And I think we continue to see that both within the signature business and Cynthia was describing, but also customers saying they want to expand into that for the Agreement Cloud, which also gives us another way to turbo charge that number. At the same time, I think as we go forward, we are not at this point changing our historic change that we talked about since the time of the IPO of saying that's going to be kind of in that piece, 112, 113 on the low end and to get up to a 119 or so on the high end. But let's get through this year, get through Q4 and see if then maybe want to reassess that because there are some puts and takes. There are some adjustments. We do think about the potential for churn. We don't have this as long as the pandemic is going to last and I have a lot of enthusiasm about a vaccine. But I think that's going to, in the next quarter or two, have a significant impact on the economy and we do worry about small businesses. So I think we just want to give us another quarter and then if we are going to take a hard look at that, and assess whether the success we've had would lead us to increasing our expectation for that range going forward and I agree with you it's somewhat unusual to see an accelerating rate there. But I think we are somewhat unusual as a company again that we have such a strong market leadership position and such a large TAM that I think is conceivable that we could continue to see that kind of acceleration. Yes. Interesting there has not been a lot of variation on that front. So the sizes of lands, the pricing of the deals what we've been doing, they've been then amazingly consistent even though the volume as you point out has been more substantial. There has been a small amount of mix shift, I talked about the direct business being very strong for us. But we've also seen those web upgrades that we talked about where we call that positive churn. Someone comes to us on the digital business and they get \u2013 they start growing with us and we create a direct relationship with them with the sales person being involved. And so, that's been accelerating and taking a bigger part of our business sort of pulling them out of the digital business if you will. So, it's nothing I'd point you, Taylor, that sort of seems to me fundamentally different that would give us any reason to expect that the journey, the customers would take in terms of their growth coming from that land and expand would be different. And then, to get to the second part of your question, what would that implication for the retention rate will be, it maybe some \u2013 a mass piece that over my head that I am missing. But I would expect it probably then to not have a significant impact on the retention rate if there was nothing different in the nature of those lands. So, but my guess, would be, but I give you a little more thought, I guess, we wouldn't see any change in that path that customers that average path, customers are taking with us for this new crop of new customers that are coming in even though they are bigger class, I think \u2013 we think they would probably perform the same way previous classes had as well. Yes. So it's great question. In fact, Forrester did couple years ago put out a report saying we already had become a brand. I think that same way you talked about like CleanX or Xerox. So, Koji, we are a step ahead. We already got that piece done in the U.S. as you indicated. We just actually recently did a study couple months ago and Rob Giglio, our CMO looked at our brand in a variety of different markets and what we found is that the aided awareness was quite strong. But the unaided awareness was not as strong as it might be and clearly not as is in the U.S. and the fundamental difference is that, in the U.S. recall that we took a very significant position within the real estate space and so many people when buying homes or leasing apartments got familiar with using DocuSign. So it's at a point that, if I go some places I work at DocuSign the vast, vast majority of the people get what we call Docu love story and they come back and tell, gosh, I was traveling on a vacation, and was able to buy a home or I started a new job and I was able to sign that when I was traveling and all those wonderful stories that you and I talked about that happens with our brand. If you are in different markets overseas, particularly some of the markets where we have had sort of less growth and I'd put sort of the Germanys and Japans as an example if we don't have that same brand awareness. It's starting to happen and we are going to be looking in the coming years to invest in different ways to build that greater brand awareness because the real estate market won't be the same. It's just very different in the U.S. than it is most other countries. It won't give us that same vehicle to do it. We are looking at focusing on our digital business and using digital advertising, which of course is customer acquisition-oriented. But we'll also have a component of brand building for us. So that's going to be a big part of our marketing plan in the coming year. And I will look forward to at some point during the year, given the opportunity to share with you all what we are seeing in terms of success of those investments. But the last thing I would tell you is, even though we, in some of these countries do not have the same sort of leadership position of our brand, nobody else does either. So when we get to those other markets, there is no other DocuSign of with that same sort of presence in another country. So we haven't lost that opportunity to take that global leadership position in each of the key international markets where want to be and that's what we intend to do just that. Yes. The IO4 is actually built and it's operational and we've actually put volume through it. There is additional an organization called DIFA more than probably everyone know in the Federal government has a final certification requirement that we expect shortly. But we are already working with agencies on that functionality and capability and we are excited about it the same way when we got Fed ramp certification. We continue to put ourselves in a position with the Federal government, and by the way it does trickle down a lot of states really look at that as being important even if they don't necessarily require the certification, it gives them comfort. So we see that in local and state governments as well. And we think we feel really good about that positioning as the sort of preeminent provider in the agreement space to the agencies. So, from a standpoint \u2013 when you said \u201821, I assume you meant calendar \u201821 not fiscal '21 and we actually think fiscal '21 this past year has actually been, I don't think a lot of inflection point, but incredibly strong for us in government and so many agencies now have requirements to do things, particularly around eSignature with a company like DocuSign. So, we expect that to continue to be a strength. I think we are looking at different ways that we can invest in sort of the marketing to be more effective and getting the breadth of our message out to all the different particularly Federal agencies. And I think, well, I think we've done good sales execution. I would say that we have an opportunity to a better job on sort of marketing and business development aspects at sort of the top side of that funnel with the various government agencies. And so, we will look at that in fiscal '22, calendar '21 to accelerate that to do even more. Thank you, Koji. Yes. So let me tell what I know and what I don't know. What I know is what Cynthia just reported to you which we had some that I can say for the last three quarters, the highest rate of billings growth we've ever had in our history and didn't think that what happened this quarter after last quarter and it did given the compare in Q4, as you see the guide, I don't think we would say we expect that to happen again by any means next quarter. But the growth has been very strong and has been consistent. So the tricky part to your question is in the post-pandemic, I have no idea when that's coming and anymore than anything other people on this call, my sense is that, it has been accelerant to our business. So there would be some lack of that accelerant in the \u2013 occurring in a post-pandemic world. But at the same time I think the second part of your question which is really important is, we are also hitting our stride with the capabilities we have in the rest of the Agreement Cloud. And we've also built a lot of sales capacity right as we've seen this opportunity and because the TAM is so big, I think the biggest determinant of our ability to grow is our ability to onboard quality people that can build the software that we need and then represent and sell that software into the marketplace so we can then work with that customers success to drive adoption. So, if we can continue to scale our team effectively, I think we can continue to grow at very exciting rates. So I think that's kind of how I look at it right now. And I do think it's going to be a little while before we realize what the new normal will be and what we said the last couple of quarters but I still think is what we say it today is that, at some point, the sort of enormity of the tailwind that is there will be less enormous, but it may be substantial that people have said digital transformation is what I need now and they flip the bet and we will continue to see strong growth of that. But my assumption not really having any detailed ability to guess the future is that that growth will be at a higher rate than we were at pre-COVID happening, but probably not at the same growth rate that we've seen in the last few quarters where it's been amazingly heightened. So, I think it will be very strong growth and probably higher than you've seen previously. And so when we look at our revenue growth I think you'll see next quarter when Cynthia pulls together. I think what you will see is an exciting growth future for us and probably from a billing standpoint, slightly below the incredible numbers we've put up the last few quarters. So, you are saying the Insight as a partner. Yes, absolutely, sorry, I got confused on the partner side. Yes, so, I would say that, we think it's a significant part and one of the things that's interesting when you think about our partners, and this happened before we did the CLM acquisition of Spring CM where people previously had said, yes we love DocuSign, customers love DocuSign, but software is pretty good. It's pretty easy to implement and there is not really an opportunity for us to make enough money in sort of implementing it. Then with Spring, we saw people say, hey, you are getting into a broader base software tool that requires a significantly SOW to be installed and there is real opportunity. And we saw the SI community sort of work with us more aggressively to become partners and we see that happening more so, because of Insight. And I think people realize there is a lot of opportunity to deliver fantastic value for our end joint customers if they are providing services. So, I one of you have heard us talk about is we are actually trying to decrease even though it's a small \u2013 I am talking about 4% of our revenue being services, decreasing that as a percentage going forward not because we are going to reduce the service as we do, but we are just going to move so much more at the growth into the partner ecosystem. So that's kind of how we look at that. We think it's going to be a significant piece with a lot of excitement about partners and particularly SIs that want to leverage Insight into the work they do with our joint customers. Yes, that's really thoughtful question. So, first off the danger is, I look at my dataset of the customers I've spoken with. We got 34,000 new direct customers in the first nine months. I didn't talk to too many of them myself. But I would tell you from a trend standpoint I haven't seen something that feels fundamentally different. So I don't think we are landing higher or landing lower for that matter. I think our enterprise business has done really well. So it's probably \u2013 maybe - might be a little mix shift from that standpoint to growth there in more senior relationships. But I can tell you this that we do not have field personnel that do not start now every conversation with the Agreement Cloud. And as I mentioned earlier, just we don't let someone go out and even if get in RFP in or someone calls up and just says, give me signature right now, you are going to listen to a DocuSign Agreement Cloud pitch I mean it's going to talk to you of how you are going to prepare, sign, act on and manage your agreements with DocuSign. And that wouldn't have been true a year ago. We wouldn't had that in the field enabled to do that. So we are actually doing that. So, my guess is that, anything that's probably a slight, slight move towards people who are coming in whether they are more senior or not, but they are coming in with a mindset that this is an Agreement Cloud company and this is where they should be going with us and that's why I first see is probably the trend moving in the future. Thank you. Thank you so much, operator. Hey, thank you guys for joining us. As Annie said, we are going to be up on the road some opportunity to see you all. We are obviously incredibly excited about the business and the performance we have. And we'll look forward to seeing you all in the near future. Cheers."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call for fiscal 2021. I appreciate everyone joining us today and I would like to cover four key areas of the business with you. The evolution of COVID-19 and the impact we are seeing on our business, the essential role that eSignature and the Agreement Cloud continue to play in the digital transformation of our customer\u2019s businesses around the world, our recent acquisition to accelerate the opportunity in remote on-line notary and a few additions to the Board and executive team, including Mike Sheridan's new international leadership role. So let\u2019s start with the evolving dynamics of the pandemic. It would be an understatement to say that we\u2019re all still experiencing significant changes in the way that we work and live as a result of COVID-19. We\u2019re seeing it with our more than 5000 employees around the world as we don\u2019t expect to return to an office environment until June of next year. As a team, we\u2019re focused on helping each other adapt to these changing circumstances and to balance the myriad demands on our collective time. We\u2019re seeing it with our customers too. I spoke last quarter about how so many of them faced a sudden need to transition to remote work when the pandemic first hit. Today, that need has evolved from an initial crisis response to a business necessity. And because Agreements are central to doing business, the need to agree electronically and remotely has never been stronger. This is causing greater adoption of our offerings, something we believe will persist beyond the crisis, because in our experience it\u2019s very rare to see anyone go back to paper once they\u2019ve gone digital. The upside of all this is that DocuSign is becoming an increasingly essential Cloud Software Platform for organizations of all types of sizes, a fact that is well reflected in our Q2 results. Billings grew 61% year-over-year to $406 million and revenue grew 45% to $342 million. We added more than 88,000 new customers bringing our total to nearly three quarters of a million worldwide. For perspective, we acquired more new customers in the first half of this year than we did in all of last year. Our operating margins and cash flows reached record levels, while we continued to make key investments to address the heightened demand. As is evident from these numbers the trends that emerged in the latter half of Q1 have continued throughout Q2. We\u2019ve seen a sustained rise in demand for our core eSignature offering not only from new customers but also those expanding across used cases, departments and board rooms. The interest in transforming other parts of the agreement process is growing too, and that in turn creates pipeline for the rest of the agreement cloud suite. Now let me give you some examples of recent customer wins and expansion. One of our largest retail customers runs a network of healthcare clinics within its stores. When COVID-19 hit the company accelerated plans to provide tele health services, using DocuSign eSignature to handle consent and other paperwork remotely. This is a great example of COVID accelerated demand that we see as durable. Now telehealth will remain after COVID-19 but the paperless processes that came with it will likely end up getting implemented for in person clinic visits too, because the electronic way is more efficient and a better experience than paper and clipboards. Another example is from a large financial institution that\u2019s a long-time DocuSign customer. The Company already used eSignature widely, but when COVID-19 hit, it accelerated plans for further rollouts and together we helped activate 11 new lines of business. This illustrates the pattern we\u2019re seeing where established customers are now bringing eSignature to new divisions, departments and regions. This was going to happen at some point, but it\u2019s just happening faster now. Finally, I have a few examples from an area of the economy I know you are all interested in, the public sector. To date, we held a strong competitive position for local, state and federal levels here in the United States. This quarter, we built on that base with a healthy mix of eSignature and multi product Agreement Cloud deals, including DocuSign CLM, and our identity family of products. We helped a major city deploy a digitized workflow, to handle applications for housing assistance, and we enabled the federal agency to capture applications and distribute relief funds to healthcare providers on the front lines of Coronavirus response. So, in summary, it was an exceptional quarter for customer growth and expansion. Economic headwinds did cause some to request relief, but that was more than offset by increased demand overall. And while DocuSign faces the same economic uncertainty as everyone else, we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver increasing and durable value, no matter where business is conducted. I'd like to move on now to how we're investing in innovation and new Agreement Cloud product offerings. Specifically, I'd like to talk about our acquisition in July of Liveoak Technologies, an Austin based start-up that was already a close partner of ours. For agreements that would normally require people to be together in person, Liveoak enables the transaction to be done remotely via video conferencing. The company's platform includes several other technologies specific to remote agreements too, such as video identity verification, collaborative form filling, and integration with DocuSign eSignature, and a detailed audit trail. With this acquisition, we will leverage Liveoak\u2019s technology to accelerate the launch of DocuSign notary, a solution for remote online notarization where signaries and the notary public are in different places. DocuSign Notary will do for notarization what eSignature did for signing. It will enable a dramatically better experience for everyone involved from wherever they may be. We believe this is a natural extension of our eSignature business. And once people use remote online notarization, we don't expect them to go back. In fact, when we announced this move, the customer response was very clearly how soon can I get it? And the answer is a DocuSign Notary is slated for beta release later this year. The initial version will be for existing customers that already have a notary capability within their organization, or what we call first party notary. And we expect to enable third party notaries in the near future. Now, before I close out my remarks, I wanted to share a few enhancements to our board and executive team. I'm thrilled to share that Theresa Briggs and James Beer have recently joined our Board of Directors. Theresa is assuming the role of Audit Committee Chair and she brings a wealth of financial experience from Deloitte as well as fantastic and relevant Board experience at ServiceNow and Snowflake. James has extensive financial experience as CFO at Atlassian today, previously at American Airlines, McKesson, and Symantec, all of which will be invaluable as we continue to scale our business. On the executive team, we have appointed Kamal Hathi as Chief Technology Officer reporting into Tom Casey. In this new role, Kamal will oversee the development and execution of our overall technology roadmap. Given his 20-plus year run at Microsoft, and his recent experience at Trader Interactive, we believe Kamal is the ideal person to build the platform that powers the Agreement Cloud as it continues to scale. I'm also excited to announce that I'm promoting Mike Sheridan to the role of President of International at DocuSign. And that Cynthia Gaylor, a current board member and audit committee chair will be joining as our new CFO. As you've heard me say in almost every call today, international business is a key growth driver for us, international growth with over 60% this quarter, and his contribution to our overall business is increasing. Since the beginning of this year, Mike has been spearheading our growth initiatives across EMEA. Given the strong results of his efforts there, we are now broadening his scope to drive growth across all international markets. So I couldn't be more pleased for Mike and for DocuSign to be doubling down on international. Of course, we couldn't do this if we didn't have access to a CFO like Cynthia. She brings more than 25 years of finance and capital markets experience with an extensive background in strategy and operations as well a deep understanding of enterprise and consumer software. Most recently, she was the CFO of Pivotal Software, prior to which she led corporate development at Twitter, and was a Managing Director in the Morgan Stanley technology biz. I'm looking forward to working closely with Cynthia in an operating capacity as we continue to drive the business forward. As Mike and I worked through the scope of his new role over the past few months, we also collaborated with Cynthia so she could hit the ground running. She will continue to partner closely with Mike and myself over the next several months to ensure a strong and seamless transition. So with that, I'd like to welcome Cynthia to the team and to again congratulate Mike on his new role. I'll close this out by saying that the catalysts for further digital transformation remain strong. And we firmly believe DocuSign can continue to deliver value across the entire agreement cycle. And our strong Q2 combined with the momentum we're seeing as we enter Q3 gives us confidence in the business. While the pandemic continues to have an unpredictable effect on the market at large, we will stay nimble and will continue to do everything we can to help our customers, partners and employees adapt, transform, and move forward. Now, let me turn it over to Mike for a deeper dive on the financials and some comments on his new role. Mike?\nMike Sheridan: Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into my comments on the corner quarter, I'd like to thank Dan and the board for entrusting me with my new role as President of International. We have a great strength in our international operations today, has achieved impressive growth over the last several years. I look forward to working with this great team to expand upon the success. I also want to welcome and congratulate Cynthia Gaylor as our new CFO. As Dan mentioned, he and I have had the opportunity over the last couple of years to work with Cynthia as a board member. And during that time, she has become very familiar with DocuSign\u2019s financial operations. I am confident that Cynthia will hit the ground running as she joins the team. Turning to our Q2 results, strong sales led by our eSignature solutions were over 61% year-over-year increase in billings to $406 million. This also drove a 45% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $342 million in the second quarter. Subscription revenue increased 47% year-over-year to $324 million. We saw particular strength outside the U.S. as total International revenue grew over 59% year-over-year to $67 million. This quarter, we added over 88,000 new customers, of those, over 10,000 were direct customers, an increase of 55% year-over-year. This brings our total customer base to nearly 749,000 worldwide with over 99,000 direct customers. Strong eSignature expansions and upsells into our existing customer base led to a record dollar net retention rate of 120% in the quarter. Customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 41% year-over-year, to a total of 520 customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 78%, consistent with a year ago. Subscription gross margin was 83% compared with 84% a year ago. Margins were impacted by our Seal acquisition as well as by investments we made in our data center capacity, particularly for hosted services to ensure our ability to meet significantly higher transaction volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $233 million, or 68% of total revenue in the quarter, compared with $185 million, or 78% of total revenue in Q2 last year. We generated $34 million in non-GAAP operating profit or a 10% operating margin in the quarter. This compares with an operating loss of less than $1 million in the second quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income was $35 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2 million in the second quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 5008 employees, an increase of 44% over the second quarter of last year, second [ph] quarter increased nearly 350% year-over-year to $118 million compared with $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $100 million in the quarter compared with $12 million a year ago. CapEx increased during the quarter due to leasehold improvements in Brazil, as well as the completion of our federal data center. Now, let me turn to guidance. We anticipate total revenue of $358 million to $362 million in Q3, and $1.384 billion to $1.388 billion for fiscal 2021. Of this total, we expect subscription revenue of $343 million to $347 million in Q3, and $1.315 billion to $1.319 billion for fiscal 2021. For Billings, we expect $380 million to $390 million in Q3, and $1.623 billion to $1.643 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q3 and fiscal 2021. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 46% to 48% of revenues for Q3, and 45% to 47% for fiscal 2021. R&D in the range of 14% to 16%, for Q3 and for fiscal 2021. And finally, G&A in the range of 9% to 11%, for Q3 and for fiscal 2021. For Non-GAAP interest and other we expect $1 million of expense to $1 million of income and for fiscal 2021 we expect for $4 million to $6 million of non-GAAP interest and non-operating income. We expect the tax provision of approximately $2 million to $3 million for Q3, and $7 million to $9 million for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 200 to 205 million shares for Q3 and fiscal 2021. Thanks for joining us today, and we will now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. First, Mike, congratulations on the promotion and running International. If Cynthia's there, congratulations on the new role as CFO. Just on the idea of International Mike, maybe you can give us an update on the status of where the go-to-market, the percentage of revenue coming from International and what investments are necessary to drive that business going forward?\nMike Sheridan: Yes, thanks Sterling. A couple of things. I would say that if you look at the scale of International today, it's over $200 million in revenue. And the team is executing very well. I just reported a 59% year-over-year increase in revenues. So there's definitely growth already being achieved. If you think about that scale, it's similar to what DocuSign was about five years ago when I joined DocuSign. At that time, DocuSign was also a very rapidly growing organization. So as we've looked at many of the challenges that we needed to deal with at that stage of the total company, are showing themselves in our International region. So much of the work that I'm going to be doing is going to look a lot like the work that we've been working on over the last several years as we scale the whole business. I think what really makes this work is in my role as CFO, I've worked on so many of the very same kinds of issues. I've developed strong relationships with the executive staff in headquarters, as well as the leaders across the globe. So we have a lot of foundation in terms of what the nature of the investments are going to be. I think we're tracking well. I think a lot of what we're seeing is that the structure of our International operations today look like what they were when we formed them, four or five, six years ago, which is direct line reporting into headquarters, which is appropriate. But I think what I can bring is a greater focus into that area where I can work with the executive members as well as the regional leaders to figure out how they work together across those reporting lines to figure out what are the right in region investments and structures that that can drive that growth further?\nSterling Auty: Right. And then one quick follow up in terms of the gross margin, specifically subscription gross margin, comments on kind of where we are in the scale. And what we should expect trend wise from that line going forward?\nMike Sheridan: Yes, so the guidance that I provided shows that they're going to, for the, for the period of time to the end of this fiscal year stay in those high 70s to low 80 kind of range. There was one impact in Q2 that related to our acquisition of Seal, which had an impact on the margin that was slightly dilutive as we anticipated. The other impact on margins right now is that as I mentioned, we have pretty significant increases in our transaction volumes. And so we're continuing to build out our infrastructure, data center infrastructure and other to ensure that we kind of keep our SLAs tracking as we're, as we're consuming those greater transaction volumes. So we're absorbing those into the existing margins, but I think they're going to be stable at that level to the end of the fiscal year.\nSterling Auty: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. From my end, the thing that I wanted to dig into is, what are you seeing as far as the pull through of the rest of the DocuSign suite with into your existing installed base of eSignature customers, so things like you know your SpringCM CLM product, Seal and then I have a quick follow up.\nDan Springer: Yes. So, Stan, I think what we're seeing is sort of what we talked about last quarter, continue the dramatic pull from our customers and prospects for eSignature with a very high, you know, enablement time, very quick ROI, and just the need for people to take that first step into the Agreement Cloud. And as most people do enter into Agreement Cloud is to eSignature. That's been the -- that's the headline story. And if we look at our growth, it's been more significant in the traditional aspects of our business than any other part. And we're very clear, when we go to our field, we say that you have to when you talk to customers and you talk to prospects, you start off every conversation with DocuSign Agreement Cloud Company, let me tell you how we're going to help you prepare, sign, act on and manage your agreement. And if that individual says to you, yes, I\u2019d like to buy some eSignature to get started right now, the only appropriate answer is yes sir, or yes ma'am. I'm happy to sell you some eSignature. And that's what we're going to continue to do through this period of time. We want to really support what the customers are needing. But at the same time, as I mentioned up front, we're seeing a lot of people saying the concept of the Agreement Cloud is really something they're embracing. And they're saying we'd love to figure out a way to broaden the relationship with DocuSign. We believe that things like DocuSign CLM, which is the with the SpringCM product, we've turned it into here, will continue to be strong, we see a lot of demand, we're building a lot of pipe for it. And the customers that we're bringing in right now, 88,000, new customers, many of those will be prospects for CLM in the future. But we believe that the sales cycle there will always be a little bit longer, they're more complex. Usually there's a services component, right? So it has to be a statement of work calculated and done. And a lot of times I think we're seeing CIOs and CFOs at our customers today are saying I want to do that. But right now I need to get these signature pieces enabled. Let's do that now and as we get later into the year and more settled and settle down in their company is where I think we'll see increased demand and pull through of those other components.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. That makes a lot of sense. And maybe one for Mike. Mike, congratulations on the promotion to lead International. And just on the quarter, net revenue retention, obviously very impressive 120% result. How should we think about net revenue retention moving forward versus your more traditional 112 to 119 range? That's it for me. Thank you.\nMike Sheridan: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes, we obviously for the last couple of quarters have been at the higher end of that range. Actually, this quarter, we exceeded it a little bit. I'm not going to update a guidance range for it. We will be upgrading that guidance range when we provide guidance for fiscal 2022. But with that said, I think what we've seen in these recent quarters in terms of growth strengthening around $1 net retention and our ability to upsell into our installed base should keep us on the higher half of that range.\nStan Zlotsky: All right, perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Alex Zukin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, congratulations all around, and the quarter and the promotions, etcetera. I guess maybe just two from me, first one for Dan. Dan, are trends, [we'll be talking about] [ph] trends on kind of a monthly basis and linearity both on kind of the mid-market at the enterprise. Do you feel like around even engagement are you -- are we past the kind of momentum and now you're starting to see more returns normal adoption or, or is it still - are trends still accelerating?\nDan Springer: So in terms of two things, one is, we have sort of a linearity and we do a lot of our forecasting. We've looked at how quarters build across the month. And the one thing I would tell you in the last couple of quarters, we've seen some I would call positive trend where we are having less of a back end, wait to our quarter. And I would say that, you'd expect that of course, to be on our web and mobile business, which tend to have relatively even linearity, right. Whereas an enterprise of course, it had the biggest back waiting in the quarter. But we're seeing it across the board, even with the enterprise, more evenness. I think some of that is execution on our part. I think we're putting a lot of focus on thinking about monthly closes versus just quarterly closes. But I would also tell you that I believe in the marketplace, we're just seeing demand being stronger, and so people are coming to us through all parts of the quarter, just trying to get deals done. So we're probably seeing some positivity there. But that's the -- I don't think there's been a dramatic change and I don't think we see anything in the way we're forecasting. Michael, if you see something different, feel free to share it. But, I think we're not seeing a lot of a lot of dramatic change, just a slight improvement in that, and that gives us more predictability as we look through the quarter.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And then maybe for Mike, you look at the billings growth of the first half is nothing short of extraordinary. I don't think anybody would kind of speak otherwise around that. The guidance for the second half does look like a pretty different type of growth trajectory. So I guess the obvious question is, is there any pull in activities that you saw around large enterprise deals and kind of this quarter in the first half, because I would assume that, you're now getting into your big enterprise renewal conversations in the second half and period, and that should actually, potentially drive even more, large deal conversations and be a net benefit, even more so for net expansion?\nMike Sheridan: Yes, so I would say a couple things out there. I think in Q3 our guidance has billings growth year-over-year well into the 40 percentile. So I do feel like, we're off to a good start in Q3 and it's reflected in the guidance like we've talked about in the past. There's a lot of variables Dan alluded to it in his comments that we're subject to like everybody else. We're trying to figure them out real time. We feel very good about the second half. We guide what we can see we don't we don't guess, we always aspire for the highest level of growth we can accomplish, but I think the guidance is reasonably balanced and positive.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Great, good afternoon, everybody. Wanted to drill down a little bit into the acquisitions. And I guess starting with Seal obviously; you've announced the big improvements to contract analytics and just wanted to know how far down the path you are at this point, how much raw R&D you're going to have to spend moving forward. And when, when it's going to kind of achieve your vision?\nDan Springer: Well, I think when we talked about Seal starting off, I think the answer is there was only two parts to this. And we're still excited about both. One was this sort of intelligent insights, which is I think the core agreement analytics products that we've been partnering, you know, with CLM when they were a partner before the acquisition. And we continue to see that's going to be something that a lot of our customers are going to want to do. And we're very excited about that. And then the second piece was about integrating the Seal AI technology into our CLM offering. So as you saw, when the Gartner report came out on CLM, we were the only two companies that were in that upper right hand quadrant and we feel we had a fantastic entry with DocuSign CLM. And yet, we also felt internally, the place where we had the biggest improvement opportunity was to really integrate agreement analytics into that CLM product. And so that is the Second big piece. So on the first one Intelligent Insights, I think we're there. And it was a product that was fairly, close to standalone, there's some things we needed to do to make it DocuSign quality, let's call that, in terms of things like security and reliability, and we're still making investments on that front. But I would say we say that that product is pretty much ready for primetime and our people are now out aggressively selling that into our base. In terms of the integration with CLM. That's something that's still quarters away. We still have a lot of engineering and R&D work as you referred to it to make that the fulfill that promise we have for our CLM product, where it's going very well. I think we're highly confident, but we think that will be early next year before I can really put my hand on my heart and tell you that work is complete. And the DocuSign CLM product has a fully integrated advanced agreement analytics functionality, one that will allow us to be significantly stronger than other players in the market.\nRob Owens: I guess quickly on the Liveoak acquisition, how much does that increment your TAM? And can you just speak to the broader opportunity there?\nDan Springer: Yes, yes. So TAM is actually a really interesting topic within the notary space. We've taken a couple looks at it, we've looked at other reports. We're basically saying, we think this approaches about a billion dollars. So if you look at this, and you think about it in the construct of a $25 billion, TAM for eSignature, it's not a dramatic increase. But it's a really nice piece. And the bigger side of it for us is, so many of our customers have said to us, we really would love to have a notary capability. And particularly for those larger customers that have what we call first party notary, they already have a notary capability in their business. They really are excited to integrate this into their offering. We see that a lot with the financial institutions who have been pushing us. So as much as anything, this is like a feature enhancement that we think we\u2019ll have a nice, billion bucks. That's not a bad increment to go after. But it's not it's not like sort of a earth shattering change in our business. We look at this as a really nice tuck-in that our customers are asking for. And this good piece for us to go after. And then, it opens the opportunity to go after the third party notary space. And we have 10 people tend to think about that the individual notaries that are driving around for people to do real estate transactions, and we would love to then really transform that business as well as so many customers have come to us and said in the past, that would be a great opportunity for DocuSign to make their lives a little more agreeable.\nRob Owens: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPat Walravens: Oh, great. Thank you. And congratulations, Mike. I love the move from the financial role to the operating role. That's awesome. So here's my question for you, Dan. And I've asked a bunch of CEOs this question this quarter, which is how do you make DocuSign, the best place to work when everybody is working from home?\nDan Springer: If I had the answer to that one, I would be selling it in a lot of different ways that for sure. But I can tell you this, the good news is because we had built such a such a strong culture and that's why our Glassdoor scores are so high, and we do so well on those, you know, Best Places to Work surveys, and why our own surveys our employee engagement so high is because we built a fantastic culture where people really believe in our values, and fundamentally, they're excited to work in a place that puts customer success as our top priority even above our financial results. And people get excited about the pride they have for working here. None of that has changed. Well, it's harder to have those personal connections to people, when we don't have people coming into the office. And each day that goes by a bigger percentage of DocuSign owners have never met personally, one of their colleagues. We're about to cross over $1,000 DocuSigners that have joined since we were doing remote office work. So it's going to get tougher and tougher. And I think the real answer is increased communications, we are looking at changing up the mix of communications. And some of the things are harder. But I'll tell you something else, some of the things are better. I'll just give you one example, Pat. So in the past, we have an event called discovering DocuSign, where we would invite people and they join shortly after the join to Seattle is where the company was founded. And we met with a bunch of other new DocuSigners. And we had different executives come in and talk to them about the company over a couple days. I didn't get to attend that very often, just because my schedule and what I need, I couldn't always be there. In fact, I started to be there less and less. Now that we do that as a remote event, I\u2019m there every time. So every new DocuSign employee could be a good thing or bad thing depending how you look at it Pat. But they get an opportunity to meet Dan Springer. And we get created, create a connection, and quite a few of them send me emails right afterwards. And we've now built a different kind of connection. So it's remote, but we're figuring out creative ways to find different communication styles and techniques to put us into a place where I think we can continue to this a place for people to do the work their lives. But it's ever -- this is not one that's going to over quickly. We're going to have to continue to be creative to do if we want to continue to earn that great relationship we have at our employees.\nPat Walravens: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Walter Pritchard with Citi .Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi. Couple of questions on the sales and marketing side. Your growth in spending there has been decelerating over the last three quarters. And understanding there's expenses like T&E and so forth are not part of that. How are -- what are you doing to build sales capacity over the next six months? And how do you think about driving sales once we get into the situation where maybe people here are on fire and COVID is at least, we work through it being more of a normalized situation as opposed to the situation we're in right now?\nDan Springer: Yes. So couple of things. I would say capacity, we are continuing to expand our capacity pretty aggressively. As you saw from the hiring statistics that I had mentioned. We're now over 5000 employees, year-over-year growth 44%, substantial amount of that is in our go-to-market organization, not just on sales capacity, of course marketing capacity as well and customer success capacity. And so, we are endeavoring to stay ahead of the trends that we're seeing. We're working to see the demand data very carefully to try to forecast trends and get ahead of that with capacity across the business. In terms of what will we anticipate post-COVID? I don't know that anybody have a great answer for that. It is our view that as we work through these difficult time so, there is a greater awareness of the need to digitize the business. And we believe that's going to be staying even after things returned to whatever normal look like in the future. So, we do believe that we're entering into a period of a \"new normal\". It doesn't necessarily mean that the highs of any particular quarter going to sustain forever. But at the same time, we don't see trends that things are going to return to the way they looked and trended pre-COVID. So we're designing the business. We're designing our marketing activities and our sales activities to stay on top of that as possible.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Koji Ikeda with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nKoji Ikeda: Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter guys. Congrats to Mike on your new role and congrats Cynthia on your new role too. Just one question from me. On the sales process, we're just thinking that now most of the role has been operating in this new pandemic environment for a while. Have your sales conversation changed significantly? Are you thinking customers taking a set back now and looking at how to optimized workflows more strategically, which could result in more platform type conversations for you? Or maybe even broader adoption across the organization, the starting point for implementing DocuSign?\nDan Springer: Yes. Koji, its really interesting question. One thing that's always hard in answering a question around sort of more kind of shifts like that is what's behind? Is it maturation of our business? Is it related to COVID etcetera? My view is from a COVID standpoint, as the nature of your question is we went through a period of time where people just got very focused six months ago on -- we need to get things up and going quickly. We need to work in a remote environment. And with certain use cases that we can't run our business, we can't figure them out. So it was not about that that naval gazing and deep thought about their processes. It\u2019s about getting some of these primarily eSignature workflows in place. And while I think there is still some of that for sure that has definitely calm down. And I think the number of people that are rushing to us saying, I need to make a quick adjustment to be able to deal with like this. They haven't got it done by now. And they miss that window. We are seeing now as people saying, wow, this is fantastic. There more place where I could leverage this in my business. And we're looking at expansion as we talked about of use cases within our base to more and more places that as I said before. We only think they would have gotten there eventually. It just accelerated those. And we're continuing to see that acceleration of those workflows into DocuSign, because they realized how beneficial they are to their business. From the standpoint to that more platform thinking, I don't know that I would say, I seen that increase and I don't know if I say this increase would be due to the COVID. The natural maturation for a lot of folks with us around the Agreement Cloud opportunity is as they start hearing us described this future. They say while I could see you as a more strategic part of my sort of IT infrastructure and my business process infrastructure. And so I think that's occurring more and more. But I think that's more to do with the fact that we're just getting bigger and having larger relationships with companies as we scale. You look at that number of customers above $300,000 which is just sort of one minute [ph] that keeps growing substantially. And so I think that's driving it more than a COVID reaction. But again, it's hard to sort of separate out each of those components. But that would be my view.\nKoji Ikeda: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Taylor McGinnis with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. And congrats again on a really strong quarter. So net retention rates have been really strong the last couple quarters. But I believe so far that's largely been driven by eSignature related expansions. So, I'm just curious what kind of levels you think net retention could hit one things like SpringCM or the broader Agreement Cloud start to become larger contributors? Or maybe anything that you can just share on what those deal expansions have look like so far, when they include those products relative to just eSignature?\nMike Sheridan: Hi, Taylor. Yes, couple of things. One, if you look at the scale of our eSignature business compared to the scale of the CLM, and the data analytics or agreements -- sorry, agreement analytics businesses, eSignature is dramatically larger. So that statistic is going to largely succeed or not succeed based upon our success in eSignature, our upsells or volume expansions and all of those things. That is not to say that the Agreement Cloud expansions are not important. They are. But that is a much longer term trajectory before you'll start to see them have a meaningful movement in a broader statistic like that. So as we talked about those businesses and how they're growing and the comments that Dan made, I think those are all critical. But in terms of the near term quarter-to-quarter impact on something like dollar net retention, eSignature volumes are just going to overwhelm it. So you won't see it so much statistic like that.\nTaylor McGinnis: Got it. That makes a ton of sense. And then my last question is, I thought the inflection in international growth was really interesting. So just curious if there was any catalysts in the demand environment there that drove that or if you guys made any changes on the go-to-market front? Or if there was any just -- if there was anything to call it in particular?\nDan Springer: I think Mike's involvement in international, Taylor; it's clearly been the driver in the increased growth there. And around the company, we couldn't be more excited that he's off to such a good start. From your sense about the market, and I think it's mostly Mike's execution. But for your sense about the market, I don't think we have seen anything different. We have seen different levels of success in different geographies. It was phenomenal for us to be able to say that every single geography that we have was above plan in the quarter. And we're in a bunch of geographies. So that's pretty impressive. I would tell you, there's some markets that I was going to point, to one that was particularly strong, I would say LATAM, and our Brazil team crushed it. But if I said to the area where I saw the most improvement, because we've been crushing it there for a while, I'd say was Europe. And I think, again, with tongue out of my cheek, I'll say, I do think, Mike, leadership in Europe has helped us perform a little better there and execute better. And it's big reason. We're so excited for this broader expansion of his role to all of international. But I also do think that we saw some positive demand characteristics across Europe as well. So those are the my observations and Mike, I don't know if you have anything different you're seeing.\nMike Sheridan: Yes. I would add, I think a couple of things. One is going back to the capacity question earlier; we have been building international capacity. And as we see some of that capacity get through their ramp, we're starting to see better productivity. That's a contributor. I think the pandemic impact is a global impact. We're seeing that. And remember our international business in terms of scale isn't as large as the overall. So having a higher percentage on a smaller scale is also a factor.\nTaylor McGinnis: Awesome. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Rishi Jaluria with Research Analysts. Proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Hi, this is Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Thanks so much for taking my questions. And congrats to both Mike and Cynthia on your new roles. Wanted to start by talking about the Liveoak acquisition. Maybe just from out from a technology perspective, I know you can do a video through that. Are there plans to kind of integrate that with other solutions out there especially in this environment with so many people using tools like Zoom to start, so that it's very natively integrated like you've been doing with the core DocuSign eSignature product for so long. And then alongside on Liveoak, I see on their kind of customer base, lot of financial services and real estate, so, some of your strongest verticals. But do you see other verticals where there's potential to expand the solution into? And then I've got a follow up.\nDan Springer: Sure. Yes. So a couple thoughts there. First off, I think you hit the nail on the head that this opportunity for this collaboration, leveraging things like video conferencing, it's a broad opportunity, and we're going to continue to be an open system for sure. And in fact, Eric, Eric, on the CEO of Zoom, and I had a conversation about this. He is super excited, as are we to expand our partnership and include their platform. So obviously fantastically successful to sort of leverage that into integration with DocuSign for these kinds of program. We believe the Liveoak guys have built some really nice tools. And I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks, but around really driving that collaboration. So to use your example of financial services, if you're doing -- an opening of an account, and say you're a large bank sort of like a Bank of America scale, customer of ours, and you used to have a lot of people opening accounts in your branches, and now your branches are closed, you need to rapidly adapt and be able to do that in a remote setting. But then we think we're really excited about, once you've done that in the remote setting, that's valuable. Even in a post COVID world, you can tell your customers, you don't have to cut the branch to open that account. You can if you want like, but we also have this remote opportunity. And the same worker, whether they're sitting in the branch or sitting in a call center can do that activity for you. We think that's super powerful. So we really want to build that out as an internal offering. And we think notary is just one of the components of it, but we believe that's going to continue to be a foundation for other people building on top of it, as you mentioned. In terms of other industries, financial services is a big one. But we can see this having a big impact in Telecom. We see there's a lot of opportunity in healthcare Life Sciences, where people are going to want to have -- we talked about telehealth a little bit on the call, and some folks doing that. We think leveraging those same technologies to improve that experience for folks is a big one. So we do think this will be broad based. But you're absolutely right, financial services, a strength of theirs I would argue, a focus of theirs and a strength of ours is the place we're probably going to see the most initial focus on our joint efforts.\nRishi Jaluria: Great. That's really helpful. And then just kind of a little bit of a financial question. But -- we've seen contract lengths kind of ticked down a little bit, which is, I think, to be expected in this environment. Just mechanically, how should it be thinking about the potential headwinds that might have on future cash flow? Thanks.\nMike Sheridan: Hi. Yes, a couple things, I don't -- on the cash flow piece of it, even on multiyear contracts, we build those annually. So we wouldn't anticipate that it would really have an impact on trends around cash flow. In terms of the contract length, you're right, it did tick down slightly to the 17 months, last quarter, I think was 18 months. And so what we're seeing in our bookings is we do have some waiting coming in on small to mid that's having some impact. And we're also seeing some larger enterprises as everybody's navigating through the current economic situation, being a little more conservative in terms of the length of contracts that they're signing up to. They're not massive changes, but those are kind of the two things that are affecting that statistic.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Thanks. And congrats on the quarter and on the new roles for Mike and Cynthia. Dan, I wanted to ask a question. Obviously, you guys have signed up a tremendous amount of new customers this year. And when you think about those customers, renewing, hopefully in a year from now, or maybe even sooner, is there a cadence when if they didn't want to discuss sort of the broader Agreement Cloud that they start thinking about it, meaning, when you think about 12 months from now and you have all these new customers, you just signed up. I'm just kind of curious, historically, what you've seen in terms of the cadence, whether it's been six, nine, 12, 18 months. And I guess, when you go back into those accounts, is it the same person? Or is your account manager, you really need to navigate the organization to maybe sell a little bit higher when you start talking about the Agreement Cloud. I'm just kind of curious about how that maybe plays out in your mind over the next year or two? Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yes. So it's a good question. And as you might imagine, the first answer is it depends, right? It depends a lot on the size of the customer and the vertical for sure. But I'll try to give you some again higher level; we'll call them averages to give you some perspective about it. In general, customers come in and they sign up. And there's some process before adoption happens. Is one of the reasons you've heard Mike talk a lot about our investments in customer success, the faster we get people to adopt, they quickly get that strong ROI people get from DocuSign, and then they start looking for more opportunities to grow. And so, what we tend to find is on the smaller customers, they're there within a month. We adopted it going quickly. And some of the larger enterprise customers, it might be several months, because they have like a program manager that gets involved, right? There's a lot of process that occurs. And so that's probably the biggest determinant of why there's variability in that time. And then once people start adopting, and driving the success of those first use cases, the next biggest determinant on the timing is how much they bought. So some people had that initial land that was quite small, it was conservative, then before they get to the end of the year, they're coming back and they're buying more if they implement that first project effectively as most do. Some people have said, we want to be aspirational in our first buy. They might be in a situation. They might also do a multiyear contract if it's an enterprise player, but they might do a three-year buy, and they won't be talking to us for two years. Right? So there's a lot of variability depending on how much they bought, and how aspirational they were in those initial volumes. And that's a very signature centric answer. Let me switch gears and talk a little about the rest of the Agreement Cloud. So again, if you're a SMB that came to us on the web, we're not trying to sell you a broader Agreement Cloud story at this point. We have some additional enhancements that we have specifically on the Salesforce ecosystem, as an example, we have a prepare product for Salesforce, which is great, but we're not generally coming back to those people and saying, let's talk to you about CLM, because it's Mom and Pop business. But as you start getting to the larger customers, if they did land with signature, and particularly what's happened with COVID, as I talked about earlier, so many of the lands have been signature centric. We now will be coming back to them six, nine months in saying let's talk about expansion and signature, because that's our land and expand model. But let's also start reminding you, one of the reasons you went with DocuSign was you were excited about that longer term vision of Agreement Cloud, and see that starting to play. So I think across that year, it'll be weighted towards the end of the year. But you'll see us in that nine, 12 months from today, with the winds were bringing in, looking for expansion opportunity for signature for all of them, and signature plus Agreement Cloud expansion for the mid market and larger customers.\nKirk Materne: That's very helpful. And if I guess, just one other follow up. Obviously, incredible growth this year, you're much bigger company; you're going cash flow at a faster rate. Does that change any of the way you think about M&A or some of the things you might have had five years from now maybe pulling those forward in terms of either it sounds like Mike going international, sounds like you're speeding that process up? Or is there anything I guess from a balance sheet perspective that really changes just given the kind of growth you've had, and frankly, the higher free cash flow that you're now generating?\nDan Springer: Yes. Nothing from me that's in a significant way. One of the things we started doing acquisitions two years ago, when we announced SpringCM and sort of the newer DocuSign, or at least within my time here coming up on four years, was saying, hey, guys, we're not going to become some massive acquisition machine. We want to do as smart deals that we can digest effectively. We want to have a very high batting average on successful deals. We've now done our third deal. To be honest, I would have thought we might have been a little bit of a wait before the third deal. The deal was not very large for bringing in the notary capability with Liveoak. But I feel good about the deal sizes we're doing. It's true with our balance sheet, we could probably open ourselves up to much larger deals economically, but we don't really think about it economically. We think about it from a customer success standpoint, what are our customers want, and fulfilling our vision of the Agreement Cloud. And one of the things that's tricky is, when turns up all the companies in the broadly defined Agreement Cloud, there aren't other DocuSign. There aren't other very large players. So I don't think there's a sort of a population of big deals that we would see at this point in time is being in that Agreement Cloud vision. Is it possible over time continue to grow and expand and become more expansionary than the Agreement Cloud, and then therefore look at maybe more significant size deals, I wouldn't rule that out. But as I look into what's visible, I feel really good about the strategy we have right now. The deals we're doing, I think, are high quality. They're on strategy for us. And I think if we look out into the possible future deals, they'll probably be more in that ballpark of size, because that's just the size of where companies are in the Agreement Cloud landscape. I don't know, Mike, if you have any different views, but I feel good about where we are right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from lines of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congratulations in a superb quarter. You ramped up your Op margins, you ramp up your free cash flows, your sales productivity is, at least from what I can tell all time high. I'm curious to see if you can expand upon the things that helped sales productivity in the quarter whether you measure through the lens of billings or revenue. And how sustainable are these trends? And finally, does it change your view of the long term operating model to the upside?\nDan Springer: Let me talk a little bit about the sales productivity side. And Mike, you can talk about if you're willing to change our long term operating model on the call. Kash, I'm not sure, but we'll see. Your outgoing time as CFO, -- Cynthia a gift. My perspective is that, I think the success we've had in terms of sales productivity is to be really clear. It's been the secondary goal. The primary goal has been growth. And we told you, we want to continue to invest to achieve the -- growth. Now at the scale we've achieved, because we feel we see opportunity for productivity improvement. I'll tell you, it's not our focus. Our focus is still on meeting this significant demand opportunity. But just with that scale, it's sort of just comes to us. So my view is that we haven't done anything dramatically differently there. There's been a little bit of a focus that I've been pushing on to that team, to say, let's think about overlays. Let's think about complexity. As we grow this business, make sure we don't get so much complexity in the business, that we lose our ability to simply execute. And so I think that focus there on sort of simplification is probably having a nice little positive impact. And then scale is the other aspect that's driving the productivity there. In terms of that impact on the long term model, my starting point would be, we kind of forecast that this was going to happen. I think it's playing out pretty much consistently with the long term model and the path that Mike had built, but I'll give him the option. to comment on that, if he sees it differently.\nMike Sheridan: No. It just as a reminder, our long term operating margin model shows 20% to 25% over a roughly four year timeframe, and I think we're still tracking to that target with during that period of time. As we've always said, it's been a period where we anticipate an opportunity for high growth and we're going to continue to invest in all those drivers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, thanks, and good afternoon. Certainly an impressive quarter. So congrats to the team from my end as well. Maybe another one on the execution side was hoping you could maybe compare and contrast the first half of the year given the bigger surge in demand you're seeing. We all saw a big shift and having to pivot over to remote work on the fly last quarter. Were there things you were able to improve internally here in Q2 as we settle into this new way of working that made the execution even better given the acceleration you're delivering here on some of the key metrics? Thank you.\nDan Springer: And again, my point of view is I think we're continuing to execute. Well, I think it's harder, quite frankly, doing everything in a remote environment. And I think it's taxing on our people. It's harder work for all of us. And to be blunt about it, I think we mostly like to get back into a situation where we are mostly able to be in the office, I think, though the world's changed a little bit. We probably have in the longer run, highly productive system, where some people are increasing, they're a little bit of time out of the office, because we've shown that we can still be productive in that environment  But from an efficiency standpoint, I think we'd actually be now even more efficient if we could be back in the office and have some of those collaboration benefits. From the standpoint of translate to the financial results, again, I don't think there's anything that's played out in these financials that I would say, accelerated efficiency, because of remote work. I suppose the only thing I would point to as sort of an obvious is that we don't have the T&E expense. And that has been somewhat of improvement. But we've actually spent some of those savings on other things, both funding growth, as well as supporting our employees in terms of things like helping them with a DocuSign cares program, helping them set up in a home office in a way that allows them to be productive at home. I don't have anything else about it. That would seem different to me from that standpoint. I don't know if you, Mike to add.\nMike Sheridan: The only other thing I would mention is, we are learning as we go, we see things for example, like attrition rates that we plan and budget for. We were outperforming those. Our attrition is much better than what was planned. A, because I think people really like working for DocuSign and B, I think in the current environment, people aren't as mobile as they would be during the norm. We're seeing things like our spending related to paid time off, people aren't taking as much paid time off because of course they're working from home and that just doesn't make a lot of sense. There's not a lot of places to travel. So the endpoint there's a lot of the ins and outs that we're seeing in the model. So I think as we plan for fiscal 2022, and we're obviously entering that phase right now. You're right; there is a lot of learning going on. That's going to allow us I think to hit the mark in terms of how we should think about spending for the coming year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. So thank you very much. So this is a quite an impressive report against a more difficult comparison. You accelerated your growth. And the acceleration was broad based. It was indirect. It was in web. It was international. And so my question is, how much of this acceleration was due to COVID? And how much was due to other factors like you've mentioned, increased demand seen in Europe?\nMike Sheridan: Yes. I would say, Shebly, of course, we're looking as carefully as we can into the numbers to try to glean that out. I am comfortable saying the following. We came into the year with a fiscal plan. And with or without COVID, our performance is exceeding that plan across the globe. Obviously once you put the pandemic effect and work from home effect on top of that its generating these much higher growth numbers. But we were exceeding our plan results pre and post.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dan Springer for closing remarks.\nDan Springer: Thank you very much. And I really appreciate you all being here today. Its been the fantastic quarter. And we will look forward to seeing you, mostly likely seeing you through video in the coming months until we see you next quarter. And just then one last comment, I'd like to thank Mike again for his incredible leadership over five years of stewarding the financial ship here. And I can't tell you how excited I am to look forward as we built the international business together. Thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Mike Sheridan",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into my comments on the corner quarter, I'd like to thank Dan and the board for entrusting me with my new role as President of International. We have a great strength in our international operations today, has achieved impressive growth over the last several years. I look forward to working with this great team to expand upon the success. I also want to welcome and congratulate Cynthia Gaylor as our new CFO. As Dan mentioned, he and I have had the opportunity over the last couple of years to work with Cynthia as a board member. And during that time, she has become very familiar with DocuSign's financial operations. I am confident that Cynthia will hit the ground running as she joins the team. Turning to our Q2 results, strong sales led by our eSignature solutions were over 61% year-over-year increase in billings to $406 million. This also drove a 45% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $342 million in the second quarter. Subscription revenue increased 47% year-over-year to $324 million. We saw particular strength outside the U.S. as total International revenue grew over 59% year-over-year to $67 million. This quarter, we added over 88,000 new customers, of those, over 10,000 were direct customers, an increase of 55% year-over-year. This brings our total customer base to nearly 749,000 worldwide with over 99,000 direct customers. Strong eSignature expansions and upsells into our existing customer base led to a record dollar net retention rate of 120% in the quarter. Customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 41% year-over-year, to a total of 520 customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 78%, consistent with a year ago. Subscription gross margin was 83% compared with 84% a year ago. Margins were impacted by our Seal acquisition as well as by investments we made in our data center capacity, particularly for hosted services to ensure our ability to meet significantly higher transaction volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $233 million, or 68% of total revenue in the quarter, compared with $185 million, or 78% of total revenue in Q2 last year. We generated $34 million in non-GAAP operating profit or a 10% operating margin in the quarter. This compares with an operating loss of less than $1 million in the second quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income was $35 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2 million in the second quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 5008 employees, an increase of 44% over the second quarter of last year, second [ph] quarter increased nearly 350% year-over-year to $118 million compared with $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $100 million in the quarter compared with $12 million a year ago. CapEx increased during the quarter due to leasehold improvements in Brazil, as well as the completion of our federal data center. Now, let me turn to guidance. We anticipate total revenue of $358 million to $362 million in Q3, and $1.384 billion to $1.388 billion for fiscal 2021. Of this total, we expect subscription revenue of $343 million to $347 million in Q3, and $1.315 billion to $1.319 billion for fiscal 2021. For Billings, we expect $380 million to $390 million in Q3, and $1.623 billion to $1.643 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q3 and fiscal 2021. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing in the range of 46% to 48% of revenues for Q3, and 45% to 47% for fiscal 2021. R&D in the range of 14% to 16%, for Q3 and for fiscal 2021. And finally, G&A in the range of 9% to 11%, for Q3 and for fiscal 2021. For Non-GAAP interest and other we expect $1 million of expense to $1 million of income and for fiscal 2021 we expect for $4 million to $6 million of non-GAAP interest and non-operating income. We expect the tax provision of approximately $2 million to $3 million for Q3, and $7 million to $9 million for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 200 to 205 million shares for Q3 and fiscal 2021. Thanks for joining us today, and we will now open the call for Q&A. Yes, thanks Sterling. A couple of things. I would say that if you look at the scale of International today, it's over $200 million in revenue. And the team is executing very well. I just reported a 59% year-over-year increase in revenues. So there's definitely growth already being achieved. If you think about that scale, it's similar to what DocuSign was about five years ago when I joined DocuSign. At that time, DocuSign was also a very rapidly growing organization. So as we've looked at many of the challenges that we needed to deal with at that stage of the total company, are showing themselves in our International region. So much of the work that I'm going to be doing is going to look a lot like the work that we've been working on over the last several years as we scale the whole business. I think what really makes this work is in my role as CFO, I've worked on so many of the very same kinds of issues. I've developed strong relationships with the executive staff in headquarters, as well as the leaders across the globe. So we have a lot of foundation in terms of what the nature of the investments are going to be. I think we're tracking well. I think a lot of what we're seeing is that the structure of our International operations today look like what they were when we formed them, four or five, six years ago, which is direct line reporting into headquarters, which is appropriate. But I think what I can bring is a greater focus into that area where I can work with the executive members as well as the regional leaders to figure out how they work together across those reporting lines to figure out what are the right in region investments and structures that that can drive that growth further? Yes, so the guidance that I provided shows that they're going to, for the, for the period of time to the end of this fiscal year stay in those high 70s to low 80 kind of range. There was one impact in Q2 that related to our acquisition of Seal, which had an impact on the margin that was slightly dilutive as we anticipated. The other impact on margins right now is that as I mentioned, we have pretty significant increases in our transaction volumes. And so we're continuing to build out our infrastructure, data center infrastructure and other to ensure that we kind of keep our SLAs tracking as we're, as we're consuming those greater transaction volumes. So we're absorbing those into the existing margins, but I think they're going to be stable at that level to the end of the fiscal year. Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes, we obviously for the last couple of quarters have been at the higher end of that range. Actually, this quarter, we exceeded it a little bit. I'm not going to update a guidance range for it. We will be upgrading that guidance range when we provide guidance for fiscal 2022. But with that said, I think what we've seen in these recent quarters in terms of growth strengthening around $1 net retention and our ability to upsell into our installed base should keep us on the higher half of that range. Yes, so I would say a couple things out there. I think in Q3 our guidance has billings growth year-over-year well into the 40 percentile. So I do feel like, we're off to a good start in Q3 and it's reflected in the guidance like we've talked about in the past. There's a lot of variables Dan alluded to it in his comments that we're subject to like everybody else. We're trying to figure them out real time. We feel very good about the second half. We guide what we can see we don't we don't guess, we always aspire for the highest level of growth we can accomplish, but I think the guidance is reasonably balanced and positive. Hi, Taylor. Yes, couple of things. One, if you look at the scale of our eSignature business compared to the scale of the CLM, and the data analytics or agreements -- sorry, agreement analytics businesses, eSignature is dramatically larger. So that statistic is going to largely succeed or not succeed based upon our success in eSignature, our upsells or volume expansions and all of those things. That is not to say that the Agreement Cloud expansions are not important. They are. But that is a much longer term trajectory before you'll start to see them have a meaningful movement in a broader statistic like that. So as we talked about those businesses and how they're growing and the comments that Dan made, I think those are all critical. But in terms of the near term quarter-to-quarter impact on something like dollar net retention, eSignature volumes are just going to overwhelm it. So you won't see it so much statistic like that. Yes. I would add, I think a couple of things. One is going back to the capacity question earlier; we have been building international capacity. And as we see some of that capacity get through their ramp, we're starting to see better productivity. That's a contributor. I think the pandemic impact is a global impact. We're seeing that. And remember our international business in terms of scale isn't as large as the overall. So having a higher percentage on a smaller scale is also a factor. Hi. Yes, a couple things, I don't -- on the cash flow piece of it, even on multiyear contracts, we build those annually. So we wouldn't anticipate that it would really have an impact on trends around cash flow. In terms of the contract length, you're right, it did tick down slightly to the 17 months, last quarter, I think was 18 months. And so what we're seeing in our bookings is we do have some waiting coming in on small to mid that's having some impact. And we're also seeing some larger enterprises as everybody's navigating through the current economic situation, being a little more conservative in terms of the length of contracts that they're signing up to. They're not massive changes, but those are kind of the two things that are affecting that statistic. No. It just as a reminder, our long term operating margin model shows 20% to 25% over a roughly four year timeframe, and I think we're still tracking to that target with during that period of time. As we've always said, it's been a period where we anticipate an opportunity for high growth and we're going to continue to invest in all those drivers. The only other thing I would mention is, we are learning as we go, we see things for example, like attrition rates that we plan and budget for. We were outperforming those. Our attrition is much better than what was planned. A, because I think people really like working for DocuSign and B, I think in the current environment, people aren't as mobile as they would be during the norm. We're seeing things like our spending related to paid time off, people aren't taking as much paid time off because of course they're working from home and that just doesn't make a lot of sense. There's not a lot of places to travel. So the endpoint there's a lot of the ins and outs that we're seeing in the model. So I think as we plan for fiscal 2022, and we're obviously entering that phase right now. You're right; there is a lot of learning going on. That's going to allow us I think to hit the mark in terms of how we should think about spending for the coming year. Yes. I would say, Shebly, of course, we're looking as carefully as we can into the numbers to try to glean that out. I am comfortable saying the following. We came into the year with a fiscal plan. And with or without COVID, our performance is exceeding that plan across the globe. Obviously once you put the pandemic effect and work from home effect on top of that its generating these much higher growth numbers. But we were exceeding our plan results pre and post."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call for fiscal 2021. I appreciate everyone joining us today and I would like to cover four key areas of the business with you. The evolution of COVID-19 and the impact we are seeing on our business, the essential role that eSignature and the Agreement Cloud continue to play in the digital transformation of our customer's businesses around the world, our recent acquisition to accelerate the opportunity in remote on-line notary and a few additions to the Board and executive team, including Mike Sheridan's new international leadership role. So let's start with the evolving dynamics of the pandemic. It would be an understatement to say that we're all still experiencing significant changes in the way that we work and live as a result of COVID-19. We're seeing it with our more than 5000 employees around the world as we don't expect to return to an office environment until June of next year. As a team, we're focused on helping each other adapt to these changing circumstances and to balance the myriad demands on our collective time. We're seeing it with our customers too. I spoke last quarter about how so many of them faced a sudden need to transition to remote work when the pandemic first hit. Today, that need has evolved from an initial crisis response to a business necessity. And because Agreements are central to doing business, the need to agree electronically and remotely has never been stronger. This is causing greater adoption of our offerings, something we believe will persist beyond the crisis, because in our experience it's very rare to see anyone go back to paper once they've gone digital. The upside of all this is that DocuSign is becoming an increasingly essential Cloud Software Platform for organizations of all types of sizes, a fact that is well reflected in our Q2 results. Billings grew 61% year-over-year to $406 million and revenue grew 45% to $342 million. We added more than 88,000 new customers bringing our total to nearly three quarters of a million worldwide. For perspective, we acquired more new customers in the first half of this year than we did in all of last year. Our operating margins and cash flows reached record levels, while we continued to make key investments to address the heightened demand. As is evident from these numbers the trends that emerged in the latter half of Q1 have continued throughout Q2. We've seen a sustained rise in demand for our core eSignature offering not only from new customers but also those expanding across used cases, departments and board rooms. The interest in transforming other parts of the agreement process is growing too, and that in turn creates pipeline for the rest of the agreement cloud suite. Now let me give you some examples of recent customer wins and expansion. One of our largest retail customers runs a network of healthcare clinics within its stores. When COVID-19 hit the company accelerated plans to provide tele health services, using DocuSign eSignature to handle consent and other paperwork remotely. This is a great example of COVID accelerated demand that we see as durable. Now telehealth will remain after COVID-19 but the paperless processes that came with it will likely end up getting implemented for in person clinic visits too, because the electronic way is more efficient and a better experience than paper and clipboards. Another example is from a large financial institution that's a long-time DocuSign customer. The Company already used eSignature widely, but when COVID-19 hit, it accelerated plans for further rollouts and together we helped activate 11 new lines of business. This illustrates the pattern we're seeing where established customers are now bringing eSignature to new divisions, departments and regions. This was going to happen at some point, but it's just happening faster now. Finally, I have a few examples from an area of the economy I know you are all interested in, the public sector. To date, we held a strong competitive position for local, state and federal levels here in the United States. This quarter, we built on that base with a healthy mix of eSignature and multi product Agreement Cloud deals, including DocuSign CLM, and our identity family of products. We helped a major city deploy a digitized workflow, to handle applications for housing assistance, and we enabled the federal agency to capture applications and distribute relief funds to healthcare providers on the front lines of Coronavirus response. So, in summary, it was an exceptional quarter for customer growth and expansion. Economic headwinds did cause some to request relief, but that was more than offset by increased demand overall. And while DocuSign faces the same economic uncertainty as everyone else, we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver increasing and durable value, no matter where business is conducted. I'd like to move on now to how we're investing in innovation and new Agreement Cloud product offerings. Specifically, I'd like to talk about our acquisition in July of Liveoak Technologies, an Austin based start-up that was already a close partner of ours. For agreements that would normally require people to be together in person, Liveoak enables the transaction to be done remotely via video conferencing. The company's platform includes several other technologies specific to remote agreements too, such as video identity verification, collaborative form filling, and integration with DocuSign eSignature, and a detailed audit trail. With this acquisition, we will leverage Liveoak's technology to accelerate the launch of DocuSign notary, a solution for remote online notarization where signaries and the notary public are in different places. DocuSign Notary will do for notarization what eSignature did for signing. It will enable a dramatically better experience for everyone involved from wherever they may be. We believe this is a natural extension of our eSignature business. And once people use remote online notarization, we don't expect them to go back. In fact, when we announced this move, the customer response was very clearly how soon can I get it? And the answer is a DocuSign Notary is slated for beta release later this year. The initial version will be for existing customers that already have a notary capability within their organization, or what we call first party notary. And we expect to enable third party notaries in the near future. Now, before I close out my remarks, I wanted to share a few enhancements to our board and executive team. I'm thrilled to share that Theresa Briggs and James Beer have recently joined our Board of Directors. Theresa is assuming the role of Audit Committee Chair and she brings a wealth of financial experience from Deloitte as well as fantastic and relevant Board experience at ServiceNow and Snowflake. James has extensive financial experience as CFO at Atlassian today, previously at American Airlines, McKesson, and Symantec, all of which will be invaluable as we continue to scale our business. On the executive team, we have appointed Kamal Hathi as Chief Technology Officer reporting into Tom Casey. In this new role, Kamal will oversee the development and execution of our overall technology roadmap. Given his 20-plus year run at Microsoft, and his recent experience at Trader Interactive, we believe Kamal is the ideal person to build the platform that powers the Agreement Cloud as it continues to scale. I'm also excited to announce that I'm promoting Mike Sheridan to the role of President of International at DocuSign. And that Cynthia Gaylor, a current board member and audit committee chair will be joining as our new CFO. As you've heard me say in almost every call today, international business is a key growth driver for us, international growth with over 60% this quarter, and his contribution to our overall business is increasing. Since the beginning of this year, Mike has been spearheading our growth initiatives across EMEA. Given the strong results of his efforts there, we are now broadening his scope to drive growth across all international markets. So I couldn't be more pleased for Mike and for DocuSign to be doubling down on international. Of course, we couldn't do this if we didn't have access to a CFO like Cynthia. She brings more than 25 years of finance and capital markets experience with an extensive background in strategy and operations as well a deep understanding of enterprise and consumer software. Most recently, she was the CFO of Pivotal Software, prior to which she led corporate development at Twitter, and was a Managing Director in the Morgan Stanley technology biz. I'm looking forward to working closely with Cynthia in an operating capacity as we continue to drive the business forward. As Mike and I worked through the scope of his new role over the past few months, we also collaborated with Cynthia so she could hit the ground running. She will continue to partner closely with Mike and myself over the next several months to ensure a strong and seamless transition. So with that, I'd like to welcome Cynthia to the team and to again congratulate Mike on his new role. I'll close this out by saying that the catalysts for further digital transformation remain strong. And we firmly believe DocuSign can continue to deliver value across the entire agreement cycle. And our strong Q2 combined with the momentum we're seeing as we enter Q3 gives us confidence in the business. While the pandemic continues to have an unpredictable effect on the market at large, we will stay nimble and will continue to do everything we can to help our customers, partners and employees adapt, transform, and move forward. Now, let me turn it over to Mike for a deeper dive on the financials and some comments on his new role. Mike? Yes. So, Stan, I think what we're seeing is sort of what we talked about last quarter, continue the dramatic pull from our customers and prospects for eSignature with a very high, you know, enablement time, very quick ROI, and just the need for people to take that first step into the Agreement Cloud. And as most people do enter into Agreement Cloud is to eSignature. That's been the -- that's the headline story. And if we look at our growth, it's been more significant in the traditional aspects of our business than any other part. And we're very clear, when we go to our field, we say that you have to when you talk to customers and you talk to prospects, you start off every conversation with DocuSign Agreement Cloud Company, let me tell you how we're going to help you prepare, sign, act on and manage your agreement. And if that individual says to you, yes, I'd like to buy some eSignature to get started right now, the only appropriate answer is yes sir, or yes ma'am. I'm happy to sell you some eSignature. And that's what we're going to continue to do through this period of time. We want to really support what the customers are needing. But at the same time, as I mentioned up front, we're seeing a lot of people saying the concept of the Agreement Cloud is really something they're embracing. And they're saying we'd love to figure out a way to broaden the relationship with DocuSign. We believe that things like DocuSign CLM, which is the with the SpringCM product, we've turned it into here, will continue to be strong, we see a lot of demand, we're building a lot of pipe for it. And the customers that we're bringing in right now, 88,000, new customers, many of those will be prospects for CLM in the future. But we believe that the sales cycle there will always be a little bit longer, they're more complex. Usually there's a services component, right? So it has to be a statement of work calculated and done. And a lot of times I think we're seeing CIOs and CFOs at our customers today are saying I want to do that. But right now I need to get these signature pieces enabled. Let's do that now and as we get later into the year and more settled and settle down in their company is where I think we'll see increased demand and pull through of those other components. So in terms of two things, one is, we have sort of a linearity and we do a lot of our forecasting. We've looked at how quarters build across the month. And the one thing I would tell you in the last couple of quarters, we've seen some I would call positive trend where we are having less of a back end, wait to our quarter. And I would say that, you'd expect that of course, to be on our web and mobile business, which tend to have relatively even linearity, right. Whereas an enterprise of course, it had the biggest back waiting in the quarter. But we're seeing it across the board, even with the enterprise, more evenness. I think some of that is execution on our part. I think we're putting a lot of focus on thinking about monthly closes versus just quarterly closes. But I would also tell you that I believe in the marketplace, we're just seeing demand being stronger, and so people are coming to us through all parts of the quarter, just trying to get deals done. So we're probably seeing some positivity there. But that's the -- I don't think there's been a dramatic change and I don't think we see anything in the way we're forecasting. Michael, if you see something different, feel free to share it. But, I think we're not seeing a lot of a lot of dramatic change, just a slight improvement in that, and that gives us more predictability as we look through the quarter. Well, I think when we talked about Seal starting off, I think the answer is there was only two parts to this. And we're still excited about both. One was this sort of intelligent insights, which is I think the core agreement analytics products that we've been partnering, you know, with CLM when they were a partner before the acquisition. And we continue to see that's going to be something that a lot of our customers are going to want to do. And we're very excited about that. And then the second piece was about integrating the Seal AI technology into our CLM offering. So as you saw, when the Gartner report came out on CLM, we were the only two companies that were in that upper right hand quadrant and we feel we had a fantastic entry with DocuSign CLM. And yet, we also felt internally, the place where we had the biggest improvement opportunity was to really integrate agreement analytics into that CLM product. And so that is the Second big piece. So on the first one Intelligent Insights, I think we're there. And it was a product that was fairly, close to standalone, there's some things we needed to do to make it DocuSign quality, let's call that, in terms of things like security and reliability, and we're still making investments on that front. But I would say we say that that product is pretty much ready for primetime and our people are now out aggressively selling that into our base. In terms of the integration with CLM. That's something that's still quarters away. We still have a lot of engineering and R&D work as you referred to it to make that the fulfill that promise we have for our CLM product, where it's going very well. I think we're highly confident, but we think that will be early next year before I can really put my hand on my heart and tell you that work is complete. And the DocuSign CLM product has a fully integrated advanced agreement analytics functionality, one that will allow us to be significantly stronger than other players in the market. Yes, yes. So TAM is actually a really interesting topic within the notary space. We've taken a couple looks at it, we've looked at other reports. We're basically saying, we think this approaches about a billion dollars. So if you look at this, and you think about it in the construct of a $25 billion, TAM for eSignature, it's not a dramatic increase. But it's a really nice piece. And the bigger side of it for us is, so many of our customers have said to us, we really would love to have a notary capability. And particularly for those larger customers that have what we call first party notary, they already have a notary capability in their business. They really are excited to integrate this into their offering. We see that a lot with the financial institutions who have been pushing us. So as much as anything, this is like a feature enhancement that we think we'll have a nice, billion bucks. That's not a bad increment to go after. But it's not it's not like sort of a earth shattering change in our business. We look at this as a really nice tuck-in that our customers are asking for. And this good piece for us to go after. And then, it opens the opportunity to go after the third party notary space. And we have 10 people tend to think about that the individual notaries that are driving around for people to do real estate transactions, and we would love to then really transform that business as well as so many customers have come to us and said in the past, that would be a great opportunity for DocuSign to make their lives a little more agreeable. If I had the answer to that one, I would be selling it in a lot of different ways that for sure. But I can tell you this, the good news is because we had built such a such a strong culture and that's why our Glassdoor scores are so high, and we do so well on those, you know, Best Places to Work surveys, and why our own surveys our employee engagement so high is because we built a fantastic culture where people really believe in our values, and fundamentally, they're excited to work in a place that puts customer success as our top priority even above our financial results. And people get excited about the pride they have for working here. None of that has changed. Well, it's harder to have those personal connections to people, when we don't have people coming into the office. And each day that goes by a bigger percentage of DocuSign owners have never met personally, one of their colleagues. We're about to cross over $1,000 DocuSigners that have joined since we were doing remote office work. So it's going to get tougher and tougher. And I think the real answer is increased communications, we are looking at changing up the mix of communications. And some of the things are harder. But I'll tell you something else, some of the things are better. I'll just give you one example, Pat. So in the past, we have an event called discovering DocuSign, where we would invite people and they join shortly after the join to Seattle is where the company was founded. And we met with a bunch of other new DocuSigners. And we had different executives come in and talk to them about the company over a couple days. I didn't get to attend that very often, just because my schedule and what I need, I couldn't always be there. In fact, I started to be there less and less. Now that we do that as a remote event, I'm there every time. So every new DocuSign employee could be a good thing or bad thing depending how you look at it Pat. But they get an opportunity to meet Dan Springer. And we get created, create a connection, and quite a few of them send me emails right afterwards. And we've now built a different kind of connection. So it's remote, but we're figuring out creative ways to find different communication styles and techniques to put us into a place where I think we can continue to this a place for people to do the work their lives. But it's ever -- this is not one that's going to over quickly. We're going to have to continue to be creative to do if we want to continue to earn that great relationship we have at our employees. Yes. So couple of things. I would say capacity, we are continuing to expand our capacity pretty aggressively. As you saw from the hiring statistics that I had mentioned. We're now over 5000 employees, year-over-year growth 44%, substantial amount of that is in our go-to-market organization, not just on sales capacity, of course marketing capacity as well and customer success capacity. And so, we are endeavoring to stay ahead of the trends that we're seeing. We're working to see the demand data very carefully to try to forecast trends and get ahead of that with capacity across the business. In terms of what will we anticipate post-COVID? I don't know that anybody have a great answer for that. It is our view that as we work through these difficult time so, there is a greater awareness of the need to digitize the business. And we believe that's going to be staying even after things returned to whatever normal look like in the future. So, we do believe that we're entering into a period of a \"new normal\". It doesn't necessarily mean that the highs of any particular quarter going to sustain forever. But at the same time, we don't see trends that things are going to return to the way they looked and trended pre-COVID. So we're designing the business. We're designing our marketing activities and our sales activities to stay on top of that as possible. Yes. Koji, its really interesting question. One thing that's always hard in answering a question around sort of more kind of shifts like that is what's behind? Is it maturation of our business? Is it related to COVID etcetera? My view is from a COVID standpoint, as the nature of your question is we went through a period of time where people just got very focused six months ago on -- we need to get things up and going quickly. We need to work in a remote environment. And with certain use cases that we can't run our business, we can't figure them out. So it was not about that that naval gazing and deep thought about their processes. It's about getting some of these primarily eSignature workflows in place. And while I think there is still some of that for sure that has definitely calm down. And I think the number of people that are rushing to us saying, I need to make a quick adjustment to be able to deal with like this. They haven't got it done by now. And they miss that window. We are seeing now as people saying, wow, this is fantastic. There more place where I could leverage this in my business. And we're looking at expansion as we talked about of use cases within our base to more and more places that as I said before. We only think they would have gotten there eventually. It just accelerated those. And we're continuing to see that acceleration of those workflows into DocuSign, because they realized how beneficial they are to their business. From the standpoint to that more platform thinking, I don't know that I would say, I seen that increase and I don't know if I say this increase would be due to the COVID. The natural maturation for a lot of folks with us around the Agreement Cloud opportunity is as they start hearing us described this future. They say while I could see you as a more strategic part of my sort of IT infrastructure and my business process infrastructure. And so I think that's occurring more and more. But I think that's more to do with the fact that we're just getting bigger and having larger relationships with companies as we scale. You look at that number of customers above $300,000 which is just sort of one minute [ph] that keeps growing substantially. And so I think that's driving it more than a COVID reaction. But again, it's hard to sort of separate out each of those components. But that would be my view. I think Mike's involvement in international, Taylor; it's clearly been the driver in the increased growth there. And around the company, we couldn't be more excited that he's off to such a good start. From your sense about the market, and I think it's mostly Mike's execution. But for your sense about the market, I don't think we have seen anything different. We have seen different levels of success in different geographies. It was phenomenal for us to be able to say that every single geography that we have was above plan in the quarter. And we're in a bunch of geographies. So that's pretty impressive. I would tell you, there's some markets that I was going to point, to one that was particularly strong, I would say LATAM, and our Brazil team crushed it. But if I said to the area where I saw the most improvement, because we've been crushing it there for a while, I'd say was Europe. And I think, again, with tongue out of my cheek, I'll say, I do think, Mike, leadership in Europe has helped us perform a little better there and execute better. And it's big reason. We're so excited for this broader expansion of his role to all of international. But I also do think that we saw some positive demand characteristics across Europe as well. So those are the my observations and Mike, I don't know if you have anything different you're seeing. Sure. Yes. So a couple thoughts there. First off, I think you hit the nail on the head that this opportunity for this collaboration, leveraging things like video conferencing, it's a broad opportunity, and we're going to continue to be an open system for sure. And in fact, Eric, Eric, on the CEO of Zoom, and I had a conversation about this. He is super excited, as are we to expand our partnership and include their platform. So obviously fantastically successful to sort of leverage that into integration with DocuSign for these kinds of program. We believe the Liveoak guys have built some really nice tools. And I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks, but around really driving that collaboration. So to use your example of financial services, if you're doing -- an opening of an account, and say you're a large bank sort of like a Bank of America scale, customer of ours, and you used to have a lot of people opening accounts in your branches, and now your branches are closed, you need to rapidly adapt and be able to do that in a remote setting. But then we think we're really excited about, once you've done that in the remote setting, that's valuable. Even in a post COVID world, you can tell your customers, you don't have to cut the branch to open that account. You can if you want like, but we also have this remote opportunity. And the same worker, whether they're sitting in the branch or sitting in a call center can do that activity for you. We think that's super powerful. So we really want to build that out as an internal offering. And we think notary is just one of the components of it, but we believe that's going to continue to be a foundation for other people building on top of it, as you mentioned. In terms of other industries, financial services is a big one. But we can see this having a big impact in Telecom. We see there's a lot of opportunity in healthcare Life Sciences, where people are going to want to have -- we talked about telehealth a little bit on the call, and some folks doing that. We think leveraging those same technologies to improve that experience for folks is a big one. So we do think this will be broad based. But you're absolutely right, financial services, a strength of theirs I would argue, a focus of theirs and a strength of ours is the place we're probably going to see the most initial focus on our joint efforts. Yes. So it's a good question. And as you might imagine, the first answer is it depends, right? It depends a lot on the size of the customer and the vertical for sure. But I'll try to give you some again higher level; we'll call them averages to give you some perspective about it. In general, customers come in and they sign up. And there's some process before adoption happens. Is one of the reasons you've heard Mike talk a lot about our investments in customer success, the faster we get people to adopt, they quickly get that strong ROI people get from DocuSign, and then they start looking for more opportunities to grow. And so, what we tend to find is on the smaller customers, they're there within a month. We adopted it going quickly. And some of the larger enterprise customers, it might be several months, because they have like a program manager that gets involved, right? There's a lot of process that occurs. And so that's probably the biggest determinant of why there's variability in that time. And then once people start adopting, and driving the success of those first use cases, the next biggest determinant on the timing is how much they bought. So some people had that initial land that was quite small, it was conservative, then before they get to the end of the year, they're coming back and they're buying more if they implement that first project effectively as most do. Some people have said, we want to be aspirational in our first buy. They might be in a situation. They might also do a multiyear contract if it's an enterprise player, but they might do a three-year buy, and they won't be talking to us for two years. Right? So there's a lot of variability depending on how much they bought, and how aspirational they were in those initial volumes. And that's a very signature centric answer. Let me switch gears and talk a little about the rest of the Agreement Cloud. So again, if you're a SMB that came to us on the web, we're not trying to sell you a broader Agreement Cloud story at this point. We have some additional enhancements that we have specifically on the Salesforce ecosystem, as an example, we have a prepare product for Salesforce, which is great, but we're not generally coming back to those people and saying, let's talk to you about CLM, because it's Mom and Pop business. But as you start getting to the larger customers, if they did land with signature, and particularly what's happened with COVID, as I talked about earlier, so many of the lands have been signature centric. We now will be coming back to them six, nine months in saying let's talk about expansion and signature, because that's our land and expand model. But let's also start reminding you, one of the reasons you went with DocuSign was you were excited about that longer term vision of Agreement Cloud, and see that starting to play. So I think across that year, it'll be weighted towards the end of the year. But you'll see us in that nine, 12 months from today, with the winds were bringing in, looking for expansion opportunity for signature for all of them, and signature plus Agreement Cloud expansion for the mid market and larger customers. Yes. Nothing from me that's in a significant way. One of the things we started doing acquisitions two years ago, when we announced SpringCM and sort of the newer DocuSign, or at least within my time here coming up on four years, was saying, hey, guys, we're not going to become some massive acquisition machine. We want to do as smart deals that we can digest effectively. We want to have a very high batting average on successful deals. We've now done our third deal. To be honest, I would have thought we might have been a little bit of a wait before the third deal. The deal was not very large for bringing in the notary capability with Liveoak. But I feel good about the deal sizes we're doing. It's true with our balance sheet, we could probably open ourselves up to much larger deals economically, but we don't really think about it economically. We think about it from a customer success standpoint, what are our customers want, and fulfilling our vision of the Agreement Cloud. And one of the things that's tricky is, when turns up all the companies in the broadly defined Agreement Cloud, there aren't other DocuSign. There aren't other very large players. So I don't think there's a sort of a population of big deals that we would see at this point in time is being in that Agreement Cloud vision. Is it possible over time continue to grow and expand and become more expansionary than the Agreement Cloud, and then therefore look at maybe more significant size deals, I wouldn't rule that out. But as I look into what's visible, I feel really good about the strategy we have right now. The deals we're doing, I think, are high quality. They're on strategy for us. And I think if we look out into the possible future deals, they'll probably be more in that ballpark of size, because that's just the size of where companies are in the Agreement Cloud landscape. I don't know, Mike, if you have any different views, but I feel good about where we are right now. Let me talk a little bit about the sales productivity side. And Mike, you can talk about if you're willing to change our long term operating model on the call. Kash, I'm not sure, but we'll see. Your outgoing time as CFO, -- Cynthia a gift. My perspective is that, I think the success we've had in terms of sales productivity is to be really clear. It's been the secondary goal. The primary goal has been growth. And we told you, we want to continue to invest to achieve the -- growth. Now at the scale we've achieved, because we feel we see opportunity for productivity improvement. I'll tell you, it's not our focus. Our focus is still on meeting this significant demand opportunity. But just with that scale, it's sort of just comes to us. So my view is that we haven't done anything dramatically differently there. There's been a little bit of a focus that I've been pushing on to that team, to say, let's think about overlays. Let's think about complexity. As we grow this business, make sure we don't get so much complexity in the business, that we lose our ability to simply execute. And so I think that focus there on sort of simplification is probably having a nice little positive impact. And then scale is the other aspect that's driving the productivity there. In terms of that impact on the long term model, my starting point would be, we kind of forecast that this was going to happen. I think it's playing out pretty much consistently with the long term model and the path that Mike had built, but I'll give him the option. to comment on that, if he sees it differently. And again, my point of view is I think we're continuing to execute. Well, I think it's harder, quite frankly, doing everything in a remote environment. And I think it's taxing on our people. It's harder work for all of us. And to be blunt about it, I think we mostly like to get back into a situation where we are mostly able to be in the office, I think, though the world's changed a little bit. We probably have in the longer run, highly productive system, where some people are increasing, they're a little bit of time out of the office, because we've shown that we can still be productive in that environment  But from an efficiency standpoint, I think we'd actually be now even more efficient if we could be back in the office and have some of those collaboration benefits. From the standpoint of translate to the financial results, again, I don't think there's anything that's played out in these financials that I would say, accelerated efficiency, because of remote work. I suppose the only thing I would point to as sort of an obvious is that we don't have the T&E expense. And that has been somewhat of improvement. But we've actually spent some of those savings on other things, both funding growth, as well as supporting our employees in terms of things like helping them with a DocuSign cares program, helping them set up in a home office in a way that allows them to be productive at home. I don't have anything else about it. That would seem different to me from that standpoint. I don't know if you, Mike to add. Thank you very much. And I really appreciate you all being here today. Its been the fantastic quarter. And we will look forward to seeing you, mostly likely seeing you through video in the coming months until we see you next quarter. And just then one last comment, I'd like to thank Mike again for his incredible leadership over five years of stewarding the financial ship here. And I can't tell you how excited I am to look forward as we built the international business together. Thank you all."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks Anne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. For today's call, I will share updates and context around three primary topics. First, the company's business performance and financial results for the quarter; second, the ways that COVID-19 has led customers to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives for agreements; and third, our views on the future based on the best data we have today.  Before I get to that though, I want to acknowledge just how much life has changed since our last call. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally shifted the global macroeconomic environment and impacted countless lives around the world. We've seen all manner of private, public, and nonprofit organizations step up to help, and I'd like to take this opportunity to personally think all the first responders, healthcare workers, medical researchers, and local leaders who have made such a difference to the lives of so many. At DocuSign, we've done what we can to step up too, both in our initial response to the pandemic and as we all continue to adapt to this evolving impact. For safety reasons, in early March, we transitioned our more than 4,000 employees across 15 countries to remote work environment. We offered $1,300 in assistance to employees for tools and services to help ease that transition. Then we offered additional programs and assistance to streamline the process even further. We also mobilize resources to handle a surge in urgent needs from our customers. In some cases, this meant directly supporting COVID-19 responses by government agencies, healthcare organizations, and those on the front line. In others, it meant helping organizations to keep their business processes running while their workforce has transitioned to remote work. I'll give you specific examples later, but suffice it to say that over this time, we had a lot coming at us to make this transition while maintaining the highest levels of platform availability, customer service, and remote onboarding all while facing unprecedented levels of customer demand is nothing short of exceptional. I'd like to salute the truly extraordinary efforts of the DocuSign team for their agility and commitment to our customer\u2019s success. Now this collective effort is reflected in our Q1 results. Our Billings grew 59% year-over-year to $342 million, and revenue grew 39% to $297 million. This strong growth was driven by used case expansion across a broad cross section of our installed base, as well as adoption by new customers. We added more than 10,000 net new direct customers and almost 58,000 self service customers, bringing our global total of paying customers to nearly 661,000. And our operating margins and cash flow remained strong, even as we made key investments to address this heightened demand. Much of the strong Q1 performance was driven by increased demand for a signature from organizations that suddenly needed a way to sign and manage agreements from wherever they were. Typically, eSignature is the first step that many customers take on their broader digital transformation journey with us. So, from a financial point-of-view, we believe this surge in eSignature adoption bodes well for future Agreement Cloud expansion. Now, let me share some examples of how we've helped our customers respond to COVID-19 and keep their agreement prophecies up and running amid the pandemic. We worked closely with a global pharmaceutical company to accelerate its eSignature expansion to hundreds of use cases across 80 different countries. This is a pattern that we saw many times over the quarter. A customer already had a plan to expand and COVID-19 greatly accelerated it. We engaged a new public sector customer, the Department of Labor in one of the largest U.S. states to help transform its previously complex and lengthy process for handling emergency unemployment benefits. Supported by DocuSign eSignature, the department distributed over $500 million in benefits to more than 500,000 residents in less than one week. We enabled hundreds of U.S. national and regional financial institutions to accept applications for small business administration loans more efficiently. At one of those large banks, we were involved with over 0.5 million loan applications, 75% of which were signed in less than 24 hours. We worked with a regional telecom provider using DocuSign Intelligent Insights, which is our contract analytics tool to analyze potential pandemic-related risks in thousands of their supplier contracts. Finally, we helped the European telemedicine provider issue e-prescriptions and online sick leave certificates by using our video identification capability to confirm the patients' identities. These are just a few examples. You can find many more on our dedicated COVID-19 web page. Let me speak briefly about where we see things going from here. Well, no one is 100% sure what the world will look like. It's clear that the ways of doing business are changing. Remote work is here to stay, core business processes will only become more digital, and agreements will need to be completed from anywhere at any time on almost any device. As a result, for organizations that hadn't already embraced DocuSign for eSignature where they were only using us for a few select use cases, the pandemic has been a catalyst for the greater digital transformation of their end-to-end agreement processes. We always believed this transformation will happen and that a unifying platform for agreements will be needed. COVID-19 is just happening faster. That said, even when the COVID-19 situation is behind us, we don't anticipate customers returning to paper or manual based processes. Once they take their first digital transformation steps with us, and they realize the time, cost, and customer experience benefits, they rarely go back.  So, in short, we expect the adoption of our core eSignature offering by new customers, and the expansion of use cases by existing ones to continue. This also acts as the on ramp for the adoption of other agreement cloud products, sometimes at the same time, and sometimes as follow-ons. Of course, as Mike will tell you, we are not immune to the broader economic forces at play. Some businesses and industries will continue to contract, some will continue to expand, some of our customers may request payment deferral and accommodations, and some will require even more hands-on support and assistance. Even with these dynamics, our view of the business remains optimistic. We're off to a good start in the second quarter as digital transformation remains a high priority. We feel truly fortunate to have built solutions that can help customers carry on through this time of crisis, and to deliver even greater value as we transition to a world where work becomes more digital and more remote. In the meantime, we will continue to do whatever we can, wherever we can to help our customers succeed. With that, I'd like to hand over to Mike to walk us through the financials in more detail and I'll talk to you again when we get to the Q&A. Mike?\nMike Sheridan: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dan mentioned, the worldwide shift to remote work has accelerated digital transformations across organizations and has resulted in unprecedented levels of demand for DocuSign products. We believe this accelerated growth in new customers and expansion within our installed base was driven by a sudden prioritization of our products, but we also believe that these customers will remain with us because they are realizing the value that our solutions deliver in any working environment.  Strong sales led by our eSignature solutions drove a 59% year-over-year increase in first quarter billings to $342 million. This growth also drove a 39% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $297 million in the first quarter. Subscription revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $281 million. We saw similar strength outside the U.S., as total international revenue grew over 46% year-over-year to $55 million. This quarter, we added almost 68,000 new customers. Of those, approximately 10,000 were direct customers, an increase of 43% year-over-year. This brings our total customer base to nearly 661,000 worldwide, with roughly 89,000 direct customers. These totals include a catch up adjustment of 4,000 direct customers related to review in reconciliation of prior year customer acquisitions. Strong eSignature expansions and upsells into our existing customer base led to dollar net retention of 119% in the quarter. Customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 46% year-over-year, to a total of 473 customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 79%, consistent with a year ago. Subscription gross margin was 84%, compared with 86% a year ago. Margins were impacted by investments we made in our data center capacity, particularly for hosted services to ensure our ability to meet significantly higher transaction volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses total $210 million, or 71% of total revenue in the quarter, compared with $160 million, or 75% of total revenue in Q1 of last year. To address current demand and prepare for future growth, we pulled forward some of our sales capacity hires and expanded our marketing efforts, leading to higher sales and marketing expenses in the quarter.  Additionally, to help ease the transition to remote work after closing our offices in early March, we've provided employee stipends for virtual workspaces and other COVID related expenses. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the recent pandemic. We generated $23 million in non-GAAP operating profit or an 8% operating margin in the quarter. This compares with $10 million or 5% operating margin in the first quarter of last year. Non-GAAP net income was $24 million in the first quarter, compared with $13 million in the first quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 4,281 employees, an increase of 33% over the first quarter of last year. Operating cash flow in the first quarter increased almost 30% year-over-year to $59 million, compared with $46 million in the same quarter a year ago. CapEx increased during the quarter due to leasehold improvements and expansions to our existing offices, as well as the scaling of our federal data center. Free cash flow came in at $33 million, compared with $30 million a year ago. Now, let me turn to guidance. We anticipate that total revenue will range between $316 million and $320 million in Q2, and $1.313 billion to $1.317 billion for fiscal 2021. Of this total, we expect subscription revenue of $298 million to $302 million in Q2, and $1.243 billion to $1.247 billion for fiscal 2021. For billings, we expect $333 million to $343 million in Q2, and $1.515 billion to $1.535 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q2 and fiscal 2021. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing expense in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues for Q2, and 47% to 49% for fiscal 2021. We expect R&D expense in the range of 14% to 16% for Q2, and 13% to 15% for fiscal 2021. And we expect G&A expense in the range of 9% to 11% for both Q2 and fiscal 2021. For the second quarter, we expect $2 million to $3 million of non-GAAP interest and other non-operating income. And for fiscal 2021, we expect $8 million to $12 million of non-GAAP interest and non-operating income. We expect a tax provision of approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million for Q2 and $6 million to $10 million for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding up 200 million to 205 million shares for Q2 and fiscal 2021. As a reminder, we closed the Seal acquisition on May 1. So, all of the guidance I just provided includes the anticipated impact of Seal. Since we anticipate that Seal will add less than 1% to our top line performance, we don't expect it to impact our near-term growth rates. Costs and operating expenses related to the Seal business are also a small part of our total expenses. However, we expect in the near term that they will have a small dilutive effect on our growth and operating margins. Thanks for joining us today. And now we will open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi guys, glad everybody's safe and healthy. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of vertical industry volumes or maybe percentage of revenue, you know, is this primarily focused on a few key industries like finance or are you seeing broad spread increase in adoption?\nDan Springer : I think it\u2019s fairly broad. You know, we don't have any one industry that is, you know, a significant portion. We have a lot of strong industries and some of those like financial services did particularly well, like the specific example I gave around the SBA loans, Sterling. We also saw a lot of strength in Healthcare and Life Sciences. We also saw the government sector being very strong as a lot of folks had that phenomenon we described. They knew at some point they were going to have to do more digital transformation to their business and COVID-19 has accelerated it. So, we see that being very broad. Obviously, there's some industries to think about, particularly hospitality and travel that we see that have, you know, been weakened industries, and some of those, so to continue running their business need to run on DocuSign. So, we haven't seen, you know, some sort of collapse or anything, but we would see less growth in those segments that are hit harder, and that's kind of how we're seeing it across the board. \nSterling Auty: Great. And then one quick follow up. You mentioned investment in capacity. Can you give us a sense of what capacity utilization the DocuSign platform system is and perhaps what additional investments might be necessary to keep up with the increasing volume?\nMike Sheridan: Yes, Sterling. I think when we're talking about capacity, it's a couple of things. First of all, in terms of our capacity to manage volumes, we have plenty of headroom. We've always remained well ahead of the curve and ensuring that our capacity is ahead of the volumes that we're seeing. And even when we had spikes with COVID, we have data that demonstrates that we were very safely above any capacity constraints. You know, when we look at capacity, to \u2013 that could impact things like our gross margins, expanding our customer support organization is an example, our customer success organization is an example to deal with issues that come up there. You know, some of our hosted bandwidth for Canada and for Australia, where we don't have our own proprietary data centers, transaction volumes can have an impact there. But overall, I think we entered Q2 very comfortable that we put ourselves in a position to deal with whatever transaction other [ph] volumes are going to materialize.\nSterling Auty: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats. That was a phenomenal billings number and acceleration in NDRR. So, congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to touch on sort of a more structurally complex question, I guess, when you think about \u2013 the eSignature product is great, when you think about sort of real estate and some of the fairly straightforward concepts, but you're seeing a lot more complex workflow. I guess, I'd love to understand, A, when you think about the complex workflows, what do you find are the most exciting ones, the sticky ones, the ones that will continue over time? And then sort of as you think about that, is that driven by you or is it driven by people who are building really complex workflows like the notary parts, not having a notary in person for a mortgage or something like that, but the cottage industry has developed around DocuSign?\nDan Springer: Well, I'll give you a couple thoughts. You know, on that, I think the first piece is, we get most excited when people build workflows that integrate with our software and leverage API's, and almost two-thirds of the transactions that occur on our platform are not from someone going into our web or mobile interface and creating a document to be signed or for that matter, in a CLM framework, a document to be routed around and managed. It's from people who are actually building integrations to their systems and that can be the pre-built integrations we have with SAP and Salesforce.com and Workday, other great SaaS businesses, and it could be -- APIs they've integrated themselves using our developer tools. So, those are the ones that we get most excited about, because they as you indicated are the stickiest. And the second dimension that I would think about it is, we get really excited about the situations where, as I said, people sort of, run their business on DocuSign. So, if those are back office use cases where they might be managing their financial processes and their PO processes, and all of those get integrated to those back office tools into DocuSign, that's great. But also on the front office situations, particularly, and you mentioned real estate, when you see something like a mortgage product or our digital rooms product, and there's multiple players involved. So, whether or not they're all using API calls, but there's multiple individuals that need to have an agreement routed around to them, and those front office use cases can then sometimes be quite complex, leverage the functionality and the capability we've built, very sticky because the ROI is so high for companies and so important that they have a great customer experience, which is why we get such a high net promoter score because our customers' customers like using DocuSign with our customers. So those would be the two dimensions I would point to that I think we're most focused on when we talk about building those deeper integrated use cases.\nBhavan Suri: That was very helpful, thank you. And then one quick follow up here. Obviously, there was the PPP program and things like that. You alluded to some of these sort of one-time events. Now obviously, offset by maybe lower mortgage applications, right, because of the environment, but is there a way to give us some color of how much you feel like part of the business that grow that billings toward sort of a one-time aspect, and again offset by a decline with this regular rate business? But just trying to understand sort of what that one-time bump might have been if you've got any color around that.\nMike Sheridan: Yeah, there definitely will be some examples that are used cases that are more project-oriented or one-time in nature. We see that as the extreme minority. What we really saw was that companies largely had either begun with us and had not gotten to scale or were thinking of moving on to DocuSign, but it wasn't as high on the hierarchy list of these other priorities. And the recent events pushed us up that priority list and also accelerated some of the scale that our existing customers were experiencing. So there was the effect of recent events and the coronavirus that maybe brought some of that demand to us. As I mentioned in my script, we believe strongly that it will stay with us because the value proposition that we're selling is the same and what they're realizing from that value proposition is going to apply to work-from-home environment, but it's also going to extend to whatever our remote working or in-office working looks like in the future.\nBhavan Suri: Awesome. Thank you, guys, and congrats again.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Yeah, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could expand a little bit around the federal sector and I know you've been building up the data center for a couple of quarters, which is cost CapEx, but in terms of where it ranks now in terms of verticals and really where this opportunity could go over the next couple of years.\nDan Springer: Yeah, absolutely. And I think government overall is an important vertical for us, although, as I mentioned before, it's no one vertical, is a dramatic portion of our revenue and we don't see government overall in the top couple, but it is an important and growing segment nonetheless. I mentioned some of the examples I gave around government, if you think about the state and local segments in the state example I gave around the health and human services side and people doing processing of emergency needs to get unemployment benefits of folks, we saw that as a very strong quarter for us and we've had a lot of momentum there. Federal have been newer for us and because part of that was getting the FedRAMP certification that was required to serve a lot of folks, and now we're building the dedicated data center as you referred to, which will unlock another set of opportunities for us with different federal agencies. But we also \u2013 have also mentioned before and we see this as well that even in a COVID-19 situation, we may see that some aspects of the federal government still moves a little bit more slowly than some of the other private sector in terms of adoption of digital technologies. So, we will be a patient provider to them as a customer. And I think from a long term perspective, we continue to see this as a dramatic growth opportunity.\nRob Owens: Great. And then second for Mike. Your day\u2019s billings outstanding has been running a little higher I guess over the last couple of quarters than the three prior. Just curious if this is just deal sizes getting larger, so payment terms are getting extended, was there anything relative to concessions for customers in the quarter, given the pandemic? Thanks.\nMike Sheridan: Yeah. So, Rob, I think when we track it internally, then we can align and go through that which I think our DBO's have actually been pretty stable. That said, we remain disciplined around not extending payment terms as we get larger and maintain good healthy deal dynamics around that. Did we get some inbound requests for slower payment? We did, and it was more or less anecdotal, but when it came in, we were responsive to it, especially if you have smaller businesses that were a bit cash-strapped, we tried to be responsive to that. What we wouldn't do is, we weren't changing the underlying contract terms, but we are allowing our collections organization to give more latitude and back off when companies needed a little more room. So, there was some of that in the quarter. It didn't really change major trends in our cash flows, but I think if we see some of that materialize in the coming quarters, we'll respond in a similar way.\nRob Owens: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pat Walravens from JMP. Please proceed with your question.\nPat Walravens: Oh, great. Thank you. One for each of you, if that's okay. Mike, for you first, I'm just wondering how much of the growth \u2013 I know you don't actually give this out, but some context would be great. How much of the revenue growth comes from the self-service channel? And, because if I look at that, I mean your number of direct customers went sort of from 6,000 to 10,000 from Q4 to Q1, but the self-service went from 21,000 last quarter to 58,000 and the context there, as I'm sure you listened to yesterday is that Zoom's guidance is pretty flat versus having this massive Q1 because of their concern that those smaller customers who signed up for Zoom might churn off as we open back up. So, I'd just love to hear your perspective on that.\nMike Sheridan: Yeah, let me start on the churn perspective. We don't think that our situation is analogous to Zoom's volumes and so forth. As I mentioned previously, we believe that, of course, our business, like any, has churn. We think it's going to remain pretty stable because we think that the value propositions, again, we're delivering are sustainable, whether it's a work-from-home environment or not. In terms of contribution from our e-commerce platform, our self-service business in Q2 was about 12% or 13%, which is pretty consistent with what it has been in and out. Remember that the significant majority of our customers come to us through e-commerce, albeit that they represent a relatively small percentage of our revenue. But there's two really important dynamics of that. There\u2019s some critical verticals that are serviced in there. Verticals like real estate. It's a source for many of our customers when they first engaged with us to then graduate to move up to a direct relationship with us. And it's also a major driver of brand and awareness for our products. So, while it's a relatively smaller percentage of our top-line, it's a critical element of the overall model.\nPat Walravens: That was super helpful. And then, Dan, for you, just sort of around why it takes so long to adopt something? So, you mentioned mortgages, we just refinanced our mortgage and incredibly at the end of the process, a very nice notary came to our house with a mask on and gloves and met us in the backyards, where we had masks on and gloves, and handed us 50 pages that we signed with our own pens. And this bank is one of your customers. Right? And so they're using it in some parts, but for whatever reason, they aren't using it for the mortgages. So, why not lift the challenge there? It seems like such an obvious used case. Why isn't everyone using DocuSign for their mortgage? Thanks.\nDan Springer: I ask the banks that question every day, Pat. That's, as you imagine, something we pose to them as well. I think the reality is, there's two things that I would point to that stop adoption where the consumer proposition is so high. As an example, you just said with the need for a remote model for notary and I think they really come in two buckets. The first one is this perceived regulation and we see a lot of times, companies will say, yeah, that's not legal here, it's not allowed, and of course, it probably is, but it's just practice and people have done something for a long time. We see this with some of the attorneys in the legal profession who use \u2013 do a lot of contracts and agreements and they'll say, oh yeah, we love DocuSign, but we can't do it for these types of contracts. Often times they're incorrect. They just don't \u2013 they don't understand that. And then the second thing that I think occurs is, we have the \u2013 on the consumer side is changing that behavior and that's sort of the organization needs to change, whether it's the company or the end consumer and change in management is not trivial. We see that a lot in back-office situations where, as an example, if you're using and your HR department is on-boarding employees, and they're used to doing that by sending offer letters in the mail, filling out I-9's in person when people would show up, and one of the things that's great about COVID-19 is we realized people like to on-board employees without doing that. And so the offer letters now are going out with DocuSign and the I-9 can be done remotely. And so, I think it's just one by one. We kind of have to hit each of those barriers that are usually perceived not real from a legality standpoint. And on the notary side, I'll just give you a last comment. I mean, that's an area we see as a big growth area for us and we believe we're going to be, in the coming quarters, talking a lot more about how we want to expand on the capability to meet our customers' needs across a variety of solutions to make notary easier for people, but that's \u2013 I think those are the reality of things that we face as the hurdles to driving that adoption.\nPat Walravens: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions and I hope everyone's staying safe out there. Wanted to start by just drilling down a little bit more on the billings. Obviously, a really impressive billings number and nice acceleration. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on what drove that, and given the guidance, that calls for what looks to be a little bit of a decel in Q2 and then a little bit of an acceleration from the back half of the year. Was there any kind of pull forward of billings that you expected in Q2 that got into Q1? Just any kind of color in bridging these together would be helpful. And then I've got a follow-up.\nMike Sheridan: Yeah. So, a couple of things. One of the exciting parts of Q1 was we had a lot of things contributing to that growth. We had, as you heard, large growth in direct new customers. We had 10,000 in the quarter. We also had really strong expansion inside the installed base. Our dollar net retention hit the high end of our range to 119%. So, we really saw strength across all those primary growth areas. I think if you look at the cadence between quarters, I've always talked about, look at the billings statistic as a rolling four quarter average as opposed to a particular data point. I think if you look at last year's Q1, as you recall, it was a little bit lower. If you look at last year's Q2 it was pretty strong. So, you'll see some of that dynamic impact the percentage. Overall, again, if you look at it on an average basis over the course of the year, I think the growth is pretty correlated to the underlying growers in the business. So, those are what's really contributing to it. Obviously, in Q1, the suddenness of people having to change their work habits is a single data point that we wouldn't want to draw a trend line through that single data point too aggressively, but we are entering Q2, continuing to see a good start. So, we're incorporating all of that into the guidance that I gave you.\nRishi Jaluria: Great, that's helpful. And then kind of a little bit of a follow-up. It seems like among other trends that you're benefiting from, one of them would be not just work-from-home, but the longer lasting one of companies kind of having travel bans and more contract agreements and negotiations being done virtually and that's probably longer lasting than kind of work-from-home. So, I wanted to get a sense, A, is that something that you're seeing as a big driver and more so on the broader Agreement Cloud versus solely eSignature? And then, B, is that something that you're seeing as being a little bit more temporary in nature and maybe some of that benefit starts to dissipate as the travel bans go away or is this a major process change that you're viewing as more irreversible, so you're seeing it as maybe more sticky and long lasting? Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yeah, it is. I actually think we think about work-from-home and the travel restriction in a very similar way. I think we believe that there is quite a lot of change that's going to occur. We see it, by the way, in our own companies. We start thinking about coming back into the office and how we want to safely bring our employees back. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, all 4,000-plus of our employees are working from home now. And we think that things have changed sort of forever and we talk about this among our executive staff when we meet now that we're rethinking how we think about travel and we're rethinking about which jobs we believe need to be in an office or always in an office. So, I think we're going to see that the need for people to do their agreements, as you said, not just the signatures, but the overall agreement processes from remote settings is going to be real and increased. But as we like to think about it is, that might be the impetus for people to, for the first time, say, \u2018This is the way I need to manage my business today; I don't have the ability to do manual paper-based processes in offices,\u2019 but then when they see the cost savings, the time savings and the better experience, I think they're going to look at it and say, \u2018I want all of my business process to run this way.\u2019 And even if some of the work-from-home and some of the travel mitigates, those restrictions mitigate, which I do believe they will, I don't think it'll be completely back to the old normal, but I think it'll be somewhat. The need to have those digital services are going to be just as strong and they will maintain that usage. So, that's kind of how we see that developing.\nRishi Jaluria: Great, that's really helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much and congratulations on a very strong quarter. A couple of questions from my end, first one on the \u2013 just what you saw in the quarter and maybe help us to bifurcate that between strength within the core eSignature versus strength within the SpringCM CLM solution and the broader Agreement Cloud. And then how are you thinking about that moving forward through the rest of the year? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nDan Springer: Well, so I think one of the things that we saw was the dramatic portion of the acceleration that we wouldn't have seen pre-COVID- 19 was signature-centric and that's for a couple of reasons. One, the ROI on eSignature is so incredibly high. So people have always found that when they have that opportunity to find solutions that can meet, it's a great answer for folks. And so I think we saw a lot of people say, this is a great opportunity for you to be smart about where I run my business. The second thing is when you think about your overall Agreement Cloud work, eSignature tends to be the entry point. One of the reasons we built such as signature business of scale, before we broadened to the other Agreement Cloud, it's just a starting point for most people. And in fact, if we think about the broader CLM capability, if you don't have digital agreements with digital signatures on them, it's hard to think about a digital solution for managing your contracts and agreement. So, you really go the other way first. So, we think that absolutely will happen. And then the second phenomenon is that because we saw that the need for remote work and for people to be able to get these transactions, both internal ones, as well as external ones with customers, managed when people are working from home, there was, again, an urgency to get a lot of those eSignature projects up and running and CLM, interestingly enough, tends to be a longer sales cycle. It's \u2013 usually a statement of work is involved, some sort of systems integration or professional services involved. And I think we're seeing across the software world, the slightly more complex projects that are a little larger in initial scope, less land and expand, and more one bigger entry point, are the ones that are going to face a little pushback and delays. And so from a standpoint of the time to close those deals, those times would extend a little bit. So, that's why we saw eSignature being particularly strong in the quarter. When we look out over the next several quarters, we see that phenomenon will dissipate over time. Some of the deals that might elongate from a Q1 into a Q2 and then some into a Q3, you'll continue to see some of those pushing forward into those later quarters, which will give us tailwinds there, but most importantly is, all these new eSignature wins, if you think about those 10,000 direct customers that came in, significant portion of those came in with eSignature and in the quarters ahead, they're going to be our most fertile opportunity to cross-sell and expand their overall Agreement Cloud solution.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. That makes sense and you started the call with really outlining the momentum that you're seeing across your business, across the industries and government is one of the ones that you mentioned. How are you thinking about the federal vertical as you get into the back half of the year with the federal purchasing \u2013 the federal fiscal year coming up? Is that an opportunity to perhaps close more business than you initially expected as you entered the year? That's it for me. Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yeah. Stan, I think we're pretty bullish as we talked about earlier in the call. I think we're very bullish about the government vertical. And to your specific question around timing of the year, remember, because our core business and eSignature is still the significant biggest part of what we bring to the government, is more of a land and expand model. We don't have the same phenomenon that you might see in some other software companies where it's all about getting that end of the year contract done, whether it's a big sales cycle that maybe goes for a couple of years and then trying to get a big splash at the end of the year. We tend to see it happening more evenly across the year. So sometimes there's a budget cycle opportunity for us around something like a CLM deal and we saw that, remember last year where we had the VA discussion where we had sort of a very large deal, but most of our government work, and specifically from the federal here, really does occur in the land and expand model with lots of small expansions that we build over time.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect, thank you and congrats on a great quarter.\nDan Springer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. And maybe just to start, Dan, and following up on the earlier question on the CLM side, you mentioned that obviously eSignature is the landing spot for most of your customers that come in. How long does the sort of [that relationship that suggest that] before you can start talking to them in a bigger way about CLM or some of the more or sort of maybe more complicated services around the Agreement Cloud? Meaning, if this cohort comes in this quarter, obviously, in a big way, is it six, nine months? I'm sure it differs on companies in terms of their sophistication, but I'm just \u2013 do you have any general thoughts on how that's trended at least over the last year in terms of when you start to see that upsell opportunity?\nDan Springer: Yeah. So it's really interesting, and Kirk, at the time of our IPO, one of the things we talked about when we had less broad of an Agreement Cloud set of offerings, but we had the phenomena of the land and expand and we shared some customer stories, where we had some customers that started off very small with us and over a series of six years had grown into very large businesses, but there wasn't, sort of, necessarily an inflection point. There was a lot of small additional adds. Now in the signature-only world, that's what I would expect. As you think about the broader Agreement Cloud, to your question, we are likely going to have scenarios where we do get a signature land. We continue to add additional used cases and expansion of eSignature, but also make a very large Agreement Cloud splash with the customer. And I think that can happen in that sort of three, four quarters time period, where it have a chance to implement signature, get that early success and win and the organization gets excited about DocuSign and we come back to really start working on the Agreement Cloud. Keep in mind that some of those other components do have a longer sales cycle and implementation. So, even if within one or two quarters of a land with eSignature, if someone expressed a lot of interest to a broader, let's say, a CLM solution, it would probably be several quarters from then before we got the sale done, got the statement of work in place and you see that showing up as DocuSign revenue. So, I don't think you should think about it as quick kick. We should think about that as a nice elongated revenue growth path for us to go into. That's sort of how I would generally think about the opportunity for us to do that expansion. And the only other thing I would just add, though, is that when I look at our opportunity around the Agreement Cloud, the clear obvious thing to point to, as Mike talked about, is over \u2013 well over 600,000 customers. The majority of those are signature-only. That's really the cross-sell opportunity. So, it's not like we're thinking about the CLM sale opportunity and saying, well, we can't go talk to someone for CLM other than the people that joined last quarter eSignature. We've got years of signature customers that are sort of a pent-up opportunity for us to bring the Agreement Cloud and that's where we're really focus today.\nKirk Materne: That's really helpful. And thanks for the color on that. The other question I had was, you're obviously with 10,000 new direct customers this quarter. It's a really nice job by your sales team being able to process that many deals, frankly. Were a lot of those sort of incremental deals that came in were they in the pipeline that kind of maybe came earlier? Were there a lot out of, kind of, left field that was just a really quick sales process? Can you just give us some color on that, maybe not the direct number, but when you think about it, how you're able to kind of accomplish that? It seems \u2013 obviously, again, kudos to your sales team, I was just kind of curious how many of those might have already been your early stage relationships that accelerated versus customers that had never even talked to you before they jumped on?\nDan Springer: Yeah. Let me give you a couple of thoughts and Mike might have some additional perspective as well. But the answer, as is the case with a lot of things at DocuSign, is all of the above. We're such an unusual company that we serve from the smallest customers up to the absolute largest customers across all verticals, across the variety of geographies, selling in over 150 countries. So, we are very broad and that's exactly what happened here. We had a good solid pipeline of business that had nothing to do with COVID-19 that would have set us up for a solid quarter in Q1 and a lot of those deals and process that we would expect to have happened and our sales team executed across those. We also had, to the nature of your question, some additional much faster timeline deals where people came to us and said, \"I really need to get going with DocuSign, I've always known that, but I just haven't gotten around to doing it.\" So some of those were people who had conversations going on with us and those accelerated, and some in that whole cycle was done within the quarter where someone called us and said, \"You need to help me get up to speed quickly\". Some of the healthcare opportunities were big. If you think about the situation where you're trying to \u2013 you're now trying to do COVID-19 testing and you've never been an organization that did that kind of testing before, and now you say, \"I got to figure out a way to get people's information and get them to fill out forms, Oh! But I don't want to touch them, I don't want to touch anything they've touched, I also need a digital solution for doing that.\" And we had sales cycles that happened in that in a matter of days, where people came to us, explained that business need that they had, or that healthcare need that they had and we were able to get up and running that used case. So there really was quite a range across each of those pieces.\nMike Sheridan: Yeah, the one other piece to that question that you brought up that I think is important is if you imagine back in March when we very suddenly had to close our offices and send 4,000 people home, at that very same time, we had a dramatic increase in our demand and we had a process that if we talked about transactions earlier on our infrastructure, you mentioned the sales teams, there's the Rev ops team that has to process that increased quantity from location that they're not used to working. All of those things together, it really tested our environment and one of the things that came out of Q1, very happy about is, it was a very resilient environment even with some of the pressures put upon us to have to change how we were doing our business.\nKirk Materne: That's really helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Two questions. Just the first one on the new business versus expansion, is it safe to say you were seeing smaller new contracts as people just try to get up and running and that leaves more of an expansion opportunity on those or do you see the reverse as people sort of understood that this is the way things are headed? Just curious how to factor in what you saw this quarter in terms of calibrating our expectations around expansion in the next few quarters?\nMike Sheridan: Yeah. Hi, Walter. Yeah, so a couple of things. I think one of the great strengths that we've talked a lot about with DocuSign is we sell to the very smallest businesses in our self-service e-commerce world, we sell to the Fortune 10 and we have strength selling into the mids and the majors and the small businesses direct through commercial. So, if we looked at the broad growth that we had over the course of the quarter, we talked a little bit before that there will be some anecdotal things around PPP or other project based use cases, but if you look beyond that at the overall growth, Dan sort of touched upon how it's spread across verticals.  It's spread across those segments as well. It really did, and it was a nice combination of new direct, as well as expansion of scale within the installed base. So, it was broad. Within there, there is going to be some pockets, travel and entertainment might be one pocket, it wasn't as strong, you might look at healthcare, life sciences that showed a bit more strength than the common quarter. But when I went back and looked at the complexion of the growth, it was nice and broad-based.\nDan Springer: And then to your deal size, very specific question, when Mike and I do a review, which we just did two days ago, we look at our pricing and we look at what's different in terms of quarter-to-quarter, in terms of how people are buying from us and what the nature of those deals look like, there wasn't anything in this quarter that would suggest larger deal sizes on average even within the segments that Mike was just walking you through. So, I don't think there was anything notable. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that when we talk about our land to expand opportunity, it's so significant but it's hard for me to imagine, Walter, that there could be some dramatic change in that initial land that would change the kind of upsell our long term expansion opportunity because it's such a big multiple of our typical initial land. So, I wouldn't expect anything different than our typical great growth opportunity from that going forward.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay, got it. And then, just curious how you're thinking about sales cycles. If they permanently change or \u2013 obviously there's been a lot of awareness created in the market for your brand and so forth. Curious if you've adjusted all in terms of your forecasting this year, maybe longer-term, the sort of sales cycles, more in the enterprise, the larger customer segment.\nDan Springer: I don't think we see anything that we would call a significant change from that standpoint. I think the phenomenon in Q1 that we alluded to earlier, was that there were some increase in sales cycles for some deals because of the urgency of those used cases. I think that will probably revert to the mean over time. And then to your point about does the DocuSign sell get easier as we become more prominent around the brand, I suppose there could be something there incrementally. I don't have anything I could point to yet to tell you we have observed something. And I can clearly tell you we're not changing at this point our expectations or our plans for our cycles. Again, by segment, as Mike said, different for each segment, but we don't have anything at this point that we would point to and say within a segment we think the sales cycles would be different going forward.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Ives from Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Ives: Yeah, thanks. Can you hit on international in terms of the opportunities there, obviously, lot of strength this quarter and maybe some of the different dynamics, when you think international versus domestic in terms of what you're seeing?\nMike Sheridan: Yeah, hi, Daniel. So, a couple of things. As I mentioned in my script, International grew 46% year-over-year. So, we continue to see a really strong contribution from that part of our business. I think as we've talked in the past, some of those markets, large markets like a Germany, a France and so forth that are civil law countries are in a bit of an earlier stage than what we've seen domestically, but each quarter, we're continuing to see improvements in those major markets. And I also mentioned before that some of the infrastructure we have around how we structure data centers and so forth, we've built into those markets as they expand, so markets like Australia and like Canada, that may be a bit earlier. We're going to leverage infrastructure like Azure to address those, but overall, we look at those markets, it's a significant part of our TAM. We are seeing evidence that the needs of customers in those regions are the same as the needs that we're servicing in the U.S. and that continues to drive a huge opportunity for us that we're investing aggressively in.\nDaniel Ives: Great. And just on eSignature, are you finding that you are in an enterprise within the department and maybe two departments and now just going enterprise-wide? Is that \u2013 I mean maybe you could just drill into that trend relative to this COVID environment in terms of the acceleration specifically on the eSignature going from the departments to enterprise-wide?\nDan Springer: Yeah, I don't think we've seen anything particularly from COVID that would accelerate that move where we work with one or two divisions and now we get more of an enterprise solution other than the same macro piece we talked about, which is, as companies are increasingly seeing the need to drive the digital transformation, that's accelerating. It probably, at the same rate, would accelerate those expansions from divisional projects to broader enterprise-wide solutions, but I think, at this point, we'd say, that phenomenon is occurring. It's always been a big growth opportunity for us and I think it's the same big growth opportunity for us going forward, but I don't think COVID acceleration of digital transformation is going to change that phenomenon or that rate at which we see that going, other than just making everything go a little bit faster.\nDaniel Ives: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes, thank you very much. So, your sub gross margins, it looks like they declined by about 2 points year-to-year. I think in your script, you said that you had increased hosting costs. Can you talk about the recovery in sub gross margins you see going forward?\nMike Sheridan: Yeah. So, probably the biggest contributor to that is the addition of CLM to the business and some of the costs associated with that business that aren't as leveraged as our scaled eSignature business. If you look at our long-term target model, it stayed the same at 78% to 82%. And I think that what will allow us to remain in that range and the increase in that range, overall, both in terms of subscriptions and professional services, is really just going to be continued to scale. So, if you look at Seal, is another example. Seal, as I mentioned in my comments, is going to have a near term small dilutive effect on gross margins as well just because their top-line contribution won't match the infrastructure we're bringing over as part of that acquisition, but those are near term and they're fairly minor and I remain guiding that 78% to 82% for gross margins for our long-term model.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. One more, your dollar net retention rate is now 119%, which is at the high-end of your targeted 112% to 119%. What do you see going forward in that rate?\nMike Sheridan: Yes. So, at this point, I'm really not changing the range. I don't foresee us being anywhere near the lower side of that range. I think if we remain in that range, we continue to drive a healthy outcome in the business. If we see something more sustainable over time, we'll always reconsider it and look at that, but for now we're keeping the range the same.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Taylor McGinnis from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nTaylor McGinnis: Hi, and congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. The billings growth rate, of course, is super strong, but I would just be curious if you feel the level of usage you saw in the DocuSign platform in the quarter is fully reflected in that number. And by that, I mean, maybe you could talk about the process of true-ups and overages and what happens when a customer needs more envelopes, because before the second half billings guidance implied low-30s and now it implies mid-30s. So, I'm just wondering if some of the usage that we potentially saw in the quarter is embedded into renewals as well.\nMike Sheridan: So, Taylor, couple of things, first, one thing that we don't do much of, very little of, is we're not a model that has a lot of billings for overages. We look at opportunities where customers who have exceeded their capacity or their subscription is the time to go back and upsell them in an early renewal. So, the volume of transactions aren't necessarily going to correlate to near-term billings trends, which you'll see over time, however, as they are the customers who've talked about a lot to adopt their capacity and it becomes part of their business. Then that drives that dollar net retention, that up-sell opportunity and that expansion opportunity in the future, but in the near term, if you're looking at how much of Q1 billings was affected by our going back to customers and billing them for overages, it's very, very small.\nTaylor McGinnis: Got it. And then maybe just a second question, could you maybe talk about the Conga and Apttus merger in the CLM space? I'd be curious if you feel that, that has \u2013 that that could have any impact to the competitive landscape or your efforts in selling SpringCM.\nDan Springer: Yeah, I mean, we don't have a strong point of view that it's significant in any big way for us. We look at all the players in the space and we think we're really proud of what we've built and believe we've built the software, particularly in CLM, that will win and we're particularly pleased. If you had a chance to see the recent Gartner report, that had us at the top of their assessment, we are obviously very pleased being in that upper quadrant, but we think that there's going to be a lot of activity like this and we think that the ever-changing landscape is definitely something we look at closely, but there's nothing about that particular combination that we saw as having any significant impact on our business or our go-to-market and we didn't \u2013 when Conga was for sale, we didn't look at that as an asset that we thought really brought something special to DocuSign. And I guess people at Apttus see something there and hopefully they'll be able to get what they were hoping to get out of it.\nTaylor McGinnis: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sean Kennedy from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Kennedy: Hi. Good afternoon and great job on the quarter, guys. I was wondering what areas of your business were most challenged in a post-pandemic environment, although it doesn't seem like many, that could potentially recover over the next few quarters? And I'm thinking of some challenged sectors like travel, hospitality and also home buying.\nDan Springer: Yeah. And I think it's interesting. If you think about from a vertical standpoint, I actually think your real estate example is a great one. So, we've seen \u2013 we've actually done a lot to accommodate. It's an industry that we've been close to. It was a big part of the initial success of this company. And so we've created programs with the National Association of Realtors to give sort of 90-day free trials to realtors who are smaller users. They might not be able to afford DocuSign, if they don't have enough transaction volumes. Now we think over time, as those folks get to love DocuSign products and their business recovers, there'll be opportunity to upgrade them to paid products and so there could be a good sort of bounce to our business from that. And things like travel and hospitality are some of the other industries that are hit harder. One of the big challenge is, when are they going to see that bounce back in their business. I think when that happens, we will probably see some more increased growth opportunity for us in those verticals. But I don't think it's so much of like a pent-up demand. I think it's just more, in that case, a model of \u2013 they're not doing business transactions.  So, if you're a travel agent, as an example, and you use DocuSign for some of your packages, you're not sending travel packages right now. So, when you come to us, you don't need to renew it as higher volume. When that recovers, we do believe they'll go back to their old volumes and then, hopefully over time, continue to grow with us as their business grows. That's how I think about some of those opportunities.\nSean Kennedy: Great. And then just a quick one on CLM, I was wondering what the customer mix is like compared to eSignature. And it doesn't skew much higher toward larger company since it deals with more complex work processes and how does that affect the cross-sell opportunity?\nDan Springer: Yeah. I think it's a great question. I think what you'll find is that, to some extent, even small companies have a \u2013 effectively a CLM-like need to manage all of their contracts, but if you are a very small company and you have a small number of contracts in terms of the number of contracts you have or the different contracts that you have, and then a small volume of those contracts, you tend to say, I don't need a complex CLM system. So, we see that skewing more to our upper mid-market in the commercial segment and then into the enterprise. And I think, we think that's the case that we'll have for years to come. At the very small customers, they want \u2013 they might want like our Gen product, which is a sub-segment, what you find in CLM and Gen and the Negotiate functionality, which we released at Dreamforce last year \u2013 at the end of last year, that's what we see being sold more into the smaller customers, as opposed to the fuller CLM product.\nSean Kennedy: Great, thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year.\nDan Springer: Thanks.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks.\nDan Springer: Thank you guys all for joining us. We'd like to say, we look forward to seeing you out on the road. I guess we'd like seeing you virtually out on the road, over the next quarter. We got a lot of opportunity set up to see you all and we'll see you again next quarter. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Mike Sheridan",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dan mentioned, the worldwide shift to remote work has accelerated digital transformations across organizations and has resulted in unprecedented levels of demand for DocuSign products. We believe this accelerated growth in new customers and expansion within our installed base was driven by a sudden prioritization of our products, but we also believe that these customers will remain with us because they are realizing the value that our solutions deliver in any working environment.  Strong sales led by our eSignature solutions drove a 59% year-over-year increase in first quarter billings to $342 million. This growth also drove a 39% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $297 million in the first quarter. Subscription revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $281 million. We saw similar strength outside the U.S., as total international revenue grew over 46% year-over-year to $55 million. This quarter, we added almost 68,000 new customers. Of those, approximately 10,000 were direct customers, an increase of 43% year-over-year. This brings our total customer base to nearly 661,000 worldwide, with roughly 89,000 direct customers. These totals include a catch up adjustment of 4,000 direct customers related to review in reconciliation of prior year customer acquisitions. Strong eSignature expansions and upsells into our existing customer base led to dollar net retention of 119% in the quarter. Customers with ACVs greater than $300,000 grew 46% year-over-year, to a total of 473 customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 79%, consistent with a year ago. Subscription gross margin was 84%, compared with 86% a year ago. Margins were impacted by investments we made in our data center capacity, particularly for hosted services to ensure our ability to meet significantly higher transaction volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses total $210 million, or 71% of total revenue in the quarter, compared with $160 million, or 75% of total revenue in Q1 of last year. To address current demand and prepare for future growth, we pulled forward some of our sales capacity hires and expanded our marketing efforts, leading to higher sales and marketing expenses in the quarter.  Additionally, to help ease the transition to remote work after closing our offices in early March, we've provided employee stipends for virtual workspaces and other COVID related expenses. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the recent pandemic. We generated $23 million in non-GAAP operating profit or an 8% operating margin in the quarter. This compares with $10 million or 5% operating margin in the first quarter of last year. Non-GAAP net income was $24 million in the first quarter, compared with $13 million in the first quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 4,281 employees, an increase of 33% over the first quarter of last year. Operating cash flow in the first quarter increased almost 30% year-over-year to $59 million, compared with $46 million in the same quarter a year ago. CapEx increased during the quarter due to leasehold improvements and expansions to our existing offices, as well as the scaling of our federal data center. Free cash flow came in at $33 million, compared with $30 million a year ago. Now, let me turn to guidance. We anticipate that total revenue will range between $316 million and $320 million in Q2, and $1.313 billion to $1.317 billion for fiscal 2021. Of this total, we expect subscription revenue of $298 million to $302 million in Q2, and $1.243 billion to $1.247 billion for fiscal 2021. For billings, we expect $333 million to $343 million in Q2, and $1.515 billion to $1.535 billion for fiscal 2021. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 78% to 80% for both Q2 and fiscal 2021. For operating expenses, we expect sales and marketing expense in the range of 48% to 50% of revenues for Q2, and 47% to 49% for fiscal 2021. We expect R&D expense in the range of 14% to 16% for Q2, and 13% to 15% for fiscal 2021. And we expect G&A expense in the range of 9% to 11% for both Q2 and fiscal 2021. For the second quarter, we expect $2 million to $3 million of non-GAAP interest and other non-operating income. And for fiscal 2021, we expect $8 million to $12 million of non-GAAP interest and non-operating income. We expect a tax provision of approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million for Q2 and $6 million to $10 million for fiscal 2021. Finally, we expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding up 200 million to 205 million shares for Q2 and fiscal 2021. As a reminder, we closed the Seal acquisition on May 1. So, all of the guidance I just provided includes the anticipated impact of Seal. Since we anticipate that Seal will add less than 1% to our top line performance, we don't expect it to impact our near-term growth rates. Costs and operating expenses related to the Seal business are also a small part of our total expenses. However, we expect in the near term that they will have a small dilutive effect on our growth and operating margins. Thanks for joining us today. And now we will open up for Q&A. Yes, Sterling. I think when we're talking about capacity, it's a couple of things. First of all, in terms of our capacity to manage volumes, we have plenty of headroom. We've always remained well ahead of the curve and ensuring that our capacity is ahead of the volumes that we're seeing. And even when we had spikes with COVID, we have data that demonstrates that we were very safely above any capacity constraints. You know, when we look at capacity, to \u2013 that could impact things like our gross margins, expanding our customer support organization is an example, our customer success organization is an example to deal with issues that come up there. You know, some of our hosted bandwidth for Canada and for Australia, where we don't have our own proprietary data centers, transaction volumes can have an impact there. But overall, I think we entered Q2 very comfortable that we put ourselves in a position to deal with whatever transaction other [ph] volumes are going to materialize. Yeah, there definitely will be some examples that are used cases that are more project-oriented or one-time in nature. We see that as the extreme minority. What we really saw was that companies largely had either begun with us and had not gotten to scale or were thinking of moving on to DocuSign, but it wasn't as high on the hierarchy list of these other priorities. And the recent events pushed us up that priority list and also accelerated some of the scale that our existing customers were experiencing. So there was the effect of recent events and the coronavirus that maybe brought some of that demand to us. As I mentioned in my script, we believe strongly that it will stay with us because the value proposition that we're selling is the same and what they're realizing from that value proposition is going to apply to work-from-home environment, but it's also going to extend to whatever our remote working or in-office working looks like in the future. Yeah. So, Rob, I think when we track it internally, then we can align and go through that which I think our DBO's have actually been pretty stable. That said, we remain disciplined around not extending payment terms as we get larger and maintain good healthy deal dynamics around that. Did we get some inbound requests for slower payment? We did, and it was more or less anecdotal, but when it came in, we were responsive to it, especially if you have smaller businesses that were a bit cash-strapped, we tried to be responsive to that. What we wouldn't do is, we weren't changing the underlying contract terms, but we are allowing our collections organization to give more latitude and back off when companies needed a little more room. So, there was some of that in the quarter. It didn't really change major trends in our cash flows, but I think if we see some of that materialize in the coming quarters, we'll respond in a similar way. Yeah, let me start on the churn perspective. We don't think that our situation is analogous to Zoom's volumes and so forth. As I mentioned previously, we believe that, of course, our business, like any, has churn. We think it's going to remain pretty stable because we think that the value propositions, again, we're delivering are sustainable, whether it's a work-from-home environment or not. In terms of contribution from our e-commerce platform, our self-service business in Q2 was about 12% or 13%, which is pretty consistent with what it has been in and out. Remember that the significant majority of our customers come to us through e-commerce, albeit that they represent a relatively small percentage of our revenue. But there's two really important dynamics of that. There's some critical verticals that are serviced in there. Verticals like real estate. It's a source for many of our customers when they first engaged with us to then graduate to move up to a direct relationship with us. And it's also a major driver of brand and awareness for our products. So, while it's a relatively smaller percentage of our top-line, it's a critical element of the overall model. Yeah. So, a couple of things. One of the exciting parts of Q1 was we had a lot of things contributing to that growth. We had, as you heard, large growth in direct new customers. We had 10,000 in the quarter. We also had really strong expansion inside the installed base. Our dollar net retention hit the high end of our range to 119%. So, we really saw strength across all those primary growth areas. I think if you look at the cadence between quarters, I've always talked about, look at the billings statistic as a rolling four quarter average as opposed to a particular data point. I think if you look at last year's Q1, as you recall, it was a little bit lower. If you look at last year's Q2 it was pretty strong. So, you'll see some of that dynamic impact the percentage. Overall, again, if you look at it on an average basis over the course of the year, I think the growth is pretty correlated to the underlying growers in the business. So, those are what's really contributing to it. Obviously, in Q1, the suddenness of people having to change their work habits is a single data point that we wouldn't want to draw a trend line through that single data point too aggressively, but we are entering Q2, continuing to see a good start. So, we're incorporating all of that into the guidance that I gave you. Yeah, the one other piece to that question that you brought up that I think is important is if you imagine back in March when we very suddenly had to close our offices and send 4,000 people home, at that very same time, we had a dramatic increase in our demand and we had a process that if we talked about transactions earlier on our infrastructure, you mentioned the sales teams, there's the Rev ops team that has to process that increased quantity from location that they're not used to working. All of those things together, it really tested our environment and one of the things that came out of Q1, very happy about is, it was a very resilient environment even with some of the pressures put upon us to have to change how we were doing our business. Yeah. Hi, Walter. Yeah, so a couple of things. I think one of the great strengths that we've talked a lot about with DocuSign is we sell to the very smallest businesses in our self-service e-commerce world, we sell to the Fortune 10 and we have strength selling into the mids and the majors and the small businesses direct through commercial. So, if we looked at the broad growth that we had over the course of the quarter, we talked a little bit before that there will be some anecdotal things around PPP or other project based use cases, but if you look beyond that at the overall growth, Dan sort of touched upon how it's spread across verticals.  It's spread across those segments as well. It really did, and it was a nice combination of new direct, as well as expansion of scale within the installed base. So, it was broad. Within there, there is going to be some pockets, travel and entertainment might be one pocket, it wasn't as strong, you might look at healthcare, life sciences that showed a bit more strength than the common quarter. But when I went back and looked at the complexion of the growth, it was nice and broad-based. Yeah, hi, Daniel. So, a couple of things. As I mentioned in my script, International grew 46% year-over-year. So, we continue to see a really strong contribution from that part of our business. I think as we've talked in the past, some of those markets, large markets like a Germany, a France and so forth that are civil law countries are in a bit of an earlier stage than what we've seen domestically, but each quarter, we're continuing to see improvements in those major markets. And I also mentioned before that some of the infrastructure we have around how we structure data centers and so forth, we've built into those markets as they expand, so markets like Australia and like Canada, that may be a bit earlier. We're going to leverage infrastructure like Azure to address those, but overall, we look at those markets, it's a significant part of our TAM. We are seeing evidence that the needs of customers in those regions are the same as the needs that we're servicing in the U.S. and that continues to drive a huge opportunity for us that we're investing aggressively in. Yeah. So, probably the biggest contributor to that is the addition of CLM to the business and some of the costs associated with that business that aren't as leveraged as our scaled eSignature business. If you look at our long-term target model, it stayed the same at 78% to 82%. And I think that what will allow us to remain in that range and the increase in that range, overall, both in terms of subscriptions and professional services, is really just going to be continued to scale. So, if you look at Seal, is another example. Seal, as I mentioned in my comments, is going to have a near term small dilutive effect on gross margins as well just because their top-line contribution won't match the infrastructure we're bringing over as part of that acquisition, but those are near term and they're fairly minor and I remain guiding that 78% to 82% for gross margins for our long-term model. Yes. So, at this point, I'm really not changing the range. I don't foresee us being anywhere near the lower side of that range. I think if we remain in that range, we continue to drive a healthy outcome in the business. If we see something more sustainable over time, we'll always reconsider it and look at that, but for now we're keeping the range the same. So, Taylor, couple of things, first, one thing that we don't do much of, very little of, is we're not a model that has a lot of billings for overages. We look at opportunities where customers who have exceeded their capacity or their subscription is the time to go back and upsell them in an early renewal.

Then that drives that dollar net retention, that up-sell opportunity and that expansion opportunity in the future, but in the near term, if you're looking at how much of Q1 billings was affected by our going back to customers and billing them for overages, it's very, very small."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks Anne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. For today's call, I will share updates and context around three primary topics. First, the company's business performance and financial results for the quarter; second, the ways that COVID-19 has led customers to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives for agreements; and third, our views on the future based on the best data we have today.  Before I get to that though, I want to acknowledge just how much life has changed since our last call. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally shifted the global macroeconomic environment and impacted countless lives around the world. We've seen all manner of private, public, and nonprofit organizations step up to help, and I'd like to take this opportunity to personally think all the first responders, healthcare workers, medical researchers, and local leaders who have made such a difference to the lives of so many. At DocuSign, we've done what we can to step up too, both in our initial response to the pandemic and as we all continue to adapt to this evolving impact. For safety reasons, in early March, we transitioned our more than 4,000 employees across 15 countries to remote work environment. We offered $1,300 in assistance to employees for tools and services to help ease that transition. Then we offered additional programs and assistance to streamline the process even further. We also mobilize resources to handle a surge in urgent needs from our customers. In some cases, this meant directly supporting COVID-19 responses by government agencies, healthcare organizations, and those on the front line. In others, it meant helping organizations to keep their business processes running while their workforce has transitioned to remote work. I'll give you specific examples later, but suffice it to say that over this time, we had a lot coming at us to make this transition while maintaining the highest levels of platform availability, customer service, and remote onboarding all while facing unprecedented levels of customer demand is nothing short of exceptional. I'd like to salute the truly extraordinary efforts of the DocuSign team for their agility and commitment to our customer's success. Now this collective effort is reflected in our Q1 results. Our Billings grew 59% year-over-year to $342 million, and revenue grew 39% to $297 million. This strong growth was driven by used case expansion across a broad cross section of our installed base, as well as adoption by new customers. We added more than 10,000 net new direct customers and almost 58,000 self service customers, bringing our global total of paying customers to nearly 661,000. And our operating margins and cash flow remained strong, even as we made key investments to address this heightened demand. Much of the strong Q1 performance was driven by increased demand for a signature from organizations that suddenly needed a way to sign and manage agreements from wherever they were. Typically, eSignature is the first step that many customers take on their broader digital transformation journey with us. So, from a financial point-of-view, we believe this surge in eSignature adoption bodes well for future Agreement Cloud expansion. Now, let me share some examples of how we've helped our customers respond to COVID-19 and keep their agreement prophecies up and running amid the pandemic. We worked closely with a global pharmaceutical company to accelerate its eSignature expansion to hundreds of use cases across 80 different countries. This is a pattern that we saw many times over the quarter. A customer already had a plan to expand and COVID-19 greatly accelerated it. We engaged a new public sector customer, the Department of Labor in one of the largest U.S. states to help transform its previously complex and lengthy process for handling emergency unemployment benefits. Supported by DocuSign eSignature, the department distributed over $500 million in benefits to more than 500,000 residents in less than one week. We enabled hundreds of U.S. national and regional financial institutions to accept applications for small business administration loans more efficiently. At one of those large banks, we were involved with over 0.5 million loan applications, 75% of which were signed in less than 24 hours. We worked with a regional telecom provider using DocuSign Intelligent Insights, which is our contract analytics tool to analyze potential pandemic-related risks in thousands of their supplier contracts. Finally, we helped the European telemedicine provider issue e-prescriptions and online sick leave certificates by using our video identification capability to confirm the patients' identities. These are just a few examples. You can find many more on our dedicated COVID-19 web page. Let me speak briefly about where we see things going from here. Well, no one is 100% sure what the world will look like. It's clear that the ways of doing business are changing. Remote work is here to stay, core business processes will only become more digital, and agreements will need to be completed from anywhere at any time on almost any device. As a result, for organizations that hadn't already embraced DocuSign for eSignature where they were only using us for a few select use cases, the pandemic has been a catalyst for the greater digital transformation of their end-to-end agreement processes. We always believed this transformation will happen and that a unifying platform for agreements will be needed. COVID-19 is just happening faster. That said, even when the COVID-19 situation is behind us, we don't anticipate customers returning to paper or manual based processes. Once they take their first digital transformation steps with us, and they realize the time, cost, and customer experience benefits, they rarely go back.  So, in short, we expect the adoption of our core eSignature offering by new customers, and the expansion of use cases by existing ones to continue. This also acts as the on ramp for the adoption of other agreement cloud products, sometimes at the same time, and sometimes as follow-ons. Of course, as Mike will tell you, we are not immune to the broader economic forces at play. Some businesses and industries will continue to contract, some will continue to expand, some of our customers may request payment deferral and accommodations, and some will require even more hands-on support and assistance. Even with these dynamics, our view of the business remains optimistic. We're off to a good start in the second quarter as digital transformation remains a high priority. We feel truly fortunate to have built solutions that can help customers carry on through this time of crisis, and to deliver even greater value as we transition to a world where work becomes more digital and more remote. In the meantime, we will continue to do whatever we can, wherever we can to help our customers succeed. With that, I'd like to hand over to Mike to walk us through the financials in more detail and I'll talk to you again when we get to the Q&A. Mike? I think it's fairly broad. You know, we don't have any one industry that is, you know, a significant portion. We have a lot of strong industries and some of those like financial services did particularly well, like the specific example I gave around the SBA loans, Sterling. We also saw a lot of strength in Healthcare and Life Sciences. We also saw the government sector being very strong as a lot of folks had that phenomenon we described. They knew at some point they were going to have to do more digital transformation to their business and COVID-19 has accelerated it. So, we see that being very broad. Obviously, there's some industries to think about, particularly hospitality and travel that we see that have, you know, been weakened industries, and some of those, so to continue running their business need to run on DocuSign. So, we haven't seen, you know, some sort of collapse or anything, but we would see less growth in those segments that are hit harder, and that's kind of how we're seeing it across the board. Well, I'll give you a couple thoughts. You know, on that, I think the first piece is, we get most excited when people build workflows that integrate with our software and leverage API's, and almost two-thirds of the transactions that occur on our platform are not from someone going into our web or mobile interface and creating a document to be signed or for that matter, in a CLM framework, a document to be routed around and managed. It's from people who are actually building integrations to their systems and that can be the pre-built integrations we have with SAP and Salesforce.com and Workday, other great SaaS businesses, and it could be -- APIs they've integrated themselves using our developer tools. So, those are the ones that we get most excited about, because they as you indicated are the stickiest. And the second dimension that I would think about it is, we get really excited about the situations where, as I said, people sort of, run their business on DocuSign. So, if those are back office use cases where they might be managing their financial processes and their PO processes, and all of those get integrated to those back office tools into DocuSign, that's great. But also on the front office situations, particularly, and you mentioned real estate, when you see something like a mortgage product or our digital rooms product, and there's multiple players involved. So, whether or not they're all using API calls, but there's multiple individuals that need to have an agreement routed around to them, and those front office use cases can then sometimes be quite complex, leverage the functionality and the capability we've built, very sticky because the ROI is so high for companies and so important that they have a great customer experience, which is why we get such a high net promoter score because our customers' customers like using DocuSign with our customers. So those would be the two dimensions I would point to that I think we're most focused on when we talk about building those deeper integrated use cases. Yeah, absolutely. And I think government overall is an important vertical for us, although, as I mentioned before, it's no one vertical, is a dramatic portion of our revenue and we don't see government overall in the top couple, but it is an important and growing segment nonetheless. I mentioned some of the examples I gave around government, if you think about the state and local segments in the state example I gave around the health and human services side and people doing processing of emergency needs to get unemployment benefits of folks, we saw that as a very strong quarter for us and we've had a lot of momentum there. Federal have been newer for us and because part of that was getting the FedRAMP certification that was required to serve a lot of folks, and now we're building the dedicated data center as you referred to, which will unlock another set of opportunities for us with different federal agencies. But we also \u2013 have also mentioned before and we see this as well that even in a COVID-19 situation, we may see that some aspects of the federal government still moves a little bit more slowly than some of the other private sector in terms of adoption of digital technologies. So, we will be a patient provider to them as a customer. And I think from a long term perspective, we continue to see this as a dramatic growth opportunity. I ask the banks that question every day, Pat. That's, as you imagine, something we pose to them as well. I think the reality is, there's two things that I would point to that stop adoption where the consumer proposition is so high. As an example, you just said with the need for a remote model for notary and I think they really come in two buckets. The first one is this perceived regulation and we see a lot of times, companies will say, yeah, that's not legal here, it's not allowed, and of course, it probably is, but it's just practice and people have done something for a long time. We see this with some of the attorneys in the legal profession who use \u2013 do a lot of contracts and agreements and they'll say, oh yeah, we love DocuSign, but we can't do it for these types of contracts. Often times they're incorrect. They just don't \u2013 they don't understand that. And then the second thing that I think occurs is, we have the \u2013 on the consumer side is changing that behavior and that's sort of the organization needs to change, whether it's the company or the end consumer and change in management is not trivial. We see that a lot in back-office situations where, as an example, if you're using and your HR department is on-boarding employees, and they're used to doing that by sending offer letters in the mail, filling out I-9's in person when people would show up, and one of the things that's great about COVID-19 is we realized people like to on-board employees without doing that. And so the offer letters now are going out with DocuSign and the I-9 can be done remotely. And so, I think it's just one by one. We kind of have to hit each of those barriers that are usually perceived not real from a legality standpoint. And on the notary side, I'll just give you a last comment. I mean, that's an area we see as a big growth area for us and we believe we're going to be, in the coming quarters, talking a lot more about how we want to expand on the capability to meet our customers' needs across a variety of solutions to make notary easier for people, but that's \u2013 I think those are the reality of things that we face as the hurdles to driving that adoption. Yeah, it is. I actually think we think about work-from-home and the travel restriction in a very similar way. I think we believe that there is quite a lot of change that's going to occur. We see it, by the way, in our own companies. We start thinking about coming back into the office and how we want to safely bring our employees back. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, all 4,000-plus of our employees are working from home now. And we think that things have changed sort of forever and we talk about this among our executive staff when we meet now that we're rethinking how we think about travel and we're rethinking about which jobs we believe need to be in an office or always in an office. So, I think we're going to see that the need for people to do their agreements, as you said, not just the signatures, but the overall agreement processes from remote settings is going to be real and increased. But as we like to think about it is, that might be the impetus for people to, for the first time, say, \u2018This is the way I need to manage my business today; I don't have the ability to do manual paper-based processes in offices,' but then when they see the cost savings, the time savings and the better experience, I think they're going to look at it and say, \u2018I want all of my business process to run this way.' And even if some of the work-from-home and some of the travel mitigates, those restrictions mitigate, which I do believe they will, I don't think it'll be completely back to the old normal, but I think it'll be somewhat. The need to have those digital services are going to be just as strong and they will maintain that usage. So, that's kind of how we see that developing. Well, so I think one of the things that we saw was the dramatic portion of the acceleration that we wouldn't have seen pre-COVID- 19 was signature-centric and that's for a couple of reasons. One, the ROI on eSignature is so incredibly high. So people have always found that when they have that opportunity to find solutions that can meet, it's a great answer for folks. And so I think we saw a lot of people say, this is a great opportunity for you to be smart about where I run my business. The second thing is when you think about your overall Agreement Cloud work, eSignature tends to be the entry point. One of the reasons we built such as signature business of scale, before we broadened to the other Agreement Cloud, it's just a starting point for most people. And in fact, if we think about the broader CLM capability, if you don't have digital agreements with digital signatures on them, it's hard to think about a digital solution for managing your contracts and agreement. So, you really go the other way first. So, we think that absolutely will happen. And then the second phenomenon is that because we saw that the need for remote work and for people to be able to get these transactions, both internal ones, as well as external ones with customers, managed when people are working from home, there was, again, an urgency to get a lot of those eSignature projects up and running and CLM, interestingly enough, tends to be a longer sales cycle. It's \u2013 usually a statement of work is involved, some sort of systems integration or professional services involved. And I think we're seeing across the software world, the slightly more complex projects that are a little larger in initial scope, less land and expand, and more one bigger entry point, are the ones that are going to face a little pushback and delays. And so from a standpoint of the time to close those deals, those times would extend a little bit. So, that's why we saw eSignature being particularly strong in the quarter. When we look out over the next several quarters, we see that phenomenon will dissipate over time. Some of the deals that might elongate from a Q1 into a Q2 and then some into a Q3, you'll continue to see some of those pushing forward into those later quarters, which will give us tailwinds there, but most importantly is, all these new eSignature wins, if you think about those 10,000 direct customers that came in, significant portion of those came in with eSignature and in the quarters ahead, they're going to be our most fertile opportunity to cross-sell and expand their overall Agreement Cloud solution. Yeah. Stan, I think we're pretty bullish as we talked about earlier in the call. I think we're very bullish about the government vertical. And to your specific question around timing of the year, remember, because our core business and eSignature is still the significant biggest part of what we bring to the government, is more of a land and expand model. We don't have the same phenomenon that you might see in some other software companies where it's all about getting that end of the year contract done, whether it's a big sales cycle that maybe goes for a couple of years and then trying to get a big splash at the end of the year. We tend to see it happening more evenly across the year. So sometimes there's a budget cycle opportunity for us around something like a CLM deal and we saw that, remember last year where we had the VA discussion where we had sort of a very large deal, but most of our government work, and specifically from the federal here, really does occur in the land and expand model with lots of small expansions that we build over time. Thank you. Yeah. So it's really interesting, and Kirk, at the time of our IPO, one of the things we talked about when we had less broad of an Agreement Cloud set of offerings, but we had the phenomena of the land and expand and we shared some customer stories, where we had some customers that started off very small with us and over a series of six years had grown into very large businesses, but there wasn't, sort of, necessarily an inflection point. There was a lot of small additional adds. Now in the signature-only world, that's what I would expect. As you think about the broader Agreement Cloud, to your question, we are likely going to have scenarios where we do get a signature land. We continue to add additional used cases and expansion of eSignature, but also make a very large Agreement Cloud splash with the customer. And I think that can happen in that sort of three, four quarters time period, where it have a chance to implement signature, get that early success and win and the organization gets excited about DocuSign and we come back to really start working on the Agreement Cloud. Keep in mind that some of those other components do have a longer sales cycle and implementation. So, even if within one or two quarters of a land with eSignature, if someone expressed a lot of interest to a broader, let's say, a CLM solution, it would probably be several quarters from then before we got the sale done, got the statement of work in place and you see that showing up as DocuSign revenue. So, I don't think you should think about it as quick kick. We should think about that as a nice elongated revenue growth path for us to go into. That's sort of how I would generally think about the opportunity for us to do that expansion. And the only other thing I would just add, though, is that when I look at our opportunity around the Agreement Cloud, the clear obvious thing to point to, as Mike talked about, is over \u2013 well over 600,000 customers. The majority of those are signature-only. That's really the cross-sell opportunity. So, it's not like we're thinking about the CLM sale opportunity and saying, well, we can't go talk to someone for CLM other than the people that joined last quarter eSignature. We've got years of signature customers that are sort of a pent-up opportunity for us to bring the Agreement Cloud and that's where we're really focus today. Yeah. Let me give you a couple of thoughts and Mike might have some additional perspective as well. But the answer, as is the case with a lot of things at DocuSign, is all of the above. We're such an unusual company that we serve from the smallest customers up to the absolute largest customers across all verticals, across the variety of geographies, selling in over 150 countries. So, we are very broad and that's exactly what happened here. We had a good solid pipeline of business that had nothing to do with COVID-19 that would have set us up for a solid quarter in Q1 and a lot of those deals and process that we would expect to have happened and our sales team executed across those. We also had, to the nature of your question, some additional much faster timeline deals where people came to us and said, \"I really need to get going with DocuSign, I've always known that, but I just haven't gotten around to doing it.\" So some of those were people who had conversations going on with us and those accelerated, and some in that whole cycle was done within the quarter where someone called us and said, \"You need to help me get up to speed quickly\". Some of the healthcare opportunities were big. If you think about the situation where you're trying to \u2013 you're now trying to do COVID-19 testing and you've never been an organization that did that kind of testing before, and now you say, \"I got to figure out a way to get people's information and get them to fill out forms, Oh! But I don't want to touch them, I don't want to touch anything they've touched, I also need a digital solution for doing that.\" And we had sales cycles that happened in that in a matter of days, where people came to us, explained that business need that they had, or that healthcare need that they had and we were able to get up and running that used case. So there really was quite a range across each of those pieces. And then to your deal size, very specific question, when Mike and I do a review, which we just did two days ago, we look at our pricing and we look at what's different in terms of quarter-to-quarter, in terms of how people are buying from us and what the nature of those deals look like, there wasn't anything in this quarter that would suggest larger deal sizes on average even within the segments that Mike was just walking you through. So, I don't think there was anything notable. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that when we talk about our land to expand opportunity, it's so significant but it's hard for me to imagine, Walter, that there could be some dramatic change in that initial land that would change the kind of upsell our long term expansion opportunity because it's such a big multiple of our typical initial land. So, I wouldn't expect anything different than our typical great growth opportunity from that going forward. I don't think we see anything that we would call a significant change from that standpoint. I think the phenomenon in Q1 that we alluded to earlier, was that there were some increase in sales cycles for some deals because of the urgency of those used cases. I think that will probably revert to the mean over time. And then to your point about does the DocuSign sell get easier as we become more prominent around the brand, I suppose there could be something there incrementally. I don't have anything I could point to yet to tell you we have observed something. And I can clearly tell you we're not changing at this point our expectations or our plans for our cycles. Again, by segment, as Mike said, different for each segment, but we don't have anything at this point that we would point to and say within a segment we think the sales cycles would be different going forward. Yeah, I don't think we've seen anything particularly from COVID that would accelerate that move where we work with one or two divisions and now we get more of an enterprise solution other than the same macro piece we talked about, which is, as companies are increasingly seeing the need to drive the digital transformation, that's accelerating. It probably, at the same rate, would accelerate those expansions from divisional projects to broader enterprise-wide solutions, but I think, at this point, we'd say, that phenomenon is occurring. It's always been a big growth opportunity for us and I think it's the same big growth opportunity for us going forward, but I don't think COVID acceleration of digital transformation is going to change that phenomenon or that rate at which we see that going, other than just making everything go a little bit faster. Yeah, I mean, we don't have a strong point of view that it's significant in any big way for us. We look at all the players in the space and we think we're really proud of what we've built and believe we've built the software, particularly in CLM, that will win and we're particularly pleased. If you had a chance to see the recent Gartner report, that had us at the top of their assessment, we are obviously very pleased being in that upper quadrant, but we think that there's going to be a lot of activity like this and we think that the ever-changing landscape is definitely something we look at closely, but there's nothing about that particular combination that we saw as having any significant impact on our business or our go-to-market and we didn't \u2013 when Conga was for sale, we didn't look at that as an asset that we thought really brought something special to DocuSign. And I guess people at Apttus see something there and hopefully they'll be able to get what they were hoping to get out of it. Yeah. And I think it's interesting. If you think about from a vertical standpoint, I actually think your real estate example is a great one. So, we've seen \u2013 we've actually done a lot to accommodate. It's an industry that we've been close to. It was a big part of the initial success of this company. And so we've created programs with the National Association of Realtors to give sort of 90-day free trials to realtors who are smaller users. They might not be able to afford DocuSign, if they don't have enough transaction volumes. Now we think over time, as those folks get to love DocuSign products and their business recovers, there'll be opportunity to upgrade them to paid products and so there could be a good sort of bounce to our business from that. And things like travel and hospitality are some of the other industries that are hit harder. One of the big challenge is, when are they going to see that bounce back in their business. I think when that happens, we will probably see some more increased growth opportunity for us in those verticals. But I don't think it's so much of like a pent-up demand. I think it's just more, in that case, a model of \u2013 they're not doing business transactions.  So, if you're a travel agent, as an example, and you use DocuSign for some of your packages, you're not sending travel packages right now. So, when you come to us, you don't need to renew it as higher volume. When that recovers, we do believe they'll go back to their old volumes and then, hopefully over time, continue to grow with us as their business grows. That's how I think about some of those opportunities. Yeah. I think it's a great question. I think what you'll find is that, to some extent, even small companies have a \u2013 effectively a CLM-like need to manage all of their contracts, but if you are a very small company and you have a small number of contracts in terms of the number of contracts you have or the different contracts that you have, and then a small volume of those contracts, you tend to say, I don't need a complex CLM system. So, we see that skewing more to our upper mid-market in the commercial segment and then into the enterprise. And I think, we think that's the case that we'll have for years to come. At the very small customers, they want \u2013 they might want like our Gen product, which is a sub-segment, what you find in CLM and Gen and the Negotiate functionality, which we released at Dreamforce last year \u2013 at the end of last year, that's what we see being sold more into the smaller customers, as opposed to the fuller CLM product. Thanks. Thank you guys all for joining us. We'd like to say, we look forward to seeing you out on the road. I guess we'd like seeing you virtually out on the road, over the next quarter. We got a lot of opportunity set up to see you all and we'll see you again next quarter. Thank you so much."

I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Springer. Dan?\nDaniel Springer: Thank you, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you today as we'll cover our performance for the quarter and for the entire fiscal year. We'll talk in more detail about some important sales wins and recent innovations that continue to bring our vision for the Agreement Cloud to life. Finally, we'll look ahead to our focus areas for fiscal '23. I'd like to start by sharing a few observations about the quarter. Q4 total revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $581 million with an 18% non-GAAP operating margin. Billings grew 25% year-over-year in the quarter. International revenue grew 55% year-over-year. We added nearly 60,000 new customers in the quarter, and that's a 31% increase year-over-year. And we continue to see strong net dollar retention of 119% in Q4, which is at the high end of our historical range. Looking at the year, we grew revenue 45% to over $2 billion and billings by 37% to over $2.35 billion. We added more than 280,000 new customers, ending the year with over 1.17 million customers in total. These results reflect our team's unwavering dedication amid the macro challenges and the needed shifts in our business coming out of COVID. They also showcased continued tailwinds for the digitization of agreement workflows for businesses of every shape and size. We recognize, of course, that fiscal year '22 had 2 distinct chapters that contribute to our growth story. During the peak of the pandemic, urgent need drove dramatic acceleration of purchases, and our sales focus was squarely set on meeting that elevated demand. This motion carried through the first half of fiscal year '22. In the second half of the year, there were more challenging macro conditions impacting our customers' priorities. We saw a diminished level of urgency in their buying patterns. Customers turned their focus to investments and projects that were delayed during the heart of the pandemic. As we saw urgent demand wane, we have just begun to shift in our sales motion, back to a demand generation mode of cross-sell, upsell and departmental expansion. While we excel at demand generation for many years pre-COVID, ultimately, the shift in customer buying patterns coming out of the pandemic was quicker than we anticipated, and we didn't move fast enough as an organization. Our move from capturing high volumes of customer demand to reverting back to generating demand is now well underway. We expect this work will continue through fiscal year 2023 as we make tangible progress moving through the year. At over $2 billion in annual revenue, we believe we're still very early in the first 10% of the $50 billion Agreement Cloud market opportunity. Digital transformation remains a high priority for businesses at every scale in every industry. Given our strong brand, a leading market position and product differentiation, DocuSign is uniquely positioned to lead and capture that market opportunity with eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud. As the pandemic subside and people begin to return to the office, they are not returning to paper. eSignature is clearly here to stay, and the movement toward the broader Agreement Cloud will only continue to gain prominence. We are confident we have massive market space to grow. When we think about the opportunity this year presents, it falls into 2 main buckets: the ways we're helping our customers succeed on our platform; and the innovation we're bringing to market. Last quarter, we doubled down on our global go-to-market methodology and began driving our field org to focus on expanding opportunities. As our customers scale their usage across departments and new use cases, our field approach is also evolving. To that end, we've been bolstering our field leadership with strong leaders with GMs in EMEA, APJ and LATAM, along with recent additions across North America in the commercial and SMB segments. And we're very close to finalizing a new North American enterprise sales leader as well. Importantly, we've begun a search for an executive to lead the global field organization at success and sales. This supports our goal of scaling our business to $5 billion and beyond. As part of this change, once we have secured and onboarded our new leader, Loren will transition from DocuSign. Now it's hard to think of a sales executive as having more impact on a company than Loren has had here in his 14 years, from director to North American leader to CRO. He has really built the sales organization here. And as noted above, he's leading the way as we expand the sales leadership team for our next level of scale. He'll be staying with the company this year, and he remains focused on delivering for our customers and for driving our growth. Loren will be a big part of helping us to transition to the new sales and success leader in the coming months. We're already encouraged from the results we're seeing from these efforts, as we are upselling eSignature to more departments and use cases, cross-selling our key add-ons like identity verification, notary and monitor as well as cross-selling our CLM products. For example, last quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of the world's largest insurance and financial services companies, implementing new use cases for remote online notary for affidavit, citizenship verification and claims recovery; and DocuSign verify for loans and cash out statements. By deepening their adoption of the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, they shared that the efficiency gained by their employees and independent agents enabled them to realize tremendous savings in both time and operational expense, all while improving the self-service customer experience and maintaining strict regulatory compliance. We're hearing the same story across our key verticals with new customers as well. Last quarter, one of the largest pharmacy chains in the U.S. adopted eSignature and our AI-powered CLM products as part of their ongoing digital transformation initiative. The Agreement Cloud was the answer to replacing the manual processes across their agreement systems, which were described to us as painful and time-consuming. From that initial order, we're now seeing 75 different use cases across departments and an opportunity to deliver nearly 10 million envelopes annually. Around the world, DocuSign's value prop is just as strong. Last quarter, for example, we welcome Westpac New Zealand, part of Australia's Westpac Group, to the Agreement Cloud. Like so many customers who start with DocuSign eSignature, our exceptional employee and customer experience opens the door to more use cases. For Westpac New Zealand, this led to the adoption of CLM, Gen plus send and a significant API integration, all within the first year of our relationship. The second big opportunity this fiscal year is our continued innovation to drive stickiness and deepen our roots as a multiproduct company. More users are engaging with DocuSign every day as we work to make it even easier for them to adopt more of the advanced capabilities of the Agreement Cloud, eliminating paper, automating manual processes and connecting customers to the other systems they already use. A great example is the new DocuSign eSignature app for Zoom that enables organizations to reimagine their customer agreement process with virtual face-to-face signing experiences that our customers' customers really love. Through this new partnership, our customers can now securely share, review and complete agreements right from Zoom. In the next few weeks, we'll launch a new eSignature capability called Joint Agreements for businesses with a network model. Joint Agreements allows for a single customer experience with co-management of agreements between multiple parties behind the scenes. This makes things easier for every party involved. We believe Joint Agreements will inspire large financial services firms to encourage the use of DocuSign by their networks, which often number in the tens of thousands of advisers or agents. Next month, we're also planning to launch an important new feature called Delayed Routing for DocuSign eSignature. This allows users to add timing delays during the routing process of an envelope. This fine-tuning of the agreement process has become an increasingly popular customer ask, especially for situations where regulations require a delay like some franchising agreements that require a 1-week delay for a review before they can be signed. In total, fiscal '22 results were very strong, and I'm proud of how we as a team are moving to adapt and recalibrate to address the rapidly shifting market dynamics that we're facing post-COVID. Despite the temporal headwinds, we're continuing to focus on winning both new customers and existing customer expansions and on driving continued innovation. As a clear market leader, we've got long-term momentum on our side, a vision that's unchanged and a massive TAM. The changes we're making to our go-to-market strategy will, indeed, take a few quarters to play out. But we believe we're still just scratching the surface of our long-term opportunity and are better positioned than ever for future success. Before handing it over to Cynthia to walk you through our Q4 results and the fiscal year '23 outlook in more detail, I want to take a moment to thank the DocuSign team and our customers. Together, you're inspiring us to continue pioneering. Just this week, DocuSign was named one of Fast Company's top 10 Most Innovative Enterprise Companies. It's great to see others recognize our work, but more importantly, it's a true testament to our hardworking team and the positive impact our customers are helping us make on the world. With that, Cynthia, over to you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we had a solid finish to the year. While fiscal '22 unfolded differently than we initially anticipated with the first half stronger than expected and the back half slowing faster than anticipated, net-net, we achieved most of our financial and operating goals for the year. We scaled to become a multibillion-dollar business and achieved record cash flow and operating margins, successfully balancing growth and profitability. We continue to build out our Agreement Cloud portfolio with the addition of multiple new products and capabilities to further digitize agreement workflows, and we helped 280,000 new customers begin their digital journey. With that, let me turn to the Q4 and fiscal 2022 results. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 35% year-over-year to $581 million and subscription revenue grew 37% year-over-year to $564 million. For the full year, total revenue reached $2.1 billion, an increase of 45% over last year and subscription revenue hit $2 billion, an increase of 47%. Our international revenue continued to outpace our domestic growth at 55% year-over-year to $138 million in the fourth quarter, contributing 24% of total revenue. For the full year, international revenue grew over 68% to $481 million, representing 23% of our total revenue and reflecting our accelerated expansion across geographies. Fourth quarter billings rose 25% year-over-year to $670 million, leading to a 4-quarter rolling average of 37%. For the full year, billings increased 37% to $2.4 billion. With the addition of nearly 60,000 new customers in the fourth quarter, our total installed base grew 31% for the full year with over 1.17 million customers worldwide. We added 10,000 new direct customers in Q4 and 45,000 for the year, a 36% increase year-over-year, bringing our total to 170,000 direct customers. Customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grew 42% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 852 customers. We achieved 119% dollar net retention for the quarter, at the high end of our historic range. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 81% compared with 80% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was 82% compared to 79% a year ago. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 85%, consistent with last year. For the full year, subscription gross margin was 85% versus 84% a year ago. Q4 non-GAAP operating profit reached $104 million compared with $75 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 18% compared to 17% last year. For the full year, non-GAAP operating profit rose 132% to $419 million, and operating margin was 20% versus 12% in fiscal '21. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $100 million compared with $77 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, net income was $411 million, up from $182 million in fiscal '21, a growth rate of 125% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 7,461 employees, an increase of 33% over last year. We exited the year with $898 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter grew 41% year-over-year to $88 million or a 15% margin. This compares with $62 million or 14% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was $70 million or 12% margin compared to $44 million or 10% in the prior year, a 60% increase year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow grew 71% to $506 million or a 24% margin compared to $297 million or 20% a year ago. And free cash flow more than doubled, growing at 107% year-over-year to $445 million or 21% margin compared to $215 million or 15% margin in fiscal '21. Additionally, we continue to invest for the health of our planet through our sustainability initiatives. Our products have helped save over 55 billion sheets of paper and 6 million trees so far, and we achieved carbon-neutral status this year. We are continuing our efforts to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050 as part of the business ambition pledge by committing to setting science-based targets aligned with a 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory for a net-zero future. Let me now turn to our guidance. As Dan mentioned, early in fiscal '22, we continue to benefit from macro tailwinds with strong residual customer demand. Today, while we see the lingering effects tapering from the heightened demand we saw a year ago, we expect to see a slower start to fiscal 2023 while we progress our go-to-market initiatives over the next few quarters. As we gain traction and execute against our strategy, we continue to win new customers and support existing customer success and expansion. We expect to see the related growth contribution picking up as we move through the year. We have worked diligently to incorporate the above factors into our current outlook. With that, let's turn to guidance. Total revenue of $579 million to $583 million in Q1 or growth of 24% year-over-year and $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $562 million to $566 million in Q1 or a growth of 24% to 25% year-over-year and $2.39 billion to $2.41 billion for fiscal '23 or a growth of 18% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $573 million to $583 million in Q1 or growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year and $2.71 billion to $2.73 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q1 and fiscal '23. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 16% to 18% for both Q1 and fiscal '23. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, including undrawn revolver fees related to our credit facility. For fiscal '23, we expect a tax provision of approximately $4 million to $8 million. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for both Q1 and fiscal '23. Additionally, our Board authorized a $200 million open market share repurchase program. This program underscores our confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business and allows us to flexibly leverage our balance sheet to efficiently deliver returns to our shareholders. Our primary focus will continue to be investing for long-term growth, particularly in sales capacity and enablement, marketing, product innovation and the scaling of our operations, as we are still in the early stages of this large and growing market opportunity. Before turning to Q&A, we would like to thank the DocuSign team, our customers and our partners for their tremendous efforts during last year's unprecedented journey. We're driving the next phase of our strategy to better enable our teams to help customers digitize their agreement processes and fully capture the potential of the $50 billion Agreement Cloud market. In the near term, while we ramp and strengthen our demand-gen motion, we are confident in the opportunity that lies ahead for the Agreement Cloud and are encouraged about the broader market opportunity we're seeing on the horizon. We remain focused on delivering solid results for our shareholders. With that, thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at the customer and user conference Momentum in a few weeks on April 4 and 5. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi.\nTyler Radke: I wanted to first start about the go-to-market changes that you're making. Obviously, some new kind of sales leadership moving around. Maybe if you could help us unpack kind of the relative size of these changes and how they compare relative to your initial expectations last quarter. And then how are you just thinking about the timing for when demand starts to rebound? Is this a Q3, Q4 event? How are you building that into your forecast?\nDaniel Springer: Yes. So Tyler, first, at the high level, I would say there are substantial changes to go-to-market organization that we're bringing in an overall new leader for success and sales, which is 60%, 65% of our company. So I would say that is, from a headcount standpoint, very substantial. In addition, we've already made virtually a complete sort of change-out, if you will, of the sales leadership in North America. So I mentioned we have -- if you think about our segments, we have the SMB, the commercial and the enterprise. We have new leaders in North America coming from great scaled companies like Oracle and Salesforce.com, and those leaders are over the SMB and commercial, and we are very close to finalizing a new enterprise leader. So North America is where we had our biggest challenges that we talked about from the headwinds at the end of last year. And so that is absolutely where we're focused. We have not -- since I joined the company 5 years ago, had anything sort of close to this change in the go-to-market team. And then to your second question on the timing, I don't have an ability to tell you exactly which quarter we see those changes having which level of impact. If you take a look at -- Cynthia has provided guidance to give you a sense that we think it's -- significant changes are required to the business. And our aspiration is to move as quickly as we can to try to have that impact as quickly as possible, get us back to the long-term growth rates that we're highly confident we will get to.\nTyler Radke: Great. And second question, you talked about seeing some CLM deals and that being a focus for some of the upsell motion. Can you just talk about how CLM is performing relative to your expectations? And do these go-to-market changes help to elevate CLM more? Just help us understand how you're thinking about that relative to the core eSig.\nDaniel Springer: Yes. Absolutely. In fact, we didn't go in too much detail. But what we've done, as you think about what we said last quarter, we realized we really needed to get our field focusing. And for us, field is, again, not just their sales team, but it's also the success team that is so critical to driving the adoption that we get and then the consumption, which leads to that future growth, to get them focused on our core eSignature and eSignature Plus products. And we are hugely excited about but also focused on that execution. So part of the challenge as we were onboarding AEs and other field personnel throughout last year, we were asking them to be really able to sell the entire DocuSign Agreement Cloud. We wanted them to sort of put more things in the bag, if you will. I think what we realized it was defocusing folks from the core eSignature business. So we've pulled out a dedicated CLM team. And the purpose is both to address your question, hey, do we get enough focus on training sellers to really be competitive to win in what is a competitive market there? It's different than the leadership position we have in eSignature. But also, it frees up our traditional field to focus on the eSignature and eSignature Plus opportunity, which is critical to our overall Agreement Cloud success. So those are the changes we made. We think those are substantial change, and we think that should be significant to help us, again, drive focus on both areas of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Can you characterize what the sales pipeline looked like at the end of the quarter versus what it looked like coming into the quarter?\nDaniel Springer: So I mean, we don't have sort of a pipe metric that we would sort of disclose or share. But I can tell you from a standpoint of we build pipe in 2 different ways in terms of 2 different time frames. So right now, we are building pipe focused on Q2 as a primary goal. But if you get down to our SMB and the sort of the bottom half of the commercial business, quite a bit of the pipe that we generate actually can close in quarter. So I think what we're seeing right now is a significant increase in our achievement of our pipeline goals today than where we were a quarter ago. But again, some of those things were for this quarter, and some would be for the quarter ahead.\nSterling Auty: Understood. And then one follow-up. Can you give us a sense of what the net dollar retention expectation is that's kind of built into the guidance that you gave?\nDaniel Springer: Yes. We don't guide to that metric. And Cynthia, I don't know if you have any color you would add to net retention going forward.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So I would think Q4, we landed at the 119%, which was at the high end of our historic range. For Q1, we would expect to be within range between the 112% and 119%. That has been our historic range. But it's not, Sterling, as you know, a metric that we've traditionally guided to, though we have tried to give color about what we're seeing there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: First, I wanted to just start on the billings guidance for next year. Look, it does imply a little bit of an acceleration, perhaps more than a little bit depending on how we think about seasonality, in the back half of FY '23 relative to what you're guiding to in Q1. Can you maybe walk us through the dynamics there? What's giving you confidence in that acceleration outside of the obvious easy comps? And I guess, maybe alongside that, look, I mean, your stock is down to -- in the aftermarket where it was before COVID even happened and pulled forward all this demand. I guess why even provide a billings guide if that calls for a good amount of acceleration in the back half of the year? Is that based on pipeline, something that you're seeing to be able to give that level of confidence just given how quickly these sort of things change? And then I've got a follow-up.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. So I think I'll start, and then I'm sure Dan will have some good thoughts as well. So I think just to level set on Q1, if you think back to early fiscal '22, we continue to benefit, particularly in Q1 of last year, from the macro tailwinds coming out of the year prior, right, with strong residual customer demand. And we talked on the Q1 call last year about some of the dynamics around that, which included accelerated consumption and expansion, things like onetime use cases that fell into Q1, and then early renewals played a big dynamic. So if you think about that as macro tailwinds that helped us in Q1 last year, we have kind of the opposite in terms of some headwinds this year. So I'd say, when you look at the Q1 guide, you have to remember that last Q1 was exceptional, and it was a pretty extraordinary quarter. And so we've really been tapering off of those levels since this time last year, and we expect to build back over the next few quarters as some of these go-to-market initiatives take hold. So I'd kind of leave you with that thought, particularly as we look at the Q1 numbers.\nDaniel Springer: And the only thing I'd add to that is that if you take a look at the level of execution that, that implies, while it's increasing, as you said, across the year, we're also revamping, as Tyler asked about earlier, our go-to-market organization. And just to be really clear, we've not performed the way we would like to perform at the end of this year. At the beginning of this year, we're not going to be yet back to the performance we'd like to have. It is going to take a little bit of time. So we're quite optimistic that as the new leadership gets a chance to get embedded that we have this incredible market opportunity and this really large customer base as you saw the numbers increasing at good rates with 60,000 new adds just in the last quarter. So we've got a lot of opportunity for our land and expand motion. So we are confident that our teams will rise to that occasion and then drive that improved performance throughout the year.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I wanted to look at international. So international decelerated by a pretty dramatic magnitude from Q3 to Q4. Maybe walk us through what's going on in international, how we should be thinking about that going forward. I mean especially because, look, as we've talked about before, international feels like it should be a lot more underpenetrated and, maybe as a result, shouldn't be suffering from the lack of demand generation to the same extent as the U.S. And yet, we're seeing 13 points of decel from Q3 to Q4. So maybe can you walk us through what's going on internationally as well?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, I'll start with that one. So on international, we were quite pleased with the performance in Q4 and for the year, right? So 24% of our revenue came from international, and it was a 55% growth rate year-over-year. So again, we were quite pleased with the performance. We saw a particular strength in EMEA and APJ around some of the initiatives and investments we've made there. So I would say we would expect that to continue. As we look into the year, we're making a lot of international investments. And in some ways, it's really our biggest growth opportunity when we look across the business is international.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair.\nJacob Roberge: Just wanted to touch base. You mentioned some of your ancillary products like remote online notary and ID verification on the call. I was just kind of curious how that's tracking at the start of this year and what your expectations for these markets are over the next few years and when we could really just expect those to be a more material portion of your revenue base.\nDaniel Springer: Yes. So two thoughts, one, obviously, the starting point, particularly something like notary, which really wasn't until Q4 that we had, what I'd say, significant sales success there. So very, very small numbers. But from a growth standpoint, quite substantial. We were 4x where we sort of thought we were going to be in Q4 in terms of that sales growth. And we've now really added a quite reasonable number of customers. Our challenge now moves to that success part of the organization that we talked about, which is making sure that the folks adopt and really integrate that notary into their overall business. So we're excited about that. And when we look at your questions around identity, I think it's the single biggest sort of, if you will, eSign Plus product category we have. And our enthusiasm there is quite high that, that will continue to grow into being eventually a meaningful contributor as you asked about. So we're, again, early low numbers, but that's been a real bright spot for us as we finished up Q4.\nJacob Roberge: Awesome. And then just as a follow-up, just curious if there was anything to call out really from a competition or a churn perspective. If -- or is this really just a function of customers in real estate and financial services, just given mortgage refinancings and everything are just so down this year? Is this really just a matter of those customers that overbought and are rationalizing agreements? Or are you seeing the space in eSignature become more competitive this year?\nDaniel Springer: Yes. So two things. Cynthia and I, before we turn this call, have a review with our pricing and competition team to see if there is anything that we see differently. There's -- again, this quarter is nothing substantially different there. We don't see any meaningful change in pricing or competitive sort of intensity. In addition, when I think about the conversations I have in the field with customers, we continue to see people quite positively talk about DocuSign as a dramatic market leader with significant product capabilities and differentiation. So we don't see that changing. I think your -- to your hypothesis, absolutely, the phenomenon of the aggressive demand we saw a year ago is the biggest piece, that macro change. I would also tell you that your insight around financial services, not so much real estate, not the actual real estate industry, but the mortgage space or other financial services, they were the industries along with health care, life sciences and government that most aggressively -- and we're primarily talking about North America here, but most aggressively expanded over those 6 or 7 quarters where COVID was so meaningful. And therefore, they probably had the most on the shelf, if you will, from a product standpoint and are now saying, \"Hey, we love DocuSign. We're not interested in working with someone other than DocuSign. But we have a lot of product. And so we're going to grow at lower rates until we sort of get all of that consumed.\" So that's how I would characterize that.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. And the only other thing that I would add is just -- Dan is spot-on, but on the verticals. Just as a reminder, we don't have any vertical concentration. So we always try to give a little bit of texture around the verticals. But I would say one of the great things about DocuSign is we touch all verticals and smallest customers, the biggest customers and then we're in 180 countries. So it's a quite diversified customer base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Two quick questions on just high level. As far as the changes that you guys are making to the sales organization, is there anything different that's happening in the changes that are being made in the U.S. versus what needs to be made in international?\nDaniel Springer: Yes. Dramatically different. As we talked about a little bit, it may not have been clear enough on the prepared comments, Stan. We felt we had made the moves to really solidify our leadership in both success and sales in our core international markets. So in APJ, LATAM and in EMEA, which is our biggest international market, we're excited. We're not making changes to the leadership there. We're trying to integrate the sort of performance there by having the success in the sales team to work more closely together. I think they're already naturally doing that in those markets better than we're doing in the U.S., but we even want to sort of push that even further to ensure we're bringing that core motion of sign up a customer, get that land that we talk about, drive the adoption and the success, which then leads right into the expansion opportunity. We really want to really refine that. In North America, it's quite different. As I said, we're actually replacing the core North American sales leadership. And by the way, many of those people have done incredible work for DocuSign and will have other roles in DocuSign. It's not that we're necessarily pushing anyone out of the company. But we see an opportunity to bring in additional in the SMB, commercial and enterprise level, a new leadership there that's had more scale experience, which is related to the fact that our North American business is still 76% of our revenue and so, therefore, significantly a higher scale than any of the international markets. So that's where the changes that we're making to the sales leadership are occurring.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up, just on fiscal '23 billings guide. With billings guide essentially implying what was calling roughly 15% growth, if net revenue retention stays in the typical 112% to 119% range, it almost feels like there's limited implied new customer acquisition. So maybe just kind of walk us through how are you thinking about pace of new logo acquisitions into fiscal '23 because, obviously, it continues to be very strong. So what's implied in that guidance there?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Thanks for the question. So as you know, we always give our best view of what we're seeing kind of where we're sitting in the year, in the quarter. And so we're very consistent in terms of how we give the guide. I think when you think about the net adds, we're very pleased with the net new adds that we added during the course of the year and in Q4. And remember, we have a land and expand model. And so the net new each period doesn't necessarily contribute the largest dollars when you're looking at some of the metrics like billings or revenue. But the land and expand, we are very focused on landing new customers because they become the expansions of tomorrow, but they tend to start out very small, expand in small increments over time. And so that is as well built into the guide. But it is a land and expand model as we think about whether it's revenue or billings.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Maybe I'll direct this one to Cynthia. Cynthia, your operating margin guide for fiscal '23 was a little bit higher actually than I was thinking. And I think a lot of people thought it might be a little bit lower given DocuSign's got a big need to invest, wage inflation, an uptick in T&E costs, but it's only down 2 points from your peak. Can you talk through what perhaps some of the offsets to those sources of cost pressures are that got you landing at the 18% number?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So the guide is 16% to 18% coming off of kind of the peak, that was, I guess, 20%-ish, right, during the course of last year. And we've been talking about this since Q1 of last year when we saw the revenue upside that we would expect the margin to come down. And we're very focused on investing for growth. We're investing a lot, both in kind of the go-to-market initiatives that we've been talking about, sales capacity, success and marketing but also product innovation. And then remember, we've also doubled our business in a very short period of time in the last 2 years-ish. We've doubled the top line, and so we're also investing quite a bit kind of across the operations to really support the scale and the growth that we're at. So we think we have the right level of investment. As we move through the year, if we see opportunity to invest more for growth and invest productively, we will. But right now, we're looking at 16% to 18% margin, and we think that's a reasonable investment level to invest back into the business and invest for growth.\nKarl Keirstead: And Cynthia, as a follow-up, does that assume any change in average cash comp structure at DocuSign in order to attract and retain employees?\nCynthia Gaylor: We're always evaluating kind of the -- it's a very competitive talent market for -- both for the employees we have and folks who may join us along the way. So we're always evaluating that and looking to be market-competitive, whether it's on cash comp or how we look at the equity. And so yes to both of those.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBradley Sills: I think, Dan, when we spoke last quarter, it sounded like the pivot towards expand wasn't going to be such a big change. It is a motion that the company had been successful with in the past, and it seems like it was more of new hires just hadn't been trained on that kind of motion, given all the demand for new orders that were coming in. It seems now as though perhaps this -- with the leadership changes that you're talking about that perhaps it's a bigger undertaking that you might have expected back then. Is that a fair assessment? I guess how would you gauge the efforts so far to kind of retool towards that expand that you've been embarking on now?\nDaniel Springer: Yes. It's a good question. I'd ask -- I think about it in 2 different pieces. I think the challenge to sort of get what we internally call the DocuSign way, which is that way we enable our field to sell and lead with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. And in most cases, people do start with eSignature. And if you're talking about our existing customers, it's expansion of the core signature land that we've had as well as integrating the eSign Plus products and other products like CLM.  I think that we started off and feel like that was the right effort, and the investment we're making there feels, I think, good, and we think we'll be able to roll that out. We just had our GKO a few weeks ago, and we felt rolling out that new methodology and approach to try to get that consistency that you're asking about that we talked about is spot-on. I'd say incremental to that as we were examining what we're doing right and what we're not doing right in our overall go-to-market, we realized we did have some gaps in the scaled experience and our leadership, which is what led us to make the significant changes we've already made in North America and the decision to bring in a truly scaled overall success and sales leader. So I think the changes that we thought we were going to make are kind of running, I would say, more or less on track. And we also realized that we wanted to make enhancements to the leadership in the go-to-market team, and that's what we announced today. So I think we're, again, more or less on that same track, but we did not necessarily know when we were diving in a few months back that we would think it made sense to make those significant changes we're making in the leadership.\nBradley Sills: Understood, Dan. One more, if I may, please. I think last quarter, you mentioned that consumption patterns and demand on consumption was kind of in line with your expectations. Would you say that's the same this quarter? Any comment there?\nDaniel Springer: Make sure I clarify the question. When you're saying consumption, is a word we use for meaning different things. Are you talking about usage of the eSignature platform?\nBradley Sills: Yes, usage and volumes, envelope volumes.\nDaniel Springer: Yes. Yes. So I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is sort of the amount that we sell, if you will, and the amount that gets utilized. We saw pressure on what gets sold for 2 different reasons. One was consumption related, were not significantly off, including consumptions growing, but it was not growing the same way it was growing during the COVID years when we had that heightened demand and so many new use cases that people hadn't had before. And quite frankly, we also had a lot of onetime use cases, things like PPE loans. And so now if you look at consumption, if you adjust for things like those onetime use cases and the heightened demand, I don't see any dramatic change in our consumption. But those are meaningful. So as Cynthia said, they have a meaningful impact on our financials for Q1, and really, the first half of this year, some of those use cases going away. And keep in mind, when you think about the growth rate, if someone says, I'm putting in 1 million signatures for some onetime use cases, not only do you lose those millions, so you go the wrong direction, but there's no chance to upsell them. It was a onetime use case. So it weighs down on the growth of consumption and upselling for the overall from that base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAllan Verkhovski: This is Allan Verkhovski on for Alex. I wanted to touch on the revenue guidance. I haven't seen you guys guide for flat sequential revenues before. So can you just unpack the puts and takes there? Is there any incremental prudence within your guide, especially as to how it relates to contribution you can see from EMEA?\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think when you look at the revenue guide, it's similar to my comments earlier. We're guiding to the visibility we have given the current environment. There's probably 2 key drivers on revenue behind the guide. One is headwinds from some of the onetime use cases rolling off or renewing at lower levels. The second is just the timing of deals rolling into the quarter and deals rolling out of the quarter. So I'd say that's kind of on revenue specifically. But I would also just reiterate some of the comments I made on a relative basis to Q1 of last year and kind of just the unusual quarter that, that was on a comparative basis.\nAllan Verkhovski: Got it. And nothing else incremental in terms of how you're thinking about EMEA contribution for the full year?\nCynthia Gaylor: EMEA, like from a geo perspective?\nAllan Verkhovski: Yes, just given everything going on there and in the world.\nCynthia Gaylor: Oh, I see, just the...\nDaniel Springer: Macro.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, from a macro perspective. So yes, so I think what we would say there is we haven't seen a big impact to our business. It's a horrible humanitarian crisis and tragedy, but we haven't seen impact. But EMEA is a large business for us, so it is something that we are looking at closely. And I would just say we are supporting kind of efforts there through our global impact initiatives from a broader perspective, less to do with our business. But it's something we're watching closely, but we haven't seen much, if any, impact there at where we currently sit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nPeter Burkly: This is actually Peter Burkly on for Kirk. I guess just first, you guys have talked about in the past how -- getting the $5 billion in revenue, that's going to become a large part from eSignature. I'm just curious given you're seeing a lot of strength in some of these ancillary products, a little bit of a slowdown in the eSignature piece. Curious if you're thinking any differently about the balance between that. And I guess, the incremental investments, whether there's any change in investing for -- investing in the cross-sell motion versus the continued investments that you're making to remedy the demand generation aspects.\nDaniel Springer: Yes. I don't think there's any meaningful change on either of those dimensions. As we talked about before, we think it is very early in the eSignature. Just on the eSignature alone, right, we talked about that $25 billion TAM. And as I said, we were definitely less than 10% of that. And given our strong market share that we have in this space, I'm not sure that the whole industry is much past 10% penetration there. So I don't think there's anything that suggests to us we'd be less aggressive or bullish on having that be the primary growth opportunity for us. We are very excited about the Agreement Cloud opportunity broadly, but there's nothing that's happened that would change my bullishness on the primary opportunity being eSignature, particularly if you add what we call it eSignature Plus. Those are those other functionality we talked about like a notary capability, like an identity capability. I think when you add those in, yes, we're squarely focused on the core business.\nPeter Burkly: Awesome. That's helpful, Dan. And I guess, if I could just follow up with one more. I think the large customer growth actually is one of the more impressive metrics I'm looking at, grew that metric by plus-40% again. So I guess, just curious if there's anything to highlight in terms of what's driving the strength there. Are these larger customers thinking more strategically about the broader Agreement Cloud solutions? Or is it still -- for those large customers specifically, it's still just a function of continuing to expand their eSignature usage?\nDaniel Springer: So some of each, actually. And if you think about it, we talked about a couple of examples like a large pharmacy company that was not a significant signature company, a signature user of us. And then they got excited about CLM. And not only did that create the opportunity for growth there, but it unlocked significantly more use cases around signature once they thought about us in a CLM and a CLM-plus mindset. So I think the answer is it's definitely some of both. From an allocation, signature is still, by far, the biggest driver of the increase in customers moving up to that large customer scale for us. And again, the vast majority of our customers still have only a small number of use cases, which points again to 2 things: one, tremendous opportunity; but also, as I've said, we have to own that we haven't executed well enough against that significant opportunity. Because aside from the macro pieces we talked about, a part of this is us doing that fantastic job we need to do and we have done traditionally around that land and then get the success motion and get the upsell motion going. So that's there for us. We just have to execute.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham.\nScott Berg: Dan and Cynthia, I'll actually just leave it with 1 since we're up against the clock. Dan, I wanted to ask or drill down a little bit more on the change in CRO with the new field sales leader that will eventually join. You're making a lot of changes to the organization before this new leader comes in. I guess how should we think about that kind of dynamic? Because on one hand, you feel pretty confident about the changes you're making. But what if the sales leader comes in and wants to make additional changes, how do we think about kind of that scenario? And with regards to the time frame of when you can start kind of producing at the levels that you really expected to?\nDaniel Springer: Well, I mean, it's a good question. Obviously, something we think a lot about, and it's difficult to speculate, right, on a double level of what that person might want to do and then how we would think about reaction. Obviously, we're not going to bring in a person that has that kind of experience and that kind of scale in their background and say, your hands are tied, you can't make any changes to the go-to-market organization, for sure.  But the changes we've made aren't so much dramatically changing the way we do things. We already talked about what we were building out last quarter around the DocuSign way. These changes are really about saying, we need to have more scaled leadership. We have lots of fantastic people at DocuSign. We didn't have enough people who had seen this level of scale. And so I am confident that the new leader that comes into this role, she or he will look and say, \"This is fantastic. You guys have already set me up with a fantastic set of scaled leaders across North America and across the international geographies. You've got folks that have hit their stride at DocuSign and are driving that much higher growth already than we have in North America.\" So I feel like we're handing, again, her or him a fantastic hand. But of course, you're right that if the person had different perspectives or other folks that they thought or structured that made sense to change, we, of course, engage with them in a constructive way on that. But my belief is it's nothing but goodness with the changes we've made.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Dan Springer for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Springer: Yes, I'll be quick. Guys, I want to point out a couple of quick things. We really do feel good about the solid finish to the year, hitting that milestone of $2 billion of revenue, we're excited, right? We've been talking a lot about $2 billion aside, but we had to hit $2 billion first, so we're glad to do that. And exiting the year at 45% growth, another fantastic annual growth rate. It just -- I think it points to the opportunity that we have here. We are building out what I think is going to be a really strong, durable franchise that already starts from a fantastic position of clear market leadership. We have a massive TAM and opportunity ahead of us. And we have to execute now, and we will execute now. So we're looking forward to seeing you all in the coming months. Thank you very much for joining us.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we had a solid finish to the year. While fiscal '22 unfolded differently than we initially anticipated with the first half stronger than expected and the back half slowing faster than anticipated, net-net, we achieved most of our financial and operating goals for the year. We scaled to become a multibillion-dollar business and achieved record cash flow and operating margins, successfully balancing growth and profitability. We continue to build out our Agreement Cloud portfolio with the addition of multiple new products and capabilities to further digitize agreement workflows, and we helped 280,000 new customers begin their digital journey. With that, let me turn to the Q4 and fiscal 2022 results. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 35% year-over-year to $581 million and subscription revenue grew 37% year-over-year to $564 million. For the full year, total revenue reached $2.1 billion, an increase of 45% over last year and subscription revenue hit $2 billion, an increase of 47%. Our international revenue continued to outpace our domestic growth at 55% year-over-year to $138 million in the fourth quarter, contributing 24% of total revenue. For the full year, international revenue grew over 68% to $481 million, representing 23% of our total revenue and reflecting our accelerated expansion across geographies. Fourth quarter billings rose 25% year-over-year to $670 million, leading to a 4-quarter rolling average of 37%. For the full year, billings increased 37% to $2.4 billion. With the addition of nearly 60,000 new customers in the fourth quarter, our total installed base grew 31% for the full year with over 1.17 million customers worldwide. We added 10,000 new direct customers in Q4 and 45,000 for the year, a 36% increase year-over-year, bringing our total to 170,000 direct customers. Customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grew 42% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 852 customers. We achieved 119% dollar net retention for the quarter, at the high end of our historic range. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 81% compared with 80% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was 82% compared to 79% a year ago. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 85%, consistent with last year. For the full year, subscription gross margin was 85% versus 84% a year ago. Q4 non-GAAP operating profit reached $104 million compared with $75 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 18% compared to 17% last year. For the full year, non-GAAP operating profit rose 132% to $419 million, and operating margin was 20% versus 12% in fiscal '21. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $100 million compared with $77 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, net income was $411 million, up from $182 million in fiscal '21, a growth rate of 125% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 7,461 employees, an increase of 33% over last year. We exited the year with $898 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter grew 41% year-over-year to $88 million or a 15% margin. This compares with $62 million or 14% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was $70 million or 12% margin compared to $44 million or 10% in the prior year, a 60% increase year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow grew 71% to $506 million or a 24% margin compared to $297 million or 20% a year ago. And free cash flow more than doubled, growing at 107% year-over-year to $445 million or 21% margin compared to $215 million or 15% margin in fiscal '21. Additionally, we continue to invest for the health of our planet through our sustainability initiatives. Our products have helped save over 55 billion sheets of paper and 6 million trees so far, and we achieved carbon-neutral status this year. We are continuing our efforts to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050 as part of the business ambition pledge by committing to setting science-based targets aligned with a 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory for a net-zero future. Let me now turn to our guidance. As Dan mentioned, early in fiscal '22, we continue to benefit from macro tailwinds with strong residual customer demand. Today, while we see the lingering effects tapering from the heightened demand we saw a year ago, we expect to see a slower start to fiscal 2023 while we progress our go-to-market initiatives over the next few quarters. As we gain traction and execute against our strategy, we continue to win new customers and support existing customer success and expansion. We expect to see the related growth contribution picking up as we move through the year. We have worked diligently to incorporate the above factors into our current outlook. With that, let's turn to guidance. Total revenue of $579 million to $583 million in Q1 or growth of 24% year-over-year and $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $562 million to $566 million in Q1 or a growth of 24% to 25% year-over-year and $2.39 billion to $2.41 billion for fiscal '23 or a growth of 18% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $573 million to $583 million in Q1 or growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year and $2.71 billion to $2.73 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q1 and fiscal '23. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 16% to 18% for both Q1 and fiscal '23. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, including undrawn revolver fees related to our credit facility. For fiscal '23, we expect a tax provision of approximately $4 million to $8 million. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for both Q1 and fiscal '23. Additionally, our Board authorized a $200 million open market share repurchase program. This program underscores our confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business and allows us to flexibly leverage our balance sheet to efficiently deliver returns to our shareholders. Our primary focus will continue to be investing for long-term growth, particularly in sales capacity and enablement, marketing, product innovation and the scaling of our operations, as we are still in the early stages of this large and growing market opportunity. Before turning to Q&A, we would like to thank the DocuSign team, our customers and our partners for their tremendous efforts during last year's unprecedented journey. We're driving the next phase of our strategy to better enable our teams to help customers digitize their agreement processes and fully capture the potential of the $50 billion Agreement Cloud market. In the near term, while we ramp and strengthen our demand-gen motion, we are confident in the opportunity that lies ahead for the Agreement Cloud and are encouraged about the broader market opportunity we're seeing on the horizon. We remain focused on delivering solid results for our shareholders. With that, thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at the customer and user conference Momentum in a few weeks on April 4 and 5. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Yes. So I would think Q4, we landed at the 119%, which was at the high end of our historic range. For Q1, we would expect to be within range between the 112% and 119%. That has been our historic range. But it's not, Sterling, as you know, a metric that we've traditionally guided to, though we have tried to give color about what we're seeing there. Sure. So I think I'll start, and then I'm sure Dan will have some good thoughts as well. So I think just to level set on Q1, if you think back to early fiscal '22, we continue to benefit, particularly in Q1 of last year, from the macro tailwinds coming out of the year prior, right, with strong residual customer demand. And we talked on the Q1 call last year about some of the dynamics around that, which included accelerated consumption and expansion, things like onetime use cases that fell into Q1, and then early renewals played a big dynamic. So if you think about that as macro tailwinds that helped us in Q1 last year, we have kind of the opposite in terms of some headwinds this year. So I'd say, when you look at the Q1 guide, you have to remember that last Q1 was exceptional, and it was a pretty extraordinary quarter. And so we've really been tapering off of those levels since this time last year, and we expect to build back over the next few quarters as some of these go-to-market initiatives take hold. So I'd kind of leave you with that thought, particularly as we look at the Q1 numbers. Yes, I'll start with that one. So on international, we were quite pleased with the performance in Q4 and for the year, right? So 24% of our revenue came from international, and it was a 55% growth rate year-over-year. So again, we were quite pleased with the performance. We saw a particular strength in EMEA and APJ around some of the initiatives and investments we've made there. So I would say we would expect that to continue. As we look into the year, we're making a lot of international investments. And in some ways, it's really our biggest growth opportunity when we look across the business is international. Yes. And the only other thing that I would add is just -- Dan is spot-on, but on the verticals. Just as a reminder, we don't have any vertical concentration. So we always try to give a little bit of texture around the verticals. But I would say one of the great things about DocuSign is we touch all verticals and smallest customers, the biggest customers and then we're in 180 countries. So it's a quite diversified customer base. Yes. Thanks for the question. So as you know, we always give our best view of what we're seeing kind of where we're sitting in the year, in the quarter. And so we're very consistent in terms of how we give the guide. I think when you think about the net adds, we're very pleased with the net new adds that we added during the course of the year and in Q4. And remember, we have a land and expand model. And so the net new each period doesn't necessarily contribute the largest dollars when you're looking at some of the metrics like billings or revenue. But the land and expand, we are very focused on landing new customers because they become the expansions of tomorrow, but they tend to start out very small, expand in small increments over time. And so that is as well built into the guide. But it is a land and expand model as we think about whether it's revenue or billings. Yes. So the guide is 16% to 18% coming off of kind of the peak, that was, I guess, 20%-ish, right, during the course of last year. And we've been talking about this since Q1 of last year when we saw the revenue upside that we would expect the margin to come down. And we're very focused on investing for growth. We're investing a lot, both in kind of the go-to-market initiatives that we've been talking about, sales capacity, success and marketing but also product innovation. And then remember, we've also doubled our business in a very short period of time in the last 2 years-ish. We've doubled the top line, and so we're also investing quite a bit kind of across the operations to really support the scale and the growth that we're at. So we think we have the right level of investment. As we move through the year, if we see opportunity to invest more for growth and invest productively, we will. But right now, we're looking at 16% to 18% margin, and we think that's a reasonable investment level to invest back into the business and invest for growth. We're always evaluating kind of the -- it's a very competitive talent market for -- both for the employees we have and folks who may join us along the way. So we're always evaluating that and looking to be market-competitive, whether it's on cash comp or how we look at the equity. And so yes to both of those. Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think when you look at the revenue guide, it's similar to my comments earlier. We're guiding to the visibility we have given the current environment. There's probably 2 key drivers on revenue behind the guide. One is headwinds from some of the onetime use cases rolling off or renewing at lower levels. The second is just the timing of deals rolling into the quarter and deals rolling out of the quarter. So I'd say that's kind of on revenue specifically. But I would also just reiterate some of the comments I made on a relative basis to Q1 of last year and kind of just the unusual quarter that, that was on a comparative basis. EMEA, like from a geo perspective? Oh, I see, just the... Yes, from a macro perspective. So yes, so I think what we would say there is we haven't seen a big impact to our business. It's a horrible humanitarian crisis and tragedy, but we haven't seen impact. But EMEA is a large business for us, so it is something that we are looking at closely. And I would just say we are supporting kind of efforts there through our global impact initiatives from a broader perspective, less to do with our business. But it's something we're watching closely, but we haven't seen much, if any, impact there at where we currently sit."

            "name": "Daniel Springer",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you today as we'll cover our performance for the quarter and for the entire fiscal year. We'll talk in more detail about some important sales wins and recent innovations that continue to bring our vision for the Agreement Cloud to life. Finally, we'll look ahead to our focus areas for fiscal '23. I'd like to start by sharing a few observations about the quarter. Q4 total revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $581 million with an 18% non-GAAP operating margin. Billings grew 25% year-over-year in the quarter. International revenue grew 55% year-over-year. We added nearly 60,000 new customers in the quarter, and that's a 31% increase year-over-year. And we continue to see strong net dollar retention of 119% in Q4, which is at the high end of our historical range. Looking at the year, we grew revenue 45% to over $2 billion and billings by 37% to over $2.35 billion. We added more than 280,000 new customers, ending the year with over 1.17 million customers in total. These results reflect our team's unwavering dedication amid the macro challenges and the needed shifts in our business coming out of COVID. They also showcased continued tailwinds for the digitization of agreement workflows for businesses of every shape and size. We recognize, of course, that fiscal year '22 had 2 distinct chapters that contribute to our growth story. During the peak of the pandemic, urgent need drove dramatic acceleration of purchases, and our sales focus was squarely set on meeting that elevated demand. This motion carried through the first half of fiscal year '22. In the second half of the year, there were more challenging macro conditions impacting our customers' priorities. We saw a diminished level of urgency in their buying patterns. Customers turned their focus to investments and projects that were delayed during the heart of the pandemic. As we saw urgent demand wane, we have just begun to shift in our sales motion, back to a demand generation mode of cross-sell, upsell and departmental expansion. While we excel at demand generation for many years pre-COVID, ultimately, the shift in customer buying patterns coming out of the pandemic was quicker than we anticipated, and we didn't move fast enough as an organization. Our move from capturing high volumes of customer demand to reverting back to generating demand is now well underway. We expect this work will continue through fiscal year 2023 as we make tangible progress moving through the year. At over $2 billion in annual revenue, we believe we're still very early in the first 10% of the $50 billion Agreement Cloud market opportunity. Digital transformation remains a high priority for businesses at every scale in every industry. Given our strong brand, a leading market position and product differentiation, DocuSign is uniquely positioned to lead and capture that market opportunity with eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud. As the pandemic subside and people begin to return to the office, they are not returning to paper. eSignature is clearly here to stay, and the movement toward the broader Agreement Cloud will only continue to gain prominence. We are confident we have massive market space to grow. When we think about the opportunity this year presents, it falls into 2 main buckets: the ways we're helping our customers succeed on our platform; and the innovation we're bringing to market. Last quarter, we doubled down on our global go-to-market methodology and began driving our field org to focus on expanding opportunities. As our customers scale their usage across departments and new use cases, our field approach is also evolving. To that end, we've been bolstering our field leadership with strong leaders with GMs in EMEA, APJ and LATAM, along with recent additions across North America in the commercial and SMB segments. And we're very close to finalizing a new North American enterprise sales leader as well. Importantly, we've begun a search for an executive to lead the global field organization at success and sales. This supports our goal of scaling our business to $5 billion and beyond. As part of this change, once we have secured and onboarded our new leader, Loren will transition from DocuSign. Now it's hard to think of a sales executive as having more impact on a company than Loren has had here in his 14 years, from director to North American leader to CRO. He has really built the sales organization here. And as noted above, he's leading the way as we expand the sales leadership team for our next level of scale. He'll be staying with the company this year, and he remains focused on delivering for our customers and for driving our growth. Loren will be a big part of helping us to transition to the new sales and success leader in the coming months. We're already encouraged from the results we're seeing from these efforts, as we are upselling eSignature to more departments and use cases, cross-selling our key add-ons like identity verification, notary and monitor as well as cross-selling our CLM products. For example, last quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of the world's largest insurance and financial services companies, implementing new use cases for remote online notary for affidavit, citizenship verification and claims recovery; and DocuSign verify for loans and cash out statements. By deepening their adoption of the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, they shared that the efficiency gained by their employees and independent agents enabled them to realize tremendous savings in both time and operational expense, all while improving the self-service customer experience and maintaining strict regulatory compliance. We're hearing the same story across our key verticals with new customers as well. Last quarter, one of the largest pharmacy chains in the U.S. adopted eSignature and our AI-powered CLM products as part of their ongoing digital transformation initiative. The Agreement Cloud was the answer to replacing the manual processes across their agreement systems, which were described to us as painful and time-consuming. From that initial order, we're now seeing 75 different use cases across departments and an opportunity to deliver nearly 10 million envelopes annually. Around the world, DocuSign's value prop is just as strong. Last quarter, for example, we welcome Westpac New Zealand, part of Australia's Westpac Group, to the Agreement Cloud. Like so many customers who start with DocuSign eSignature, our exceptional employee and customer experience opens the door to more use cases. For Westpac New Zealand, this led to the adoption of CLM, Gen plus send and a significant API integration, all within the first year of our relationship. The second big opportunity this fiscal year is our continued innovation to drive stickiness and deepen our roots as a multiproduct company. More users are engaging with DocuSign every day as we work to make it even easier for them to adopt more of the advanced capabilities of the Agreement Cloud, eliminating paper, automating manual processes and connecting customers to the other systems they already use. A great example is the new DocuSign eSignature app for Zoom that enables organizations to reimagine their customer agreement process with virtual face-to-face signing experiences that our customers' customers really love. Through this new partnership, our customers can now securely share, review and complete agreements right from Zoom. In the next few weeks, we'll launch a new eSignature capability called Joint Agreements for businesses with a network model. Joint Agreements allows for a single customer experience with co-management of agreements between multiple parties behind the scenes. This makes things easier for every party involved. We believe Joint Agreements will inspire large financial services firms to encourage the use of DocuSign by their networks, which often number in the tens of thousands of advisers or agents. Next month, we're also planning to launch an important new feature called Delayed Routing for DocuSign eSignature. This allows users to add timing delays during the routing process of an envelope. This fine-tuning of the agreement process has become an increasingly popular customer ask, especially for situations where regulations require a delay like some franchising agreements that require a 1-week delay for a review before they can be signed. In total, fiscal '22 results were very strong, and I'm proud of how we as a team are moving to adapt and recalibrate to address the rapidly shifting market dynamics that we're facing post-COVID. Despite the temporal headwinds, we're continuing to focus on winning both new customers and existing customer expansions and on driving continued innovation. As a clear market leader, we've got long-term momentum on our side, a vision that's unchanged and a massive TAM. The changes we're making to our go-to-market strategy will, indeed, take a few quarters to play out. But we believe we're still just scratching the surface of our long-term opportunity and are better positioned than ever for future success. Before handing it over to Cynthia to walk you through our Q4 results and the fiscal year '23 outlook in more detail, I want to take a moment to thank the DocuSign team and our customers. Together, you're inspiring us to continue pioneering. Just this week, DocuSign was named one of Fast Company's top 10 Most Innovative Enterprise Companies. It's great to see others recognize our work, but more importantly, it's a true testament to our hardworking team and the positive impact our customers are helping us make on the world. With that, Cynthia, over to you. Yes. So Tyler, first, at the high level, I would say there are substantial changes to go-to-market organization that we're bringing in an overall new leader for success and sales, which is 60%, 65% of our company. So I would say that is, from a headcount standpoint, very substantial. In addition, we've already made virtually a complete sort of change-out, if you will, of the sales leadership in North America. So I mentioned we have -- if you think about our segments, we have the SMB, the commercial and the enterprise. We have new leaders in North America coming from great scaled companies like Oracle and Salesforce.com, and those leaders are over the SMB and commercial, and we are very close to finalizing a new enterprise leader. So North America is where we had our biggest challenges that we talked about from the headwinds at the end of last year. And so that is absolutely where we're focused. We have not -- since I joined the company 5 years ago, had anything sort of close to this change in the go-to-market team. And then to your second question on the timing, I don't have an ability to tell you exactly which quarter we see those changes having which level of impact. If you take a look at -- Cynthia has provided guidance to give you a sense that we think it's -- significant changes are required to the business. And our aspiration is to move as quickly as we can to try to have that impact as quickly as possible, get us back to the long-term growth rates that we're highly confident we will get to. Yes. Absolutely. In fact, we didn't go in too much detail. But what we've done, as you think about what we said last quarter, we realized we really needed to get our field focusing. And for us, field is, again, not just their sales team, but it's also the success team that is so critical to driving the adoption that we get and then the consumption, which leads to that future growth, to get them focused on our core eSignature and eSignature Plus products. And we are hugely excited about but also focused on that execution. So part of the challenge as we were onboarding AEs and other field personnel throughout last year, we were asking them to be really able to sell the entire DocuSign Agreement Cloud. We wanted them to sort of put more things in the bag, if you will. I think what we realized it was defocusing folks from the core eSignature business. So we've pulled out a dedicated CLM team. And the purpose is both to address your question, hey, do we get enough focus on training sellers to really be competitive to win in what is a competitive market there? It's different than the leadership position we have in eSignature. But also, it frees up our traditional field to focus on the eSignature and eSignature Plus opportunity, which is critical to our overall Agreement Cloud success. So those are the changes we made. We think those are substantial change, and we think that should be significant to help us, again, drive focus on both areas of growth. So I mean, we don't have sort of a pipe metric that we would sort of disclose or share. But I can tell you from a standpoint of we build pipe in 2 different ways in terms of 2 different time frames. So right now, we are building pipe focused on Q2 as a primary goal. But if you get down to our SMB and the sort of the bottom half of the commercial business, quite a bit of the pipe that we generate actually can close in quarter. So I think what we're seeing right now is a significant increase in our achievement of our pipeline goals today than where we were a quarter ago. But again, some of those things were for this quarter, and some would be for the quarter ahead. Yes. We don't guide to that metric. And Cynthia, I don't know if you have any color you would add to net retention going forward. And the only thing I'd add to that is that if you take a look at the level of execution that, that implies, while it's increasing, as you said, across the year, we're also revamping, as Tyler asked about earlier, our go-to-market organization. And just to be really clear, we've not performed the way we would like to perform at the end of this year. At the beginning of this year, we're not going to be yet back to the performance we'd like to have. It is going to take a little bit of time. So we're quite optimistic that as the new leadership gets a chance to get embedded that we have this incredible market opportunity and this really large customer base as you saw the numbers increasing at good rates with 60,000 new adds just in the last quarter. So we've got a lot of opportunity for our land and expand motion. So we are confident that our teams will rise to that occasion and then drive that improved performance throughout the year. Yes. So two thoughts, one, obviously, the starting point, particularly something like notary, which really wasn't until Q4 that we had, what I'd say, significant sales success there. So very, very small numbers. But from a growth standpoint, quite substantial. We were 4x where we sort of thought we were going to be in Q4 in terms of that sales growth. And we've now really added a quite reasonable number of customers. Our challenge now moves to that success part of the organization that we talked about, which is making sure that the folks adopt and really integrate that notary into their overall business. So we're excited about that. And when we look at your questions around identity, I think it's the single biggest sort of, if you will, eSign Plus product category we have. And our enthusiasm there is quite high that, that will continue to grow into being eventually a meaningful contributor as you asked about. So we're, again, early low numbers, but that's been a real bright spot for us as we finished up Q4. Yes. So two things. Cynthia and I, before we turn this call, have a review with our pricing and competition team to see if there is anything that we see differently. There's -- again, this quarter is nothing substantially different there. We don't see any meaningful change in pricing or competitive sort of intensity. In addition, when I think about the conversations I have in the field with customers, we continue to see people quite positively talk about DocuSign as a dramatic market leader with significant product capabilities and differentiation. So we don't see that changing. I think your -- to your hypothesis, absolutely, the phenomenon of the aggressive demand we saw a year ago is the biggest piece, that macro change. I would also tell you that your insight around financial services, not so much real estate, not the actual real estate industry, but the mortgage space or other financial services, they were the industries along with health care, life sciences and government that most aggressively -- and we're primarily talking about North America here, but most aggressively expanded over those 6 or 7 quarters where COVID was so meaningful. And therefore, they probably had the most on the shelf, if you will, from a product standpoint and are now saying, \"Hey, we love DocuSign. We're not interested in working with someone other than DocuSign. But we have a lot of product. And so we're going to grow at lower rates until we sort of get all of that consumed.\" So that's how I would characterize that. Yes. Dramatically different. As we talked about a little bit, it may not have been clear enough on the prepared comments, Stan. We felt we had made the moves to really solidify our leadership in both success and sales in our core international markets. So in APJ, LATAM and in EMEA, which is our biggest international market, we're excited. We're not making changes to the leadership there. We're trying to integrate the sort of performance there by having the success in the sales team to work more closely together. I think they're already naturally doing that in those markets better than we're doing in the U.S., but we even want to sort of push that even further to ensure we're bringing that core motion of sign up a customer, get that land that we talk about, drive the adoption and the success, which then leads right into the expansion opportunity. We really want to really refine that. In North America, it's quite different. As I said, we're actually replacing the core North American sales leadership. And by the way, many of those people have done incredible work for DocuSign and will have other roles in DocuSign. It's not that we're necessarily pushing anyone out of the company. But we see an opportunity to bring in additional in the SMB, commercial and enterprise level, a new leadership there that's had more scale experience, which is related to the fact that our North American business is still 76% of our revenue and so, therefore, significantly a higher scale than any of the international markets. So that's where the changes that we're making to the sales leadership are occurring. Yes. It's a good question. I'd ask -- I think about it in 2 different pieces. I think the challenge to sort of get what we internally call the DocuSign way, which is that way we enable our field to sell and lead with the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. And in most cases, people do start with eSignature. And if you're talking about our existing customers, it's expansion of the core signature land that we've had as well as integrating the eSign Plus products and other products like CLM.  I think that we started off and feel like that was the right effort, and the investment we're making there feels, I think, good, and we think we'll be able to roll that out. We just had our GKO a few weeks ago, and we felt rolling out that new methodology and approach to try to get that consistency that you're asking about that we talked about is spot-on. I'd say incremental to that as we were examining what we're doing right and what we're not doing right in our overall go-to-market, we realized we did have some gaps in the scaled experience and our leadership, which is what led us to make the significant changes we've already made in North America and the decision to bring in a truly scaled overall success and sales leader. So I think the changes that we thought we were going to make are kind of running, I would say, more or less on track. And we also realized that we wanted to make enhancements to the leadership in the go-to-market team, and that's what we announced today. So I think we're, again, more or less on that same track, but we did not necessarily know when we were diving in a few months back that we would think it made sense to make those significant changes we're making in the leadership. Make sure I clarify the question. When you're saying consumption, is a word we use for meaning different things. Are you talking about usage of the eSignature platform? Yes. Yes. So I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is sort of the amount that we sell, if you will, and the amount that gets utilized. We saw pressure on what gets sold for 2 different reasons. One was consumption related, were not significantly off, including consumptions growing, but it was not growing the same way it was growing during the COVID years when we had that heightened demand and so many new use cases that people hadn't had before. And quite frankly, we also had a lot of onetime use cases, things like PPE loans. And so now if you look at consumption, if you adjust for things like those onetime use cases and the heightened demand, I don't see any dramatic change in our consumption. But those are meaningful. So as Cynthia said, they have a meaningful impact on our financials for Q1, and really, the first half of this year, some of those use cases going away. And keep in mind, when you think about the growth rate, if someone says, I'm putting in 1 million signatures for some onetime use cases, not only do you lose those millions, so you go the wrong direction, but there's no chance to upsell them. It was a onetime use case. So it weighs down on the growth of consumption and upselling for the overall from that base. Macro. Yes. I don't think there's any meaningful change on either of those dimensions. As we talked about before, we think it is very early in the eSignature. Just on the eSignature alone, right, we talked about that $25 billion TAM. And as I said, we were definitely less than 10% of that. And given our strong market share that we have in this space, I'm not sure that the whole industry is much past 10% penetration there. So I don't think there's anything that suggests to us we'd be less aggressive or bullish on having that be the primary growth opportunity for us. We are very excited about the Agreement Cloud opportunity broadly, but there's nothing that's happened that would change my bullishness on the primary opportunity being eSignature, particularly if you add what we call it eSignature Plus. Those are those other functionality we talked about like a notary capability, like an identity capability. I think when you add those in, yes, we're squarely focused on the core business. So some of each, actually. And if you think about it, we talked about a couple of examples like a large pharmacy company that was not a significant signature company, a signature user of us. And then they got excited about CLM. And not only did that create the opportunity for growth there, but it unlocked significantly more use cases around signature once they thought about us in a CLM and a CLM-plus mindset. So I think the answer is it's definitely some of both. From an allocation, signature is still, by far, the biggest driver of the increase in customers moving up to that large customer scale for us. And again, the vast majority of our customers still have only a small number of use cases, which points again to 2 things: one, tremendous opportunity; but also, as I've said, we have to own that we haven't executed well enough against that significant opportunity. Because aside from the macro pieces we talked about, a part of this is us doing that fantastic job we need to do and we have done traditionally around that land and then get the success motion and get the upsell motion going. So that's there for us. We just have to execute. Well, I mean, it's a good question. Obviously, something we think a lot about, and it's difficult to speculate, right, on a double level of what that person might want to do and then how we would think about reaction. Obviously, we're not going to bring in a person that has that kind of experience and that kind of scale in their background and say, your hands are tied, you can't make any changes to the go-to-market organization, for sure.  But the changes we've made aren't so much dramatically changing the way we do things. We already talked about what we were building out last quarter around the DocuSign way. These changes are really about saying, we need to have more scaled leadership. We have lots of fantastic people at DocuSign. We didn't have enough people who had seen this level of scale. And so I am confident that the new leader that comes into this role, she or he will look and say, \"This is fantastic. You guys have already set me up with a fantastic set of scaled leaders across North America and across the international geographies. You've got folks that have hit their stride at DocuSign and are driving that much higher growth already than we have in North America.\" So I feel like we're handing, again, her or him a fantastic hand. But of course, you're right that if the person had different perspectives or other folks that they thought or structured that made sense to change, we, of course, engage with them in a constructive way on that. But my belief is it's nothing but goodness with the changes we've made. Yes, I'll be quick. Guys, I want to point out a couple of quick things. We really do feel good about the solid finish to the year, hitting that milestone of $2 billion of revenue, we're excited, right? We've been talking a lot about $2 billion aside, but we had to hit $2 billion first, so we're glad to do that. And exiting the year at 45% growth, another fantastic annual growth rate. It just -- I think it points to the opportunity that we have here. We are building out what I think is going to be a really strong, durable franchise that already starts from a fantastic position of clear market leadership. We have a massive TAM and opportunity ahead of us. And we have to execute now, and we will execute now. So we're looking forward to seeing you all in the coming months. Thank you very much for joining us."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the website following the call. [Operator Instructions] I will now pass the call over to Annie Leschin, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAnnie Leschin: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to DocuSign\u2019s third quarter fiscal year \u201822 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have DocuSign\u2019s CEO, Dan Springer; and CFO, Cynthia Gaylor. The press release announcing our third quarter results was issued earlier today and is posted on our Investor Relations website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to let everyone know that we plan to participate virtually in a few events in the upcoming weeks, the UBS Tech Conference on December 8th; and the Needham Conference on January 10th.

Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. First, let me share the financial results. In Q3, we continued to see solid performance with our revenue and profitability. Revenue grew 42% year-over-year to $545 million and operating margin reached 22%, exceeding our guidance. International was again a bright spot at 68% year-over-year growth and now 23% of total revenue. However, we fell short of our billings guidance, coming in at 28% year-over-year growth. We expanded our customer base to 1.11 million and we continue to see strong dollar net retention of 121%. The market dynamics that we saw in the third quarter were markedly different from what we experienced in the first half of this year. With the boost from COVID-19 over the past 1.5-year, we experienced exceptionally high growth rates at scale as we captured customer demand at an unprecedented pace. As we moved through Q3 and into the second half of the year, we saw demand slow and the urgency of customers\u2019 buying patterns temper. While we had expected an eventual step-down from the peak levels of growth achieved during the height of the pandemic, the environment shifted more quickly than we anticipated, and these were the primary contributors to our billing results in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. Despite this, it\u2019s clear that we are still in the early days of the $50 billion Agreement Cloud opportunity as digital transformation remains a high priority for organizations worldwide. DocuSign is uniquely positioned to lead and capture eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud market opportunity, given our strong brand leading market position and product differentiation. Even as the pandemic subsides and people begin to return to the office, they are not returning to paper. eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud are clearly here to stay, and DocuSign\u2019s value will persist no matter how the future of work unfolds. To continue to drive growth at scale from new company acquisition to existing customer expansion, we need to ensure our teams are firing on all cylinders. We are doubling down on growth to counter recent trends by aggressively investing in two key strategic areas. First, we are increasing investment in global sales capacity, training and field enablement to speed pipeline generation with new business and to drive expansion within our customer base. We\u2019re globalizing our marketing investments across direct and channel sales to drive brand awareness and qualified sales leads, both domestically and in our expanding international markets. As part of this effort, we are aligning our worldwide sales, marketing and success operations under Chief Operating Officer, Scott Olrich. With this move, Chief Revenue Officer, Loren Alhadeff; and SVP of Customer Success, Lambert Walsh, will now report to Scott. In addition, Mike Sheridan, who has served DocuSign for over six years, first as CFO and most recently leading our international strategy, has moved on from the Company as of the end of November. I\u2019d really like to personally thank Mike for all of his many contributions to DocuSign in key roles through critical stages of our development. We all wish Mike well in his retirement. With the substantial growth of these go-to-market organizations in the last 1.5-year, we believe these moves will drive a unified motion towards demand generation, demand capture and our overall growth. The second key strategic area we\u2019re investing in is product innovation, which will continue to be an integral part of our success. I\u2019d like to touch on how we are elevating our innovation efforts across our expanded portfolio of products that make up the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. Last month, we enhanced DocuSign Notary, so administrators can manage the availability of first-party notaries, one more reason we believe that DocuSign Notary will become the tool of choice for real estate, insurance and other financial service providers. A number of financial institutions, including Fidelity, added the service in Q3, but M&T Bank is my personal favorite early success story in the space. M&T Bank has been a customer since 2018, but their DocuSign use cases jumped from about 50 to more than 200, first with the introduction of ID verification and now with notary. That\u2019s an obvious win for us, but the win for M&T Bank is they can now remotely notarized documents in less than 7 minutes. The combination of eSignature, Identity Verification and Notary are game-changers for M&T\u2019s 700 retail branches, and we\u2019re hearing that it\u2019s making a notable impact on their operating costs as well as a huge plus for their customer experience. Speaking of ID Verification, or IDV for short, last month, we also launched an enhancement that lets customers add SMS reauthentication to IDV envelopes. So after signers pass an initial IDV, they enter a pass code delivered via SMS text to access the envelope, adding an extra layer of security that our customers value, along with added convenience to our customers\u2019 customers. We\u2019ve also made a number of important enhancements to our DocuSign CLM product this quarter, helping organizations automate manual business processes and improve efficiency with every agreement. Just this month, we launched a full set of collaboration tools within the product to give users the ability to comment, tag others and assign tasks all in the CLM UI. On top of those innovations, we continue to make significant enhancements across the entire Agreement Cloud, including new Agreement Actions with Google and Microsoft apps to automate the post-signature tasks; new Delegated Signing capabilities for our enterprise customers; and new tech to simplify invoicing using our popular product, DocuSign Gen for Salesforce Billing. There\u2019s plenty more ahead to extend our leadership position and guide our customers into the next generation of agreements as our steady drumbeat of innovation continues to set us apart. We are making significant investments in both product and platform innovation as we believe it drives customer success and positions us well for durable growth going forward. On the customer front, I mentioned earlier that we added 59,000 new customers in Q3, and I\u2019d like to share two of them that are particularly relevant to our focus areas. One of our newest global customers, UPS, adopted an enterprise-wide initiative to modernize their entire contracting process with DocuSign CLM. Having previously used an alternative solution, their 9,000-plus person sales organization is now using CLM and eSignature products in conjunction with Salesforce, all integrated into one workflow. The successful deployment has led to a much faster and more efficient process with greater visibility. This is attracting the attention of other business units where we are actively exploring expansion opportunities. I think it illustrates that both eSignature and CLM can be effective on ramps into enterprise businesses, and both can open the door for deeper cross-departmental adoption rates. Solarity Credit Union in Washington State is a business that prides itself on pushing the boundaries of technology to elevate the customer experience. Solarity first looked at DocuSign to better enable their residential mortgage process with DocuSign Rooms for Mortgage. Next, they began using DocuSign Notary as a standalone offering. Then Solarity became the first DocuSign customer to fully integrate these capabilities to offer a completely digital solution for remote residential mortgage closings. I expect many more stories like Solarity as our customers move to differentiate their own customer experience with seamlessly integrated solutions. We\u2019re also continuing to deepen our relationships and drive innovation across our already thriving partner ecosystem. Building on our collaboration of over a decade, we announced an expansion of our global strategic partnership with Salesforce. Together, we expect to build new joint solutions to automate the contract process, improve the customer experience, drive faster ROI and increase collaboration amongst organizations that use Slack, which is now a part of Salesforce. This expansion reflects the fact that Salesforce and DocuSign have consistently succeeded together as partners which, in turn, has generated opportunities to partner in priority areas such as Slack for Salesforce and CLM for DocuSign. Following our eSignature integration with Microsoft Teams earlier this year, DocuSign is now also an official electronic signature provider in the Microsoft Teams\u2019 Approvals app, adding to our integration across Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics 365. This latest enhancement allows users to create, manage and share approvals directly from Teams, enabling them to streamline approval requests while keeping up to date on the status of approval. So, to wrap up, we are proactively addressing the rapid change in demand trends that are we seeing as we emerge from the pandemic by investing in the areas most critical to our future growth. Though we\u2019ve adjusted our near-term outlook to reflect the uncertainties of the current environment, we have strong confidence in our vision and strategy. We are convinced that the growth opportunity for DocuSign remains largely untapped. We have products that are loved by our customers and their customers in turn and technology that is making a difference in the global speed of business as well as the health of our planet. If the last year has shown us anything, it\u2019s just how early in the opportunity we really are. In the coming weeks and months, you will see us focus our efforts and investments to drive growth at scale. While disappointed with my execution on billings this quarter, I\u2019m highly optimistic about our long-term growth, and we remain one of the fastest-growing enterprise cloud companies in history. We will continue to innovate across our platform as we lay the foundation for our future expansion across the entire Agreement Cloud. With that, over to you, Cynthia.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. After six quarters of accelerated demand, we saw customers shift their buying patterns in the third quarter. Revenue, profitability and cash flow remain strong, while billings and dollar net retention came off their highs, especially in light of the tougher year-over-year comparables. As Dan mentioned, we had expected this to happen more gradually, and we saw a more notable shift in Q3 than anticipated. Total revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $545 million, while subscription revenue grew 44% year-over-year to $529 million. Our international business expanded at a healthy rate, especially in our Asia Pacific region this quarter. In total, international revenue grew 68% year-over-year to $128 million, contributing 23% of total revenue. Billings grew 28% year-over-year to $565 million as we were impacted by the shift in customer buying behavior, accentuated by a particularly strong first half of the year. With that said, we brought on 59,000 new customers, bringing our total customer count to 1.11 million customers worldwide, an increase of 35% compared to a year ago. We also added over 11,000 direct customers, bringing the total to nearly 160,000, an increase of 41% year-over-year. Customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grew 45% year-over-year to a total of 785 customers. After an exceptional 1.5 years of customer growth, we continue to add customers at a solid pace. For the sixth quarter in a row, we exceeded the high end of our historical range of dollar net retention, landing at 121% as our existing customers expanded their deployments of our product offerings. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 82% compared with 79% a year ago, while subscription gross margin was 86% compared with 84% a year ago. In Q3, non-GAAP operating margin reached 22% or over $122 million compared with 13% or $49 million in the third quarter of last year. Our Q3 revenue growth continued to outpace our ability to invest at a similar rate in quarter. In addition, the delayed reopening of our offices led to lower-than-expected travel and entertainment expenses. As Dan discussed, we are committed to investing for future growth with a focus on optimizing our go-to-market efforts around demand generation, along with customer success and accelerating our product development and innovation engine. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $121 million compared with $46 million in the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 7,056 employees, an increase of 32% over last year. Operating cash flow came in at $105 million or 19% margin due to continued top line outperformance. This compares with $57 million or 15% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow reached $90 million or 17% margin in the quarter compared to $38 million or 10% in the prior year. We exited Q3 with $908 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Now, let me turn to guidance. Coming off of the strong growth we experienced in the first half of the year, we\u2019ve done rigorous analysis to understand the current dynamics. As a result, we are maintaining our Q4 subscription revenue guidance and adjusting billings to take into account the risks and opportunities we see in the business. For the fourth quarter and full year fiscal \u201822, guidance is as follows: Total revenue of $557 million to $563 million in Q4 or growth of 29% to 31% year-over-year, and $2.083 billion to $2.089 billion for fiscal \u201822 or growth of 43% to 44% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $544 million to $550 million in Q4 or growth of 33% to 34% year-over-year, and $2.017 billion to $2.023 billion for fiscal \u201822 or growth of 46% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $647 million to $659 million in Q4 or growth of 21% to 23% year-over-year, and $2.335 billion to $2.347 billion for fiscal \u201822 or growth of 36% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q4 and fiscal \u201822. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 17% to 19% for Q4, and 19% to 21% for fiscal \u201822. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income. We expect a tax provision of approximately $3 million to $4 million for fiscal \u201822. We expect fully diluted weighted shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for both, Q4 and fiscal \u201822. In closing, DocuSign has become a critical component of organizations\u2019 digital transformations around the globe. While there may be some short-term fluctuations, we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy and steadfast in our commitment to top line growth as our first priority. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. So, I\u2019m wondering, at this point, what\u2019s the sense of visibility that you\u2019ve got in the business as you exit this year moving into next year? Because the billings guidance at 21% to 23% would kind of imply a growth rate that was actually slower than what it was pre-pandemic. So, just wondering if this is just kind of like a whiplash effect coming post-pandemic and any sense of what visibility you might have for growth as we exit the year would look like?\nDan Springer: So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be providing guidance for next year, as you would probably expect, Sterling. But, let me talk a little bit about sort of the sources of the change and hopefully, that will be able to give you some perspective on how we think about it. As we talked about in the comments upfront, first half of this year, we actually expected to see more of that impact coming out of the kind of the COVID extra demand we had experienced. And we didn\u2019t, right? And so, we ended up outperforming in the first half by probably more than we expected. But in the second half, we saw this now come in much more dramatically in terms of that impact of the removal of that tailwind, if you will. And I think there\u2019s sort of two components to it. One, that there is just sort of a change in the buying urgency we\u2019ve seen from customers. And throughout the COVID era, we had a lot of folks who really needed to get things in place, particularly if they had a large part of their employee base working from home and needed to leverage the benefits of the work-from-anywhere solutions that we have at DocuSign. And then, I think the second component to that is there was sort of a change in the nature of some of that buying. And we had realized that as we were an organization that had started to more fulfill demand from our go-to-market and we were doing less of what we had typically done, which was really generating more demand. And think about that land and expand motion we\u2019ve talked to you for years about. And I think that was the piece that executionally we did not forecast for because we would never forecast that we would sort of take our eye off the ball there. And I kind of own that aspect of it, where we realized we were not doing all the other motions we\u2019ve done in the past. And that\u2019s, as you see, part of the reason we\u2019re restructuring ourselves a little bit to make sure we can get back to the mode that has always been a successful part in driving that growth. So, I think you have to look at those as the kind of core components that describe what has changed. And that\u2019s why if you look for the second half, we will have a slower billings rate than we\u2019ve had traditionally. And I think it\u2019s our expectation that in the future, we want to go back to the old mode and really go after creating that demand and working with our customers that we\u2019ve always done.\nSterling Auty: Got it. And then maybe one follow-up. Can you characterize the magnitude and the timing of the investment that you\u2019re going to make in sales, so we can think about what the margin profile impact from that, as well as sales for you guys usually ramps a little bit faster than traditional enterprise software, but trying to gauge when those new sales resources might actually contribute to an improvement in that top-of-funnel lead generation.\nDan Springer: Yes. So, my view is -- and again, Cynthia can give you some more details on the P&L aspect of it. It\u2019s not so much a dramatic shift in the way we\u2019re thinking about our investment in sales. I think this is more about the quality of the execution and the coordination as opposed to a dramatic dollar impact. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in the -- to achieve that apex of the growth opportunity. But I think we\u2019ve been doing that historically as well. And we have become much more efficient with that scale. There\u2019s a lot in our model that\u2019s super attractive. And if anything, as you heard Cynthia described in the comments, we have more profitability in this last quarter even than maybe we would have liked, if that\u2019s not an oxymoron to describe. We do want to put more money to work in driving the growth, but I wouldn\u2019t think of it as some sort of step function that should dramatically change your view of our P&L over time.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. And I would just add to that, echo Dan\u2019s comments about investment for growth. We\u2019ve been talking about the past few quarters that we wouldn\u2019t expect to maintain these type of operating margin levels, right? We\u2019re kind of at our long-term target margin a lot sooner than we were expecting to be, mainly because of the top line outperformance. So, we\u2019ll continue to invest for growth, and we would expect that margin to continue to come down as we do that. The other piece that I would just mention, as Dan said, the investments that we\u2019re making are not a step function on the sales and marketing side. But one area that we are very focused on is enablement, right? If you think about the number of people and field folks that we have hired over the course of 18 months, they\u2019ve really only seen kind of one type of customer demand, and that\u2019s kind of urgent demand. So one thing that we will be investing in is making sure we\u2019re enabling folks to generate demand in addition to capture the demand that we have.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nBhavan Suri: I guess, Dan, just one more to follow up on Sterling\u2019s first question about the billings. I guess maybe it\u2019d be great if you can give some color if there were specific verticals where you might have seen some of this delay or slowdown in purchasing behavior? I guess, just trying to understand given which industries are first on in the transition were those the ones where they might have been a delay or the ones that had a benefit from COVID, financial services, whatever. I\u2019d love to sort of get a little more color on the industry. And then sort of as you look at those industries, it feels like they should have transitioned to a more proactive. We need DocuSign as opposed to having the salespeople service them. It\u2019s sort of the government or the newer verticals that need salespeople. So just help me understand sort of that dynamic too in the industry that might have been driving some of the impact on billings.\nDan Springer: Yes. In your question, the sort of proposed answer is present, right? So I think you nailed the phenomenon. Last year, if you thought about the areas where we had just considerable outperformance from what we\u2019ve expected pre-COVID, it was an industry that had actually been traditional strongholds for DocuSign, but they just accelerated. So, we saw that in financial services, we saw that in healthcare, life sciences, we saw that in some of our technology -- telecom technology areas. So that was by far the biggest drivers last year. And that is where, in Q3, when we started to see that change in demand where we saw the most notable impact in the other direction. So, not surprising, given that if you understand how we explain the phenomenon of that sort of acceleration of demand that occurred over a number of quarters that that would be the place where they would be the biggest reaction in the other direction.\nBhavan Suri: Yes. Yes, obviously, that makes sense. And I guess, the second part of my question, as you think about these sales investments, there\u2019s a number of industries where it\u2019s -- real estate, let\u2019s pick on that one where pretty much everyone gets the value and it\u2019s generally a DocuSign request that comes through with mortgages or refis or whatever. But I guess, when you think about some investments specific industries you guys are targeting, where you think the penetration rates are low or there\u2019s low-hanging fruit, or are you investing across all of these industries because there\u2019s still demand in, say, real estate or financial services or account opening or whatever?\nDan Springer: Yes. I mean, we are still underpenetrated in every geography and every vertical. When we look at the kind of the construct that we\u2019re doing about $2 billion of revenue this year and the bulk of that is still signature-centric. And we think about the TAM as being $25 billion. It\u2019s just lightly penetrated. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sort of sense of oh, in financial services or health care life sciences, we\u2019d be slowing the push there. I think it\u2019s what we need to do is execute effectively, as I described earlier, in those verticals where we already have good footprint, cross-sell opportunities into additional parts of that vertical, like other departments where we haven\u2019t yet penetrated them in certain accounts. So, I don\u2019t think you should think that we\u2019re only going to be aggressively investing in verticals that hadn\u2019t been our traditional strongholds. We think there is a lot and a lot of room to grow in the traditional strongholds as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Rich calling on for Rishi. I guess, just kind of breaking down the slowdown on the regional side. It looks like in 3Q, international growth held up pretty well. Is there anything from an international versus U.S. perspective you could call out as we kind of move forward and how we should think about it?\nDan Springer: Yes. I\u2019ll talk about the historical first and then we can talk about the future. On the historical side, it\u2019s boringly a little bit of the same answer I just gave on the vertical, right? Last year, we really outperformed our expectations more in the United States than even we did, and it was great growth internationally and international took share, but we expected it to take even more share because we had this extra sort of COVID boost that was more dramatic in the U.S. And so, similarly, as we look at Q3 and really into the whole second half of this year, that\u2019s the area where we see the hit being the hardest is in North America. And so, I think it\u2019s -- again, for the same reasons that the vertical explanation made sense, it\u2019s the same reason on geographies. So, that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s happened. Going forward, again, while we are dramatically more successful and 77% of our revenue this quarter came from our home market, our belief is that we are dramatically underpenetrated still in North America. And so, we will continue to be putting a focus on investment and growth in our overall go-to-market in North America for sure. And it is true, we believe, international because we were slower to get there. And if you think about in the past, we\u2019ve always talked about it that it\u2019s not that it\u2019s developing dramatically differently internationally than it is in North America, it\u2019s just that we got there later. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so at even higher growth rates than we see here in North America. And our expectation is we\u2019ll continue to execute well there. And our aspiration is to continue to see our international markets take share in our overall revenue as they did ticking up to 23% this quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That\u2019s super helpful. And then, I guess, just kind of it looks like there\u2019s going to be some gross margin improvement and factored into the guidance there. And just kind of wanted to maybe dive a little bit deeper on the gross margin side, if there\u2019s anything underlying from a product mix standpoint or anything to call out there?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I think, there\u2019s nothing material. I think, the gross margin guide is in line with where we\u2019ve been performing the last few quarters. And so, we would expect that to continue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Maybe just help me parse out the commentary around demand slowdown versus some of the investments that you\u2019re going to be making into the sales organization, like you mentioned, sales enablement. I guess, what I\u2019m trying to understand is how much confidence do you have that the -- if there\u2019s this demand deceleration or slowdown, that is something that you\u2019ll be able to truly fix by really doubling down on things like sales enablement and just the overall sales organization.\nDan Springer: Yes. I think there are sort of two different things. If you want to think about the three different factors, Stan, that we talked about in terms of the change from first half to second half, we always expected there to be a reduction of that really heightened COVID buying, which drove our growth rates dramatically higher than they had ever been, even as we got bigger. So we expected that. I think the piece that we didn\u2019t expect are really the other two factors. So, the one is while we would expect people to sort of return to sort of normalcy in purchasing, we didn\u2019t realize that they had been sort of well-stocked with DocuSign, if you will. And we saw some of that purchasing behavior where people were, as you said, in that heightened demand model, probably purchasing more aggressively than we would have seen in the past. And I don\u2019t think that was one that was very difficult to sort of understand and calibrate that, and we\u2019ve seen that in the behavior now. And then, the second piece that gets to the investments you were describing is really around our execution there. And the reason I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to be successful now in a sort of post-COVID or normalized environment, it\u2019s because that\u2019s the success we had before COVID, right? And I think we -- as I talked about before, I think the gap is, as I think about leading the organization there, as it got easier to sort of meet that demand versus generate that demand with that good work we do where we work with our customers, we understand the use cases where we can expand with them, we help them see those opportunities, and then we help fill against those opportunities. We stopped doing that as people just need more and more volume for their existing use cases, right? And so, I think that\u2019s the gap in our execution. And as Cynthia described, a huge portion of our field has joined since pandemic began because we\u2019ve been growing at such a rate. And we haven\u2019t done the job we need to do at enabling them at the traditional DocuSign sort of land and expand processes. So, it is sort of a back to the future mindset for us. And we have to get back to that discipline that we\u2019ve always had in the past. And that\u2019s why I, again, have that high degree of confidence. It\u2019s not a new territory for us. It\u2019s one we\u2019re very familiar with.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. And then, just the weakness that I think that we\u2019re all referring to now is mainly seen around the eSignature because that\u2019s where -- that was the big beneficiary last year. But, what are you seeing around just the broader Agreement Cloud and the momentum within the CLM space, SpringCM, Seal acquisitions that you made, when could those start -- those components start to really come on line in a minimum meaningful size to try to maybe offset some of the challenges we\u2019re seeing now on the eSignature side?\nDan Springer: Yes. Well, so two things. One, it\u2019s a little bit of a complexity as you think about those. And we talked about last year that when the focus of our customer base was you just have to help us get sort of the eSignature use cases up quickly, we became very much a fulfilled demand-oriented company. And we took some focus away from some of the broader Agreement Cloud other offerings because our customers were pulling us. I think that was the right course, right? We are a customer success-oriented company, and we needed to focus on that. So, I think now, we see ourselves, having come out of the sort of the COVID period and coming out of the first half where we see that demand changing, you will see us, I would say, reaccelerate and reemphasize our focus on the other Agreement Cloud products. And I think that we\u2019re putting a lot of focus on not just the product development, but also the go-to-market there. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to see growth and acceleration. We believe the Agreement Cloud products will take share from signature. And I think at this point, because of the scale of the eSignature business relative, and I don\u2019t just mean our piece where it\u2019s really dramatic, but even in the marketplace, things like CLM or just much smaller developed opportunities today. So, the ability to sort of become meaningful to our financials, it\u2019s going to take a while. But that\u2019s how I think about our focus and why that\u2019s so strategically important to us to build out the overall Agreement Cloud.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. And the one thing I would add to that, as Dan said, eSignature does comprise the vast majority of our revenue, but we also have a really big installed base. And so, one thing that we\u2019re really encouraged by is some of the traction we are seeing with CLM and some of the Agreement Cloud products in customers that have had success with eSignature moving to kind of a more strategic dialogue around the broader Agreement Cloud. So, we continue to see positive traction in that area, even though it will show up in the numbers for a while.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Dan, could you just talk about maybe why this quarter? I mean, is there anything specific about 3Q? I know you had a tougher comp. But is there anything seasonal? I mean, are people taking more vacations? I was just trying to get a sense of why was this quarter that sort of execution wasn\u2019t where you wanted it to be. Was it just sort of pipelines got pulled down in the first half and you were able to reload them, or do you think there is a sort of environmental factor that may be added to some things you guys might have been able to do a little bit better?\nDan Springer: Kirk, at a personal level, believe me, I\u2019ve spent some time trying to figure out how the external factors have caused this more than my performance. Unfortunately, as we\u2019ve looked at it, I think the core answer to the timing of why now comes back to some of the reasons we talked about earlier -- the reasons we talked about earlier. There was definitely some expectation we would have seen more of this in the first half and it just didn\u2019t happen. And I just think there was momentum coming out of that sort of pandemic-driven demand that lasted a little bit longer than we thought. And if you think about some of the guidance Cynthia gave earlier in the year, we actually outperformed it by more than we did thing. And why it exactly hit more aggressively in Q3, I don\u2019t think we have some sort of precise answer for that. We looked at all the things, like onetime use cases. And as we\u2019ve told you before, we saw that there were some, like PPE loans that were some of those, but that\u2019s not a significant driver of that kind of shift in demand. And we really do believe it\u2019s this core phenomenon of the demand was aggressive and we got focused on meeting that demand. And so, when that demand kind of started to come to -- back to normalized, we weren\u2019t ready. We weren\u2019t executing. We hadn\u2019t taken all those new folks that had only joined in the time of that meet demand sort of mode and we didn\u2019t shift fast enough back to a mode of a normal generating demand. And even with a very large TAM, you still need to sell, right? You still need to go out, meet customer demand, figure out how our use cases will drive their great ROI and then execute against that. And that really is the underpinning. So, I wish I could think of some external things that made Q3 happen. We did have 63% billing growth Q3 last year. So, I would love to sort of try to point to that and say a tough compare. But the real -- the underlying story here is that we did not execute in our field the way you should expect us to execute and we got to own that and we got to fix that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting the focus as we talked about at the beginning of the call on that execution.\nKirk Materne: I appreciate the candor. And Cynthia, maybe just one for you. As you\u2019re going through some of these changes, does anything change in terms of -- I know you\u2019re going to continue to invest for the long term. Does that -- but do you slow that down perhaps a little bit as some of these sales changes kind of harmonized? I guess, does anything change from a sort of investment perspective in the near term, knowing that longer term that you\u2019re still in the early innings of the opportunity? Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, for sure. So, I mean, we\u2019re still investing for long-term growth, and we feel really good about our long-term opportunity, just given how big the market is, our position and brand in the market. And we feel like we\u2019re in the early innings. So, we\u2019ll still continue to invest for growth. I would point out though, our margin has been outperforming because the top line outperformance, but also it\u2019s really hard to invest in quarter when you\u2019re seeing that. So, we have some catch-up to do that you\u2019ll continue to see us do as we move forward. The other thing I might just mention is that the shift did happen more quickly than we were anticipating, right? We had been expecting kind of a more gradual step down. And I think, given some of the things that Dan was talking about, it did happen more quickly than we were thinking it would.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: So, I\u2019ll probably stick to the theme of the call and maybe just try to get at the slowdown from a more geographical perspective first. And like were there any regions or geographies or even domestically any areas that may have been impacted more than others? And then, the other question is, given the -- this happened faster than you anticipated, and it sounds like it will take at least a few quarters to kind of fully right the ship, A, are you contemplating any meaningful adjustments to sales leadership or organizational structure and just territory alignment? And then, because it does feel like given the sales cycles for these larger contracts are at least 6 to 9 months, this could be something that impacts you at least until you anniversary Q3 of next year. So, just get a better understanding of the -- how long those elements, I guess.\nDan Springer: Yes. So, I\u2019ll hit each of those two buckets in terms of the structure as well as the verticals and geographies. Yes, similar to some of the other commentary, I think the right way to think about it is, again, the things that were toughest for H2 of this year are going to be the areas that were dramatically strong all last year and H1 of this year. And from a geography standpoint, that\u2019s basically the U.S., right? And from a vertical standpoint, that\u2019s going to be healthcare, life sciences, that\u2019s going to be financial services, banks, insurance companies, et cetera, and a little bit on the technology telecom side. So, that\u2019s -- we just clearly see that in the data. And in terms of our structuring and our team, I think we have the right people at DocuSign to build this business. I don\u2019t think we executed well in coming off the pandemic. I don\u2019t want to try to all use this as an excuse, but we\u2019ve never had anything like this pandemic, in my professional career. I don\u2019t think we knew exactly how to think about it and how to forecast it. We clearly didn\u2019t forecast it as well as we could or should have. But it was not, again, something that I would say to our team, how the heck didn\u2019t you see this coming, how the heck didn\u2019t you see that\u2019s coming in this way and this timing because we just never had anything comparable to it. So, that said, I have a lot of confidence in the team we have because for the last five years, we have built an incredible franchise and pre-pandemic, we were growing at very strong rates and taking that leadership position that we have and furthering it. So, I am highly confident we will go back to that level of execution and that quality of execution with the team. We did talk about the structuring question around getting our overall go-to-market aligned more aggressively and asking Scott to take on that role, which I think is important. We see that we want to put urgency, particularly to your point, at the enterprise, you\u2019ll see those longer cycles. You don\u2019t see that in our SMB or obviously in our web business, so that is something I think we can see faster impact. But, I do think we have the right people and the right mode. We know how to run this business effectively. And we have to think about this. We had a blip, and we have to get back to the strong DocuSign way of executing.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then, maybe just a separate topic. Retention, attrition and renewal rates, can we talk about what did you see there? Was there any companies that may be to the point that you were making, they pre-bought a lot of capacity that they may be no longer need as they return to work, or any dynamics there that we should kind of take into account from a comparable perspective as we think about the next few quarters?\nDan Springer: Well, customer health is very strong. And to be clear, we don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t have sort of customers leaving DocuSign or anything close to that, right? We have had a continued very strong customer success orientation and therefore, very strong customer success performance, which leads people to stay and want to buy more. However, what we weren\u2019t as successful at is getting as much of the cross-sell and upsell opportunity. And so, from a churn standpoint, we don\u2019t sort of publish kind of churn numbers per se like that. But we have actually seen our performance against the churn be very attractive for the goals. And our goal is actually, over time, even at scale to lower the churn. I would focus you looking at the net retention, the 121% number. Our historical range is 114% to 119%. That obviously elevated with the pandemic, but it\u2019s still performing at above that historic range. And I think we think we\u2019ll be at or near the top of that range for the foreseeable future. So, I think, the customer health is still very, very strong.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. And I would just -- I would clarify, our historic range is 112% to 119%. But Dan is spot on. There were customers kind of digesting what they had purchased. And that certainly played a factor, given the strength we\u2019ve been seeing in the first half of the year. But the health of the business and the health of the customers is strong.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Hey Dan. I think everybody on the call appreciates the contributions that Mike Sheridan made, first as CFO and then heading up International. Do you mind just taking a minute, what were the circumstances under which Mike left DocuSign? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yes, for sure. And I wish Mike were here, we\u2019d do it together. Mike had a fantastic role as our CFO. And I sometimes jokingly have said to folks that when we were a private company and said, gee, Dan, you showed up and you really turned around the profitability of this business. And I sort of jokingly say, yes, Mike Sheridan did that. He got here a year before I did. And by the time I got here, I just got to enjoy the results of what the finance team had done. Mike has been absolutely pivotal to the success of the Company in that role. When we made the decision 1.5-year or so ago that it was an opportunity for us to think about the future and think about the new leadership we wanted to have for our finance organization, and obviously, we brought Cynthia in at that time, we felt that Mike still had a lot of value because of his knowledge of our business and his strength as a business executive. And we had an opportunity where we thought we could do better at sort of driving the strategy of our International growth. And Mike played an important role in helping us think about that. The International teams, right, didn\u2019t report in directly to Mike. Mike led the International strategy and brought fantastic insight to how we could continue to enhance that growth. And I feel good about that contribution he played to some of those numbers we\u2019ve been talking about for growth. But we always knew this wasn\u2019t a full-time sort of operating role, but it was a bit of transition where we\u2019d have him here for a period of time. We didn\u2019t have an exact timing. We just sort of figured, once we felt good that we had the right teams in place, we\u2019ve really strengthened our leadership in both EMEA as well as APAC and brought in the folks that we think as part of our operating teams will lead us to where we want to go. So, that was how we sort of came to the timing. And I think Mike and I have been something we talked about really over a year now, but in the last several months, it came to the conclusion that now was the time when we were ready and as we got ready for the new year going through the planning cycle, we wanted to have those operating people take full responsibility.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham.\nScott Berg: Dan, I wanted to pivot a little bit on the sales side from all the questions, but more towards the channel. I know you had mentioned a couple of different times about taking ownership of some of the execution, and I get a sense that\u2019s more from some of your direct sales. But can you talk about what channel contribution was like in the quarter, and there have been similar changes there as your own direct sales force?\nDan Springer: Yes. The channel side, it\u2019s always tricky because, as you know, there\u2019s sort of the challenge on exactly attributing what portion of each sale occurs to a partner motion in some situations versus direct. And most of ours end up being sort of a hybrid model. We don\u2019t have a channel business per se where we\u2019re not involved and we just sort of license the product and someone else goes and runs that business. We tend to collaborate broadly with most of the great SaaS companies out there. But -- so from that standpoint, it\u2019s a little bit more of an indirect model that way. We talked about some of the partner successes on the call. We are very motivated by the success we see in our Salesforce partnership, one of our strongest partners historically, and we see a ton of opportunity in co-investment there. If you happen to go to Dreamforce, you\u2019d see there were just a few companies that they positioned as key partners and DocuSign was one of them, and we appreciate that support that they give back to us. Microsoft is an area where I think we\u2019re making good progress. We\u2019re getting some of the technical pieces right, as I talked about, particularly around Teams. But Satya and I would both, I think, say we\u2019re disappointed that we haven\u2019t done better in building our joint partnership. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve both been time on and the fact that we\u2019ve got Satya leaning in at all is a testament to the opportunity. And now both sides, we have to do a better job executing there. SAP is another model where we\u2019ve had great success and continue to see impact on serving our joint customers well together. So, that\u2019s probably one that maybe hit some of the highlights. But there are other SaaS companies, the Workdays of the world, the ServiceNow that we see the same kind of opportunity to build those really strong integrations and those strong go-to-market partnerships.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thanks. So, Dan, can I ask sort of two specific ones? The first one is, when you\u2019re talking about customers digesting what they had purchased, that just makes me wonder, did usage actually go down? Do you guys -- you must track that.\nDan Springer: Usage is up. We don\u2019t have any reductions in usage on the platform.\nPat Walravens: Okay. And then, my sort of specific second question is, I\u2019m just reading some of the Glassdoor reviews here, which I know you take really seriously. And so, it seems like Q3 was tough on your sales force. Do you need to adjust quotas or compensation plans given what you guys saw happen in Q3?\nDan Springer: Yes. I don\u2019t know -- at a macro level, I\u2019d say I don\u2019t think so. I really believe the core of the sales execution was us not doing the enablement that Cynthia referred to earlier, so that the new folks in our sales organization understand the traditional DocuSign way of selling, right, where we\u2019re out with our customers and we\u2019re looking for those cross-sell opportunities, we\u2019re identifying the new use cases. And that has created the opportunities for people to be very successful, and we\u2019ve had very high retention relative to other SaaS sales organizations. In this year, I do think that we saw the phenomenon where people got more in the mode of meeting that demand because of the heightened demand. And without finding new sources of value for the customer, we were able to see that growth. And so, I think we probably are going to have some people in our sales organization that are going to say, maybe I\u2019m not able or not interested in learning the new mode, but I think the vast majority of them will say, I joined DocuSign because it\u2019s a great company. And to your Glassdoor point, we have incredibly high Glassdoor ratings. And I think that they\u2019re going to say, I want to be part of this organization. I want to learn and grow to be a more enabled and stronger sales professional. And we think we provide an opportunity for people here to really become fantastic in doing the work of their lives. So, I don\u2019t think the answer is that the quotas were not structured correctly. I think we\u2019ve pretty much had very strong consistency in our quotas really over the last several years. They got a lot easier last year and they went back to normal this year. And -- but if we do our right job on execution around enablement, I think we\u2019ll get back to a very high set of our field sales being successful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: I wanted to ask just one on Notary and Analyzer. I know the broader Agreement Cloud seems to further out, but these solutions seem like they could really help you as you re-pivot back towards that customer success to drive more expansion. Do you feel like you have more in your arsenal of kind of upsell to the customer in the way of product with those two in particular that could perhaps get you back on track with that expand motion?\nDan Springer: Yes. I actually think Notary in particular, I think, is a very significant opportunity to do what you said. I don\u2019t want to lose the point that Cynthia made that again, the amount of Notary, right, it would take to significantly change, to your point, sort of back on track with the overall level of growth. That would be a tall ask right, because it\u2019s starting -- that\u2019s a business, if you think about remote online notary. I mean, it was virtually nonexistent as a space really until about a year or so ago. So, I think, that this is a huge growth opportunity for us. And I think that the activity that we\u2019re seeing in this fourth quarter around Notary is very high. There\u2019s a lot of interest. And I think particularly, going back to the last question -- the last couple of questions around the sales organization, I think we have a sales team now that says, oh, this is exciting. I have new things I need to sell, but it\u2019s also I need to change my motion. And it\u2019s not just about getting an eSignature upsell, but it\u2019s about getting an eSignature upsell, an eSignature cross-sell and a cross-sell opportunity into some of the exciting new products in the Agreement Cloud. So, I do think you\u2019ll see significant success there.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks for that. And one more, if I may. Just it looks like customer count held in real nicely here. So, it didn\u2019t seem like you had really any impact there. What are you seeing with that cohort of new customers that are coming on? Is there any change in kind of where they\u2019re landing and potential for more upsell down the road with some of these newer customers that you signed this quarter?\nDan Springer: Yes, I think it\u2019s early to think about cross-sell to the ones that joined this quarter who were just getting them onboarded. But, a couple of thoughts for you on how to think about that aspect of the business. I think new customer adds were strong. And I think we feel that the core motion of signing up new customers is going to continue to be a strength for us. I think that if you think about the gap I described where we weren\u2019t executing as well as we could on the sort of cross-sell type behavior, if you think about the customers that have come in recently, they have also not been effectively cross-sells, right? So, I think that if you think about the different cohorts, we have an opportunity to significantly enhance our performance by going back to those that have joined in the last year. And usually, it does take a few quarters for them to sort of digest, getting onboarded and the first use cases they bring on board. But then usually when you start getting three, four quarters out, it\u2019s an ideal time for us to go back and say, hey, let\u2019s look at the opportunities to expand. So, I\u2019m really excited that both of these customers coming on in Q3, but more importantly, the ones that come on in the last few quarters, we have a significant opportunity there.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have run out of time for the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Dan Springer for closing remarks.\nDan Springer: Thank you. Hey, as we saw in Q3, there will be fluctuations from time to time in our business. We haven\u2019t had one in our almost four years as a public company that\u2019s been in any way notable. But with the leadership position we have with having over $50 billion TAM that we feel is very addressable, I have never been more confident about DocuSign and optimistic about the big growth opportunity we have ahead. I look forward to the opportunity to chat with you all in the coming months. And thank you very much for your support.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. After six quarters of accelerated demand, we saw customers shift their buying patterns in the third quarter. Revenue, profitability and cash flow remain strong, while billings and dollar net retention came off their highs, especially in light of the tougher year-over-year comparables. As Dan mentioned, we had expected this to happen more gradually, and we saw a more notable shift in Q3 than anticipated. Total revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $545 million, while subscription revenue grew 44% year-over-year to $529 million. Our international business expanded at a healthy rate, especially in our Asia Pacific region this quarter. In total, international revenue grew 68% year-over-year to $128 million, contributing 23% of total revenue. Billings grew 28% year-over-year to $565 million as we were impacted by the shift in customer buying behavior, accentuated by a particularly strong first half of the year. With that said, we brought on 59,000 new customers, bringing our total customer count to 1.11 million customers worldwide, an increase of 35% compared to a year ago. We also added over 11,000 direct customers, bringing the total to nearly 160,000, an increase of 41% year-over-year. Customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grew 45% year-over-year to a total of 785 customers. After an exceptional 1.5 years of customer growth, we continue to add customers at a solid pace. For the sixth quarter in a row, we exceeded the high end of our historical range of dollar net retention, landing at 121% as our existing customers expanded their deployments of our product offerings. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 82% compared with 79% a year ago, while subscription gross margin was 86% compared with 84% a year ago. In Q3, non-GAAP operating margin reached 22% or over $122 million compared with 13% or $49 million in the third quarter of last year. Our Q3 revenue growth continued to outpace our ability to invest at a similar rate in quarter. In addition, the delayed reopening of our offices led to lower-than-expected travel and entertainment expenses. As Dan discussed, we are committed to investing for future growth with a focus on optimizing our go-to-market efforts around demand generation, along with customer success and accelerating our product development and innovation engine. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $121 million compared with $46 million in the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 7,056 employees, an increase of 32% over last year. Operating cash flow came in at $105 million or 19% margin due to continued top line outperformance. This compares with $57 million or 15% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow reached $90 million or 17% margin in the quarter compared to $38 million or 10% in the prior year. We exited Q3 with $908 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Now, let me turn to guidance. Coming off of the strong growth we experienced in the first half of the year, we've done rigorous analysis to understand the current dynamics. As a result, we are maintaining our Q4 subscription revenue guidance and adjusting billings to take into account the risks and opportunities we see in the business. For the fourth quarter and full year fiscal \u201822, guidance is as follows: Total revenue of $557 million to $563 million in Q4 or growth of 29% to 31% year-over-year, and $2.083 billion to $2.089 billion for fiscal \u201822 or growth of 43% to 44% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $544 million to $550 million in Q4 or growth of 33% to 34% year-over-year, and $2.017 billion to $2.023 billion for fiscal \u201822 or growth of 46% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $647 million to $659 million in Q4 or growth of 21% to 23% year-over-year, and $2.335 billion to $2.347 billion for fiscal \u201822 or growth of 36% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q4 and fiscal \u201822. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 17% to 19% for Q4, and 19% to 21% for fiscal \u201822. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income. We expect a tax provision of approximately $3 million to $4 million for fiscal \u201822. We expect fully diluted weighted shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for both, Q4 and fiscal \u201822. In closing, DocuSign has become a critical component of organizations' digital transformations around the globe. While there may be some short-term fluctuations, we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy and steadfast in our commitment to top line growth as our first priority. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Yes. And I would just add to that, echo Dan's comments about investment for growth. We've been talking about the past few quarters that we wouldn't expect to maintain these type of operating margin levels, right? We're kind of at our long-term target margin a lot sooner than we were expecting to be, mainly because of the top line outperformance. So, we'll continue to invest for growth, and we would expect that margin to continue to come down as we do that. The other piece that I would just mention, as Dan said, the investments that we're making are not a step function on the sales and marketing side. But one area that we are very focused on is enablement, right? If you think about the number of people and field folks that we have hired over the course of 18 months, they've really only seen kind of one type of customer demand, and that's kind of urgent demand. So one thing that we will be investing in is making sure we're enabling folks to generate demand in addition to capture the demand that we have. Yes. I think, there's nothing material. I think, the gross margin guide is in line with where we've been performing the last few quarters. And so, we would expect that to continue. Yes. And the one thing I would add to that, as Dan said, eSignature does comprise the vast majority of our revenue, but we also have a really big installed base. And so, one thing that we're really encouraged by is some of the traction we are seeing with CLM and some of the Agreement Cloud products in customers that have had success with eSignature moving to kind of a more strategic dialogue around the broader Agreement Cloud. So, we continue to see positive traction in that area, even though it will show up in the numbers for a while. Yes, for sure. So, I mean, we're still investing for long-term growth, and we feel really good about our long-term opportunity, just given how big the market is, our position and brand in the market. And we feel like we're in the early innings. So, we'll still continue to invest for growth. I would point out though, our margin has been outperforming because the top line outperformance, but also it's really hard to invest in quarter when you're seeing that. So, we have some catch-up to do that you'll continue to see us do as we move forward. The other thing I might just mention is that the shift did happen more quickly than we were anticipating, right? We had been expecting kind of a more gradual step down. And I think, given some of the things that Dan was talking about, it did happen more quickly than we were thinking it would. Yes. And I would just -- I would clarify, our historic range is 112% to 119%. But Dan is spot on. There were customers kind of digesting what they had purchased. And that certainly played a factor, given the strength we've been seeing in the first half of the year. But the health of the business and the health of the customers is strong."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. First, let me share the financial results. In Q3, we continued to see solid performance with our revenue and profitability. Revenue grew 42% year-over-year to $545 million and operating margin reached 22%, exceeding our guidance. International was again a bright spot at 68% year-over-year growth and now 23% of total revenue. However, we fell short of our billings guidance, coming in at 28% year-over-year growth. We expanded our customer base to 1.11 million and we continue to see strong dollar net retention of 121%. The market dynamics that we saw in the third quarter were markedly different from what we experienced in the first half of this year. With the boost from COVID-19 over the past 1.5-year, we experienced exceptionally high growth rates at scale as we captured customer demand at an unprecedented pace. As we moved through Q3 and into the second half of the year, we saw demand slow and the urgency of customers' buying patterns temper. While we had expected an eventual step-down from the peak levels of growth achieved during the height of the pandemic, the environment shifted more quickly than we anticipated, and these were the primary contributors to our billing results in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. Despite this, it's clear that we are still in the early days of the $50 billion Agreement Cloud opportunity as digital transformation remains a high priority for organizations worldwide. DocuSign is uniquely positioned to lead and capture eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud market opportunity, given our strong brand leading market position and product differentiation. Even as the pandemic subsides and people begin to return to the office, they are not returning to paper. eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud are clearly here to stay, and DocuSign's value will persist no matter how the future of work unfolds. To continue to drive growth at scale from new company acquisition to existing customer expansion, we need to ensure our teams are firing on all cylinders. We are doubling down on growth to counter recent trends by aggressively investing in two key strategic areas. First, we are increasing investment in global sales capacity, training and field enablement to speed pipeline generation with new business and to drive expansion within our customer base. We're globalizing our marketing investments across direct and channel sales to drive brand awareness and qualified sales leads, both domestically and in our expanding international markets. As part of this effort, we are aligning our worldwide sales, marketing and success operations under Chief Operating Officer, Scott Olrich. With this move, Chief Revenue Officer, Loren Alhadeff; and SVP of Customer Success, Lambert Walsh, will now report to Scott. In addition, Mike Sheridan, who has served DocuSign for over six years, first as CFO and most recently leading our international strategy, has moved on from the Company as of the end of November. I'd really like to personally thank Mike for all of his many contributions to DocuSign in key roles through critical stages of our development. We all wish Mike well in his retirement. With the substantial growth of these go-to-market organizations in the last 1.5-year, we believe these moves will drive a unified motion towards demand generation, demand capture and our overall growth. The second key strategic area we're investing in is product innovation, which will continue to be an integral part of our success. I'd like to touch on how we are elevating our innovation efforts across our expanded portfolio of products that make up the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. Last month, we enhanced DocuSign Notary, so administrators can manage the availability of first-party notaries, one more reason we believe that DocuSign Notary will become the tool of choice for real estate, insurance and other financial service providers. A number of financial institutions, including Fidelity, added the service in Q3, but M&T Bank is my personal favorite early success story in the space. M&T Bank has been a customer since 2018, but their DocuSign use cases jumped from about 50 to more than 200, first with the introduction of ID verification and now with notary. That's an obvious win for us, but the win for M&T Bank is they can now remotely notarized documents in less than 7 minutes. The combination of eSignature, Identity Verification and Notary are game-changers for M&T's 700 retail branches, and we're hearing that it's making a notable impact on their operating costs as well as a huge plus for their customer experience. Speaking of ID Verification, or IDV for short, last month, we also launched an enhancement that lets customers add SMS reauthentication to IDV envelopes. So after signers pass an initial IDV, they enter a pass code delivered via SMS text to access the envelope, adding an extra layer of security that our customers value, along with added convenience to our customers' customers. We've also made a number of important enhancements to our DocuSign CLM product this quarter, helping organizations automate manual business processes and improve efficiency with every agreement. Just this month, we launched a full set of collaboration tools within the product to give users the ability to comment, tag others and assign tasks all in the CLM UI. On top of those innovations, we continue to make significant enhancements across the entire Agreement Cloud, including new Agreement Actions with Google and Microsoft apps to automate the post-signature tasks; new Delegated Signing capabilities for our enterprise customers; and new tech to simplify invoicing using our popular product, DocuSign Gen for Salesforce Billing. There's plenty more ahead to extend our leadership position and guide our customers into the next generation of agreements as our steady drumbeat of innovation continues to set us apart. We are making significant investments in both product and platform innovation as we believe it drives customer success and positions us well for durable growth going forward. On the customer front, I mentioned earlier that we added 59,000 new customers in Q3, and I'd like to share two of them that are particularly relevant to our focus areas. One of our newest global customers, UPS, adopted an enterprise-wide initiative to modernize their entire contracting process with DocuSign CLM. Having previously used an alternative solution, their 9,000-plus person sales organization is now using CLM and eSignature products in conjunction with Salesforce, all integrated into one workflow. The successful deployment has led to a much faster and more efficient process with greater visibility. This is attracting the attention of other business units where we are actively exploring expansion opportunities. I think it illustrates that both eSignature and CLM can be effective on ramps into enterprise businesses, and both can open the door for deeper cross-departmental adoption rates. Solarity Credit Union in Washington State is a business that prides itself on pushing the boundaries of technology to elevate the customer experience. Solarity first looked at DocuSign to better enable their residential mortgage process with DocuSign Rooms for Mortgage. Next, they began using DocuSign Notary as a standalone offering. Then Solarity became the first DocuSign customer to fully integrate these capabilities to offer a completely digital solution for remote residential mortgage closings. I expect many more stories like Solarity as our customers move to differentiate their own customer experience with seamlessly integrated solutions. We're also continuing to deepen our relationships and drive innovation across our already thriving partner ecosystem. Building on our collaboration of over a decade, we announced an expansion of our global strategic partnership with Salesforce. Together, we expect to build new joint solutions to automate the contract process, improve the customer experience, drive faster ROI and increase collaboration amongst organizations that use Slack, which is now a part of Salesforce. This expansion reflects the fact that Salesforce and DocuSign have consistently succeeded together as partners which, in turn, has generated opportunities to partner in priority areas such as Slack for Salesforce and CLM for DocuSign. Following our eSignature integration with Microsoft Teams earlier this year, DocuSign is now also an official electronic signature provider in the Microsoft Teams' Approvals app, adding to our integration across Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics 365. This latest enhancement allows users to create, manage and share approvals directly from Teams, enabling them to streamline approval requests while keeping up to date on the status of approval. So, to wrap up, we are proactively addressing the rapid change in demand trends that are we seeing as we emerge from the pandemic by investing in the areas most critical to our future growth. Though we've adjusted our near-term outlook to reflect the uncertainties of the current environment, we have strong confidence in our vision and strategy. We are convinced that the growth opportunity for DocuSign remains largely untapped. We have products that are loved by our customers and their customers in turn and technology that is making a difference in the global speed of business as well as the health of our planet. If the last year has shown us anything, it's just how early in the opportunity we really are. In the coming weeks and months, you will see us focus our efforts and investments to drive growth at scale. While disappointed with my execution on billings this quarter, I'm highly optimistic about our long-term growth, and we remain one of the fastest-growing enterprise cloud companies in history. We will continue to innovate across our platform as we lay the foundation for our future expansion across the entire Agreement Cloud. With that, over to you, Cynthia. So, I don't think we're going to be providing guidance for next year, as you would probably expect, Sterling. But, let me talk a little bit about sort of the sources of the change and hopefully, that will be able to give you some perspective on how we think about it. As we talked about in the comments upfront, first half of this year, we actually expected to see more of that impact coming out of the kind of the COVID extra demand we had experienced. And we didn't, right? And so, we ended up outperforming in the first half by probably more than we expected. But in the second half, we saw this now come in much more dramatically in terms of that impact of the removal of that tailwind, if you will. And I think there's sort of two components to it. One, that there is just sort of a change in the buying urgency we've seen from customers. And throughout the COVID era, we had a lot of folks who really needed to get things in place, particularly if they had a large part of their employee base working from home and needed to leverage the benefits of the work-from-anywhere solutions that we have at DocuSign. And then, I think the second component to that is there was sort of a change in the nature of some of that buying. And we had realized that as we were an organization that had started to more fulfill demand from our go-to-market and we were doing less of what we had typically done, which was really generating more demand. And think about that land and expand motion we've talked to you for years about. And I think that was the piece that executionally we did not forecast for because we would never forecast that we would sort of take our eye off the ball there. And I kind of own that aspect of it, where we realized we were not doing all the other motions we've done in the past. And that's, as you see, part of the reason we're restructuring ourselves a little bit to make sure we can get back to the mode that has always been a successful part in driving that growth. So, I think you have to look at those as the kind of core components that describe what has changed. And that's why if you look for the second half, we will have a slower billings rate than we've had traditionally. And I think it's our expectation that in the future, we want to go back to the old mode and really go after creating that demand and working with our customers that we've always done. Yes. So, my view is -- and again, Cynthia can give you some more details on the P&L aspect of it. It's not so much a dramatic shift in the way we're thinking about our investment in sales. I think this is more about the quality of the execution and the coordination as opposed to a dramatic dollar impact. We're going to continue to invest in the -- to achieve that apex of the growth opportunity. But I think we've been doing that historically as well. And we have become much more efficient with that scale. There's a lot in our model that's super attractive. And if anything, as you heard Cynthia described in the comments, we have more profitability in this last quarter even than maybe we would have liked, if that's not an oxymoron to describe. We do want to put more money to work in driving the growth, but I wouldn't think of it as some sort of step function that should dramatically change your view of our P&L over time. Yes. In your question, the sort of proposed answer is present, right? So I think you nailed the phenomenon. Last year, if you thought about the areas where we had just considerable outperformance from what we've expected pre-COVID, it was an industry that had actually been traditional strongholds for DocuSign, but they just accelerated. So, we saw that in financial services, we saw that in healthcare, life sciences, we saw that in some of our technology -- telecom technology areas. So that was by far the biggest drivers last year. And that is where, in Q3, when we started to see that change in demand where we saw the most notable impact in the other direction. So, not surprising, given that if you understand how we explain the phenomenon of that sort of acceleration of demand that occurred over a number of quarters that that would be the place where they would be the biggest reaction in the other direction. Yes. I mean, we are still underpenetrated in every geography and every vertical. When we look at the kind of the construct that we're doing about $2 billion of revenue this year and the bulk of that is still signature-centric. And we think about the TAM as being $25 billion. It's just lightly penetrated. So, I don't think there's any sort of sense of oh, in financial services or health care life sciences, we'd be slowing the push there. I think it's what we need to do is execute effectively, as I described earlier, in those verticals where we already have good footprint, cross-sell opportunities into additional parts of that vertical, like other departments where we haven't yet penetrated them in certain accounts. So, I don't think you should think that we're only going to be aggressively investing in verticals that hadn't been our traditional strongholds. We think there is a lot and a lot of room to grow in the traditional strongholds as well. Yes. I'll talk about the historical first and then we can talk about the future. On the historical side, it's boringly a little bit of the same answer I just gave on the vertical, right? Last year, we really outperformed our expectations more in the United States than even we did, and it was great growth internationally and international took share, but we expected it to take even more share because we had this extra sort of COVID boost that was more dramatic in the U.S. And so, similarly, as we look at Q3 and really into the whole second half of this year, that's the area where we see the hit being the hardest is in North America. And so, I think it's -- again, for the same reasons that the vertical explanation made sense, it's the same reason on geographies. So, that's sort of what's happened. Going forward, again, while we are dramatically more successful and 77% of our revenue this quarter came from our home market, our belief is that we are dramatically underpenetrated still in North America. And so, we will continue to be putting a focus on investment and growth in our overall go-to-market in North America for sure. And it is true, we believe, international because we were slower to get there. And if you think about in the past, we've always talked about it that it's not that it's developing dramatically differently internationally than it is in North America, it's just that we got there later. And that's why it's so at even higher growth rates than we see here in North America. And our expectation is we'll continue to execute well there. And our aspiration is to continue to see our international markets take share in our overall revenue as they did ticking up to 23% this quarter. Yes. I think there are sort of two different things. If you want to think about the three different factors, Stan, that we talked about in terms of the change from first half to second half, we always expected there to be a reduction of that really heightened COVID buying, which drove our growth rates dramatically higher than they had ever been, even as we got bigger. So we expected that. I think the piece that we didn't expect are really the other two factors. So, the one is while we would expect people to sort of return to sort of normalcy in purchasing, we didn't realize that they had been sort of well-stocked with DocuSign, if you will. And we saw some of that purchasing behavior where people were, as you said, in that heightened demand model, probably purchasing more aggressively than we would have seen in the past. And I don't think that was one that was very difficult to sort of understand and calibrate that, and we've seen that in the behavior now. And then, the second piece that gets to the investments you were describing is really around our execution there. And the reason I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to be successful now in a sort of post-COVID or normalized environment, it's because that's the success we had before COVID, right? And I think we -- as I talked about before, I think the gap is, as I think about leading the organization there, as it got easier to sort of meet that demand versus generate that demand with that good work we do where we work with our customers, we understand the use cases where we can expand with them, we help them see those opportunities, and then we help fill against those opportunities. We stopped doing that as people just need more and more volume for their existing use cases, right? And so, I think that's the gap in our execution. And as Cynthia described, a huge portion of our field has joined since pandemic began because we've been growing at such a rate. And we haven't done the job we need to do at enabling them at the traditional DocuSign sort of land and expand processes. So, it is sort of a back to the future mindset for us. And we have to get back to that discipline that we've always had in the past. And that's why I, again, have that high degree of confidence. It's not a new territory for us. It's one we're very familiar with. Yes. Well, so two things. One, it's a little bit of a complexity as you think about those. And we talked about last year that when the focus of our customer base was you just have to help us get sort of the eSignature use cases up quickly, we became very much a fulfilled demand-oriented company. And we took some focus away from some of the broader Agreement Cloud other offerings because our customers were pulling us. I think that was the right course, right? We are a customer success-oriented company, and we needed to focus on that. So, I think now, we see ourselves, having come out of the sort of the COVID period and coming out of the first half where we see that demand changing, you will see us, I would say, reaccelerate and reemphasize our focus on the other Agreement Cloud products. And I think that we're putting a lot of focus on not just the product development, but also the go-to-market there. And I think you're going to continue to see growth and acceleration. We believe the Agreement Cloud products will take share from signature. And I think at this point, because of the scale of the eSignature business relative, and I don't just mean our piece where it's really dramatic, but even in the marketplace, things like CLM or just much smaller developed opportunities today. So, the ability to sort of become meaningful to our financials, it's going to take a while. But that's how I think about our focus and why that's so strategically important to us to build out the overall Agreement Cloud. Kirk, at a personal level, believe me, I've spent some time trying to figure out how the external factors have caused this more than my performance. Unfortunately, as we've looked at it, I think the core answer to the timing of why now comes back to some of the reasons we talked about earlier -- the reasons we talked about earlier. There was definitely some expectation we would have seen more of this in the first half and it just didn't happen. And I just think there was momentum coming out of that sort of pandemic-driven demand that lasted a little bit longer than we thought. And if you think about some of the guidance Cynthia gave earlier in the year, we actually outperformed it by more than we did thing. And why it exactly hit more aggressively in Q3, I don't think we have some sort of precise answer for that. We looked at all the things, like onetime use cases. And as we've told you before, we saw that there were some, like PPE loans that were some of those, but that's not a significant driver of that kind of shift in demand. And we really do believe it's this core phenomenon of the demand was aggressive and we got focused on meeting that demand. And so, when that demand kind of started to come to -- back to normalized, we weren't ready. We weren't executing. We hadn't taken all those new folks that had only joined in the time of that meet demand sort of mode and we didn't shift fast enough back to a mode of a normal generating demand. And even with a very large TAM, you still need to sell, right? You still need to go out, meet customer demand, figure out how our use cases will drive their great ROI and then execute against that. And that really is the underpinning. So, I wish I could think of some external things that made Q3 happen. We did have 63% billing growth Q3 last year. So, I would love to sort of try to point to that and say a tough compare. But the real -- the underlying story here is that we did not execute in our field the way you should expect us to execute and we got to own that and we got to fix that, and that's why we're putting the focus as we talked about at the beginning of the call on that execution. Yes. So, I'll hit each of those two buckets in terms of the structure as well as the verticals and geographies. Yes, similar to some of the other commentary, I think the right way to think about it is, again, the things that were toughest for H2 of this year are going to be the areas that were dramatically strong all last year and H1 of this year. And from a geography standpoint, that's basically the U.S., right? And from a vertical standpoint, that's going to be healthcare, life sciences, that's going to be financial services, banks, insurance companies, et cetera, and a little bit on the technology telecom side. So, that's -- we just clearly see that in the data. And in terms of our structuring and our team, I think we have the right people at DocuSign to build this business. I don't think we executed well in coming off the pandemic. I don't want to try to all use this as an excuse, but we've never had anything like this pandemic, in my professional career. I don't think we knew exactly how to think about it and how to forecast it. We clearly didn't forecast it as well as we could or should have. But it was not, again, something that I would say to our team, how the heck didn't you see this coming, how the heck didn't you see that's coming in this way and this timing because we just never had anything comparable to it. So, that said, I have a lot of confidence in the team we have because for the last five years, we have built an incredible franchise and pre-pandemic, we were growing at very strong rates and taking that leadership position that we have and furthering it. So, I am highly confident we will go back to that level of execution and that quality of execution with the team. We did talk about the structuring question around getting our overall go-to-market aligned more aggressively and asking Scott to take on that role, which I think is important. We see that we want to put urgency, particularly to your point, at the enterprise, you'll see those longer cycles. You don't see that in our SMB or obviously in our web business, so that is something I think we can see faster impact. But, I do think we have the right people and the right mode. We know how to run this business effectively. And we have to think about this. We had a blip, and we have to get back to the strong DocuSign way of executing. Well, customer health is very strong. And to be clear, we don't -- we didn't have sort of customers leaving DocuSign or anything close to that, right? We have had a continued very strong customer success orientation and therefore, very strong customer success performance, which leads people to stay and want to buy more. However, what we weren't as successful at is getting as much of the cross-sell and upsell opportunity. And so, from a churn standpoint, we don't sort of publish kind of churn numbers per se like that. But we have actually seen our performance against the churn be very attractive for the goals. And our goal is actually, over time, even at scale to lower the churn. I would focus you looking at the net retention, the 121% number. Our historical range is 114% to 119%. That obviously elevated with the pandemic, but it's still performing at above that historic range. And I think we think we'll be at or near the top of that range for the foreseeable future. So, I think, the customer health is still very, very strong. Yes, for sure. And I wish Mike were here, we'd do it together. Mike had a fantastic role as our CFO. And I sometimes jokingly have said to folks that when we were a private company and said, gee, Dan, you showed up and you really turned around the profitability of this business. And I sort of jokingly say, yes, Mike Sheridan did that. He got here a year before I did. And by the time I got here, I just got to enjoy the results of what the finance team had done. Mike has been absolutely pivotal to the success of the Company in that role. When we made the decision 1.5-year or so ago that it was an opportunity for us to think about the future and think about the new leadership we wanted to have for our finance organization, and obviously, we brought Cynthia in at that time, we felt that Mike still had a lot of value because of his knowledge of our business and his strength as a business executive. And we had an opportunity where we thought we could do better at sort of driving the strategy of our International growth. And Mike played an important role in helping us think about that. The International teams, right, didn't report in directly to Mike. Mike led the International strategy and brought fantastic insight to how we could continue to enhance that growth. And I feel good about that contribution he played to some of those numbers we've been talking about for growth. But we always knew this wasn't a full-time sort of operating role, but it was a bit of transition where we'd have him here for a period of time. We didn't have an exact timing. We just sort of figured, once we felt good that we had the right teams in place, we've really strengthened our leadership in both EMEA as well as APAC and brought in the folks that we think as part of our operating teams will lead us to where we want to go. So, that was how we sort of came to the timing. And I think Mike and I have been something we talked about really over a year now, but in the last several months, it came to the conclusion that now was the time when we were ready and as we got ready for the new year going through the planning cycle, we wanted to have those operating people take full responsibility. Yes. The channel side, it's always tricky because, as you know, there's sort of the challenge on exactly attributing what portion of each sale occurs to a partner motion in some situations versus direct. And most of ours end up being sort of a hybrid model. We don't have a channel business per se where we're not involved and we just sort of license the product and someone else goes and runs that business. We tend to collaborate broadly with most of the great SaaS companies out there. But -- so from that standpoint, it's a little bit more of an indirect model that way. We talked about some of the partner successes on the call. We are very motivated by the success we see in our Salesforce partnership, one of our strongest partners historically, and we see a ton of opportunity in co-investment there. If you happen to go to Dreamforce, you'd see there were just a few companies that they positioned as key partners and DocuSign was one of them, and we appreciate that support that they give back to us. Microsoft is an area where I think we're making good progress. We're getting some of the technical pieces right, as I talked about, particularly around Teams. But Satya and I would both, I think, say we're disappointed that we haven't done better in building our joint partnership. It's something we've both been time on and the fact that we've got Satya leaning in at all is a testament to the opportunity. And now both sides, we have to do a better job executing there. SAP is another model where we've had great success and continue to see impact on serving our joint customers well together. So, that's probably one that maybe hit some of the highlights. But there are other SaaS companies, the Workdays of the world, the ServiceNow that we see the same kind of opportunity to build those really strong integrations and those strong go-to-market partnerships. Usage is up. We don't have any reductions in usage on the platform. Yes. I don't know -- at a macro level, I'd say I don't think so. I really believe the core of the sales execution was us not doing the enablement that Cynthia referred to earlier, so that the new folks in our sales organization understand the traditional DocuSign way of selling, right, where we're out with our customers and we're looking for those cross-sell opportunities, we're identifying the new use cases. And that has created the opportunities for people to be very successful, and we've had very high retention relative to other SaaS sales organizations. In this year, I do think that we saw the phenomenon where people got more in the mode of meeting that demand because of the heightened demand. And without finding new sources of value for the customer, we were able to see that growth. And so, I think we probably are going to have some people in our sales organization that are going to say, maybe I'm not able or not interested in learning the new mode, but I think the vast majority of them will say, I joined DocuSign because it's a great company. And to your Glassdoor point, we have incredibly high Glassdoor ratings. And I think that they're going to say, I want to be part of this organization. I want to learn and grow to be a more enabled and stronger sales professional. And we think we provide an opportunity for people here to really become fantastic in doing the work of their lives. So, I don't think the answer is that the quotas were not structured correctly. I think we've pretty much had very strong consistency in our quotas really over the last several years. They got a lot easier last year and they went back to normal this year. And -- but if we do our right job on execution around enablement, I think we'll get back to a very high set of our field sales being successful. Yes. I actually think Notary in particular, I think, is a very significant opportunity to do what you said. I don't want to lose the point that Cynthia made that again, the amount of Notary, right, it would take to significantly change, to your point, sort of back on track with the overall level of growth. That would be a tall ask right, because it's starting -- that's a business, if you think about remote online notary. I mean, it was virtually nonexistent as a space really until about a year or so ago. So, I think, that this is a huge growth opportunity for us. And I think that the activity that we're seeing in this fourth quarter around Notary is very high. There's a lot of interest. And I think particularly, going back to the last question -- the last couple of questions around the sales organization, I think we have a sales team now that says, oh, this is exciting. I have new things I need to sell, but it's also I need to change my motion. And it's not just about getting an eSignature upsell, but it's about getting an eSignature upsell, an eSignature cross-sell and a cross-sell opportunity into some of the exciting new products in the Agreement Cloud. So, I do think you'll see significant success there. Yes, I think it's early to think about cross-sell to the ones that joined this quarter who were just getting them onboarded. But, a couple of thoughts for you on how to think about that aspect of the business. I think new customer adds were strong. And I think we feel that the core motion of signing up new customers is going to continue to be a strength for us. I think that if you think about the gap I described where we weren't executing as well as we could on the sort of cross-sell type behavior, if you think about the customers that have come in recently, they have also not been effectively cross-sells, right? So, I think that if you think about the different cohorts, we have an opportunity to significantly enhance our performance by going back to those that have joined in the last year. And usually, it does take a few quarters for them to sort of digest, getting onboarded and the first use cases they bring on board. But then usually when you start getting three, four quarters out, it's an ideal time for us to go back and say, hey, let's look at the opportunities to expand. So, I'm really excited that both of these customers coming on in Q3, but more importantly, the ones that come on in the last few quarters, we have a significant opportunity there. Thank you. Hey, as we saw in Q3, there will be fluctuations from time to time in our business. We haven't had one in our almost four years as a public company that's been in any way notable. But with the leadership position we have with having over $50 billion TAM that we feel is very addressable, I have never been more confident about DocuSign and optimistic about the big growth opportunity we have ahead. I look forward to the opportunity to chat with you all in the coming months. And thank you very much for your support."

Now I would like, to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our second-quarter earnings call for fiscal 2022. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on 3 key areas. Our strong Q2 results, how companies are increasingly digitizing their agreement processes, and how we're cementing DocuSign as a critical pillar of the anywhere economy. Jumping straight into our second-quarter financials, DocuSign's strong performance continued as we delivered a balance of growth and profitability at scale. Revenue grew 50% year-over-year to $512 million, and billings grew 47% year-over-year to $595 million.  Our international business continued its strong growth, up 71% year-over-year. We expanded our customer base beyond the 1 million marks, including the addition of 13,000 new direct customers and some very significant CLM wins with large customers. Finally, we continue to see a strong expansion and upsell motion for eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud suite, driving our dollar net retention of 124%. Overall, I am proud of how our team has continued to stay in front of the evolving COVID business environment. We are helping organizations of all sizes to leverage the power of the Agreement Cloud to digitize the foundation of doing business, the agreement process.  Not only does the customer see DocuSign as a vital part of their response to COVID, but many have also seen a better way of doing business from anywhere. And we believe that will become their new normal. One of our customers, Stacy Johansen, who's the President of Downeast Insurance, told us that when COVID hit and they had to close their physical doors, DocuSign saved them. In other words, and I quote, \"If it weren't for the ability to get an electronic signature, we wouldn't have written half of the new business we did last year.  \" Having succeeded beyond expectations by fully embracing digital tools, Downeast resolved to do business this way from here on. Another example is one of Canada's largest automotive dealers. In response to COVID, the Company adopted DocuSign eSignature and DocuSign Payments to support remote sales and service. The program was so successful, it spawned a larger initiative to offer digital transactions across their entire dealer network. As one Company executive put it, DocuSign has become part of facilitating full breadth of remote experiences. These are just a few examples of what we're seeing again and again. Being able to do business and operate from anywhere is what people now expect.  Plus, it saves time, money, and trees. To cement DocuSign's position as a critical pillar of the anywhere economy, we are executing on 3 core themes as a business. The first is to stay focused on customer success. We're helping our customers and partners to shift their perspective from reactive to proactive, and enacting enterprise-wide programs to automate and digitize their end-to-end agreement processes. Let me highlight just a couple of examples. 1 of our largest U.S. state government customers saw a substantial increase in the thousands of employees accessing their systems remotely.  We were able to scale our eSignature solution to allow the HR and the administration teams to handle the increased load. In addition, the agency rolled out DocuSign CLM to simplify three complex workflows, resulting in 97% of all contracts being completed in significantly less time. And we're not only helping state agencies, today DocuSign serves the majority of the cabinet agencies in the U.S. federal sector. In the private sector, one of the world's largest media and entertainment companies has been a longstanding DocuSign user and has digitized over 400 paper-based workflows with us, growing adoption by 100% year-over-year. Now, the Company has deployed in multiple use cases and has seen a multi-million-dollar return on its investment in the DocuSign Agreement Cloud.  The 2nd theme is giving our customers an agreement cloud platform They can grow into. That means offering the most comprehensive set of applications and integrations available for the agreement process. They can start with eSignature, and then expand into other areas like Contract Lifecycle Management, and into specialized solutions in verticals, like mortgage and life sciences. With every DocuSign Agreement Cloud release, we keep adding to our capabilities and differentiating our platform. Let me note some of our latest highlights. For eSignature, we debut new ID verification capabilities that allow both automatic and manual identity review by senders.  It's now also possible for an identity check to be done once and then remain valid until the envelope is complete, dramatically improving the experience for sender and signer alike. We've improved the embedding and management of our clickwrap solution. And one of our largest retail customers recently completed more than 1 million transactions using DocuSign Click. We introduced a new integration and add-in for Splunk, bringing the security insights provided by DocuSign Monitor into one of the most popular enterprise monitoring tools. We continue to grow the number of notarized transactions completed on our platform.  And today, DocuSign Notary supports remote online notaries in 18 U.S. states, with more coming in the future. Turning to CLM, two key areas stand out for me. The first is our continued build-out of buy-side CLM capabilities. We have released obligation management, which is huge, and a connector for our key partner Ariba. This adds to other buy-side connectors shipped an earlier year. The second CLM highlight is our enhancement of AI-based search and reporting capabilities within the offering, which we call CLM+.  It features automatic contract term extraction and allows for searching of agreements not only by keywords but also by AI-driven concepts such as renewal dates within the next 90 days. to save a huge amount of time and manual effort. And then, there's the trust and security enhancement for the DocuSign platform. We continue to bring enhanced security features to our product suite with solutions like DocuSign Monitor, which I mentioned earlier. We are also deepening our trust and security relationship with our customers. For example, we recently held a number of [Indiscernible] summits. And we're collaborating closely across our customer base in trust and security topics, where there is tremendous demand.  Together, these advancements in our products move us closer to a unified platform of record for agreements and agreement processes. Finally, the third theme is our international business. This remains a highlight for us as our teams outside the US contributed more revenue in Q2 than in any other quarter to date. The key drivers for EMEA, LATAM, and APJ mirror, those that we've seen here in the US. And by way of example, one of Europe's fastest-growing enterprise-focused startups, Celonis, saw a dramatic increase in the volume of contracts that needed to be generated, reviewed, and processed, a workflow that had been largely manual today.  But by implementing DocuSign's CLM, the Company addressed these inefficiencies, saving the legal team countless hours and delivering contracts 80% faster than before. Further expansion is already planned into the procurement and HR teams. And APJ, one of our largest financial services customers, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, expanded its number of use cases and saw a substantial increase in transaction volumes. 1 team saw a 175% increase in the documents process through DocuSign. And another noted a 17-day faster time to revenue. The customers now embarking on an automation project, further integrate and streamline the experience up and downstream.  As these examples indicate, we're pleased with how our international business is accelerating, driven by the same factors, speed, cost efficiency, and user experience that have propelled us domestically. Okay, before I hand it over to Cynthia to walk through the financials, I want to mention another factor, it has always been central to DocuSign, our environmental impact. Our eSignature solution alone has replaced billions of pieces of paper, along with a significant amount of the waste, water, carbon, and wood that are required to make and transport their paper. In addition, to help fight global warming, DocuSign has also committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2022.  As part of this effort, we have launched an ESG portion of our website and have organized a multi-functional team to coordinate our overall sustainability strategy. We will continue to help our customers realize their ESG goals while we work to be a positive example in the running of our own business. I'm incredibly pleased with DocuSign's performance in the Second Quarter, our team has continued to deliver across the board and has done so with a real focus on customer and partner success. I look forward to talking to you in the Q&A shortly. For now, over to Cynthia.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another solid quarter as we outperformed on both the top and bottom lines. We crossed the $0.5 billion marketing revenue for the first time this quarter. And once again, we demonstrated our ability to balance growth and profitability with solid operating results and strong cash flow. Total revenue increased 50% year-over-year to $512 million. Subscription revenue grew 52% year-over-year to $493 million thanks to strong customer demand, early renewals, and [Indiscernible] driven by accelerated consumption from our expanding [Indiscernible] base. Our international business had another outstanding performance with strength across the board led by EMEA.  In total, our international revenue grew 71% year-over-year to almost $114 million, representing a record 22% of total revenue. Billings grew 47% year-over-year to $595 million as we continue to see strong early renewals and expansions of existing customers. Total customers crossed the 1 million marks with more than 65 000 new customers added in the quarter. This brought our total customer count in Q2 to 1,053,000 worldwide, an increase of 41% compared to a year ago. We added 13,000 direct customers, bringing the total to 148,000, an increase of 50% year-over-year. We also saw customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grow 37% year-over-year to a total of 714 customers.  For the 5th quarter in a row, dollar net retention exceeded the high end of our historical range coming in at 124%. The total non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 82% compared with 78% a year ago. While subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 83% a year ago. Our strong revenue growth again, outpaced spending this quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19%, or nearly $100 million compared with 10% or $34 million in the second quarter of last year. Investing for top-line growth remains a high priority for us in the second half of the year, including increasing sales capacity and marketing programs, innovating our products, and scaling our back-office systems and processes.  We see the tight talent market as an opportunity to up-level and develop our people internally while adding complementary skills as we drive the next phase of growth. Non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $98 million compared with $35 million in the second quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 6,551 employees, an increase of 31% over last year. Our client -- our cash flow remained robust in Q2. Operating cash flow came in at $178 million, or a 35% margin, due to continued top-line outperformance. This compares with $118 million or 35% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow reached $162 million or 32% margin in the quarter compared to 100 million or 29% in the prior year. We exited Q2 with $887 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments.  Now let me turn to guidance. Clearly, the last year and a half have been exceptional in nearly every way for DocuSign. In the last 6 quarters, we have scaled our business nearly two-fold, more than doubled our operating profitability, nearly doubled our customer accounts, and reached our highest dollar net retention levels yet. Anyway, you look at it, this is impressive growth at scale. Halfway through fiscal 2022, we have seen customers renewing earlier in the year as they've used more envelopes and their purchases catch up with consumption levels.  While we do not expect to maintain the peak levels of growth seen at the height of the pandemic, our value proposition is strong, regardless of whether people go back to the office, we don't see them going back to pen and paper. Turning to the numbers, for the third quarter and Fiscal year '22, we anticipate total revenue of $526 million to $532 million in Q3, or growth of 37% to 39% year-over-year, and $2.078 billion to $2.088 billion for Fiscal '22, for growth of 43% to 44% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $505 million to $511 million in Q3 or growth of 38% to 39% year-over-year, and $1.995 to $2.005 billion for Fiscal '22 or growth of 44% to 45% year-over-year.  For billings, we expect $585 million to $597 million in Q3 or growth of 33% to 36% year-over-year and $2.409 billion to $2.429 billion for Fiscal '22 or growth of 40% to 41% year-over-year. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q3 and Fiscal '22. We expect the non-GAAP operating margin to be 17% to 19% for Q3 and 16% to 18% for Fiscal '22. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, and we expect a tax provision of approximately $6 million to $9 million for Fiscal '22. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 to 210 million for both Q3 and fiscal '22. In closing, we ended the first half of the year in a strong financial position.  We are focused on investing for future growth, scaling our business, and cementing DocuSign as a critical pillar of the anywhere economy. We would like to thank our customers and especially our DocuSign team for their partnership and hard work in helping us deliver another successful quarter. We look forward to continuing to execute in the second half of the year. Thanks again for joining us today. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. Our first question comes from Bhavani Suri with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nBhavani Suri: Thank you. Can you guys hear me, okay?\nDan Springer: Yeah, hear you fine.\nBhavani Suri: Great. Congrats on the solid quarter, especially that NDR number. That was fantastic. It's rare to see a Company at scale improving, NDR usually trends down, so congrats on that. I have 1 question.  It's really a big, fundamental question. It's not about a quarter or even about a year, but it's not data. And we've talked about this a lot. As you think about the long term, we've talked about how you leverage the mass amounts of contract data you have access to.  You talked about, CO we've talked about remote loading, you've talked about a bunch of things but, I'd love for you to talk about -- again, not a quarter or even 12 months, but 24 or 36, even 3 to 5 years. How are you going to monetize that data? How is that data drive stickiness, but also monetization of the platform? I'd love to just talk through that process. Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yeah, it's a really interesting topic. And when we think a lot about it, let me break it into two pieces; what I think we will do and what I think we won't do. And particularly in that time frame you just described. What we are going to do is leveraging the existing data and the reporting and analytics tools we have, as well as the increasing focus on artificial intelligence to go deeper to leverage that data, to help our customers run their business better.  And I gave an example in the prepared remarks about how folks have been able to learn more about their business and be able to search against their agreements that they've done in the past to understand how they can quickly find information to again, help them to improve the performance of what they do.  We think we have a huge investment opportunity there, which we're going to aggressively invest in. Seal Software was a great example of an acquisition we did to enhance, in this case, our artificial intelligence, engineering skillset. I think you're going to see us doing a lot more in the data science world to make our products more able to help customers run their business better.  2nd thing is, we can mine that information to help us drive more customer success, so we can take a look at how people are using our products, how they're not using our products, which used cases, they're not availing themselves up, when they have incomplete segments of agreements because certain parts of the Company might not be as responsive as others and help them really pinpoint and run their business better and help them figure out ways to grow more with DocuSign because of that.  So that's probably the -- give a couple of flavors I think we're excited about. One of the things a lot of people ask about is, would we be able to figure out a way to leverage all the agreements across our different customers, to offer different kinds of services to people.  We're super-sensitive about that. At this point in time, we are a B2B software Company. Our job is to serve our customers. Taking their data for some other purpose is not on our roadmap in any way.  I agree that there's a lucrative-sounding opportunity there. But at this point, when we talk to our customers, they say we'd like to use our data ourselves, thank you very much, and like you to make the good living you do off helping us be successful with our business, not sort of extract that information to use in another way. I will tell you the one exception to that is when you think about the way we train our models, particularly around things like artificial intelligence.  The fact that we have lots of customers, over a million customers now, we had 13,000 new direct customers alone in this Last Quarter, we're going to get more and more people using our model that is going to allow us to do better learning on those models, which will, of course, be a benefit, of course, across all of our customer set. But for the specific data, we're not going to take our customer's data and use it for other purposes.\nBhavani Suri: I think it's helpful. I mean unless they are the same question but to push you back a little bit. So, I totally agree with you, you don't want to cross data and take someone else's data and share with someone else, especially across, say, competitive customers.  But I guess my question is to help us think through how you monetize them? I concur others have had data for a long time. And they are always talking about benchmarking data and selling benchmarks back to customers whenever they have expenses, whatever we can show you the best bed bug Help us understand how that AI -- it drives stickiness, but monetization I think is interesting in and not, again, today, but over time, how should we think about where DocuSign ends up benefiting, from a revenue and earnings perspective, from that?\nDan Springer: Yeah. Well, I think there are a couple of things. And going off again, at first, what we are going to do, the first bucket I talked about, let me give you a couple of examples of how we have seen that play out.  But -- but to be clear, the bulk of it is not about us monetizing that data for back to those customers, but just allowing them to be more effective and we just have a really strong point of view here that if we drive customer success, and they -- and we increase the quality of the ROI, they get it's only good for our business.  It should drive further adoption of the core business we have. So, our thinking isn't about a new set of service offerings, it's about enhancing what we already do with the Agreement Cloud so people will want to put more with us.  Now, one of the benefits that allow us to expand our footprint very, I think, related to your question is once someone realizes that they should have all of their agreements in our repository and service CLM solution at DocuSign, that means they're going to go out to all the other parts of the Company that haven't yet adopted eSignature as an example and so we really want to consolidate and get all that information into 1 repository.  And we believe that is the way we win with data, by showing people that when they integrate across their Agreement Cloud with DocuSign, that the information we can extract across their agreements and help them across their business understands how to operate it more effectively and more efficiently.  That's where the payout comes to them, and then in turn it comes to us because they grow with us. And that's really the core of how we think about it as opposed to a new set of offerings where we might leverage that data to effectively sell back to them.\nBhavani Suri: I appreciate that. Congrats and thanks to you for the candor, I really appreciate that. Very nice job. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Proceed with your question.\nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I just have one question as well. And it's really regarding one of Cynthia's comments about not having sustainable growth at the peak levels of the pandemic, which no one expects. But this week, in particular, we've seen a number of high-growth companies highlighted by Zoom, starting to show that post-pandemic deceleration.  And my question is how investors should think about the pace of moderation in your growth as we move forward, especially in light of the high growth that you're showing on the international front.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure, thanks for the -- thanks for the question, Sterling. So, I think we've been talking about it the last several quarters. That we wouldn't expect our growth to maintain at the peak levels that we saw a kind of during the height of the pandemic.  Now that's not to say that we still won't have very strong growth and solid growth. We had a very strong first half of the year and we're guiding a strong second half. So, I think one of the beauties of our model is it is a subscription-based model.  And so, these things tend to be gradual. But we did see peak levels of growth at scale during the height of the pandemic, and we would expect that to continue. So, it's very consistent. I don't think there's anything really different in kind of what we're seeing now versus what we were seeing before and saying before in terms of our growth rate.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks, guys, and congratulations on a real nice Quarter. I wanted to ask about the Agreement Cloud. Obviously, you've seen some early traction there. Congratulations on that. I know there's a lot of hard work on the product side and you cited some of the deliverables there.  My question is, where are customers starting here, is it -- is it typically with insights or Analyzer? They're already running eSignature or are this CLM that they typically start with that repository for terms and conditions and then they go into Analyzer? What does the typical path look like for the entry in the Agreement Cloud? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yeah, absolutely. Brad. The first answer is as you implied in your question, but let me make sure I'm absolutely clear about it. The tip of the spear for us is the e-Signature. So, the vast, vast, vast majority of our customers start with Signature and for the simple reason that until you figure out a way to digitize your agreements and capture them in an online fashion. It's really hard to do the remaining aspects of the Agreement Cloud, right?  You don't have a digital agreement. So clearly signatures where people start. What we're seeing is a second move tends to be to CLM and it's the construct of once they start thinking about that repository that you referred to in your question, that's where we really see the opportunity for them to start thinking about a full feature Agreement Cloud that they want to build out across their own system of agreement.  So CLM is where we see the next move and that's where we see ourselves, as you heard me mention in the prepared remarks, where we see a lot of traction right now. And one of the things to keep in mind is last year when we had the surge in eSignature demand that Cynthia was just referring to, at that peak of COVID, we had our customers really pushing us to go signature, signature, signature.  Of course, that was natural for us, because that's what brought us to this dance, right? But we said we had to sort of slow down some of our focus on the other parts of the Agreement Cloud just to meet customer demand, because we are, at our core, a customer success Company, and the DocuSign employees rallied to meet that surge in demand.  Now this year we're starting to see the opportunity to go back to where we were really two years ago and say now let's focus on CLM as that next big opportunity to really expand people into the Agreement Cloud. And we think that will be the foundation for most companies, in how they really build out the rest of the Agreement Cloud beyond signature.\nBrad Sills: That's great Dan and thanks so much and maybe just a follow-up on that. What is the effort involved to go from eSignature to CLM? What does the implementation cycle look like given that this is a repository, there's data resides in here?  Is there an SI partner community that you've developed here to help with that work, or is it more seamless? Maybe it's just not that complicated to go from eSignature to CLM? Thank you so much.\nDan Springer: Well, as you'd guess, we're working hard to make it as seamless as possible. But let me be absolutely clear that the construct of someone becoming an eSignature customer is very different than becoming a CLM customer. And we've done a fantastic job in our core signature product to build an amazingly easy-to-use service.  And one of the things that's indicative of that if you look at the fact that we have over 900,000 customers that have come to us through the web and they never have to talk to anyone at DocuSign if they didn't want to. We're wonderful people to talk to, I hope -- hope you understand, but they don't have to.  They can sign up online, and start using our award-winning software. So, when you get to CLM, you absolutely are going to probably have a statement of work. We'd love it when we get to use one of our SI partners. We do have a fantastic professional services team, but that goal, that organization of train the trainers.  And over time, we really want to see that the SI ecosystem really blossoms to the point that it's a smaller and smaller part of what we do. Now, less than 5% of our revenue services, so it's not like it's something that's become a big part of our business. But we really feel the right way to be as ubiquitous as we can, is to build a strong network there.  And then we believe for the vast majority of customers, they will leverage whether it's our preserve or if they have a really strong IT team internally and they have available resources, which is fairly unusual. If they have that they can do it themselves but the hope for the outcome is it'll be the SI Network, and we're really excited about the progress. We've been building a super-strong ecosystem there, and that's the focus for us in the years to come.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Godin: Hey, guys. This is John Godin on behalf of Scott Berg. I appreciate you taking my question. Are you guys seeing anything different as far as trends go over this past Quarter as far as the mix of growth, and coming from higher consumption levels of existing use cases versus adding additional use cases or moving across the different departments?\nDan Springer: So, in terms of we're doing anything different, we're going to be of course responsive to our customers. And so well, we do have a fantastic customer success organization that's out there suggesting to our customers where their most likely next applications might be and what use cases might make more sense for them.  The answer is again; we respond to the needs of their business from a customer standpoint, I think we're seeing growth across both. We are seeing a lot of people expanding the volumes, I gave some examples in my opening remarks of customers who said, we have a use case, it's working well with DocuSign and we want to do more of that Commonwealth Bank is a good example of that.  But we also have seen fantastic examples of people expanding the number of used cases. Remember our Land and Expand model is really based upon the fact that we get in, we deliver fantastic ROI to one group in the Company for an initial use case that we land with, and then expand across not only more use cases, but also more departments and other divisions within that Company.  And so, I would say from the standpoint there, there's nothing different than I've noticed in the last year and prior years in terms of that mix, I think at the very peak of COVID we probably saw an increase in more use cases that sort of expansion of more things people were doing, over volumes.  So, they just realized there were critical parts of their business they needed to address in the anywhere economy they hadn't done. Today, I think we're probably backed to the normal mix of what's increasing the volumes of existing use cases and what's increasing new use cases.\nJohn Godin: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you, and congrats on the nice numbers. Cynthia, I'd love it if you could talk a little bit about your margin outlook for the second half. Despite raising your total revenue guide by 50 million, you left your operating margin target of 16 to 18 impact and that would require a step-down in the fourth quarter, so maybe you could talk a little bit about what assumptions are driving your second half margin outlook. Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yeah, thank you for the question. So, in terms of margin, we've been performing at the low end of our long-term target margin. And as we said last quarter, we're really looking to make sure we are investing for growth just given the large market opportunity we have and the traction we're seeing in the business.  So, we'll continue to do that, particularly building sales capacity, in our marketing programs and in our product development teams. And we will continue to do that through the back half of the year. Also, remember, as we look into next year, we do look to hire in Q4 and for folks to start in Q4, that will build capacity going into next year and so Q4 tends to have more expense built into it and some of the other Quarter.  So that's driving those assumptions, I'd also just remind you from a margin perspective, some of the top-line outperformance and seen in the first half, certainly shows operating leverage in our business model, right? But we are looking to invest for growth over the long term, and that's what's built into the assumption in the second half in terms of the margin.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. And then maybe a follow-up again for you, Cynthia. You mentioned that you had another quarter of good early renewal and expansions. When you look into the guidance you provided for the second half, what are you -- what are you embedding in terms of a continuation of those early renewal and expansion trends that you saw in Q1 and Q2? Are you expecting that to moderate in the second half?\nCynthia Gaylor: So, what -- the way I would describe it, I think, and we talked about this a lot on last quarter in Q1, we did see a strong early renewal in Q1. I would say that has continued to moderate and was baked into the guidance. As we came into -- Q2 and similar assumptions are baked into the guidance as we moved to the second half of the year.  But we wouldn't expect to have those peak levels that we were talking about last quarter and the quarter before. But we always will have some early renewals, which are a good thing, because it shows customers are using the product and consuming at higher levels.  But we wouldn't expect those peak levels, so our expectation on that is consistent with the guide and it's baked in how we're looking at our consumption trends and then the revenue trends [Indiscernible] of that.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. That's very clear. Thanks, and congrats again.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Was hoping to drill down a little bit on the international front and the success that you're seeing. I think it is about a year ago where you announced a new President of International and obviously, we've seen acceleration over the last year, so, maybe help us understand where you're seeing success and what the second half is going to look like over the next year. Thanks.\nDan Springer: I think we've been pleased across the board with international. I don't think you've put up numbers in the 70s for growth unless you're having pretty good success across the board. I would say our strongest performance in the quarter was in EMEA, which is our largest geography outside of North America.  And -- but it was, again strong across the board APJ, LATAM performed well for us. And I think going forward, it's more of the same, I think we've talked a lot about this construct that we had this focused eight in terms of the core countries where we're operating in and I think we want to continue to focus on those eight and I think over the next year, so you're going to see us expanding on that a little bit.  We may end up getting to a place where it's more like in nine or ten countries where we see that we have sort of a presence, not just online. We sell over to 180 countries if you look at our online business, but we really have dedicated people with feet on the ground.  So, I think that's -- the way I think about it is the core 8 will be big. Europe, I think, is going to continue to be a super exciting opportunity for us. But we are -- we're investing aggressively in branding internationally, and we don't have the same well-known reputation outside of the US as we do have in the US.  And we're putting -- Cynthia referred to the idea of building sales capacity, and a significant portion of that will also go into the international markets. And we are super bullish that we have a big opportunity.  Keep in mind, when you look at that growth, this quarter we hit a record and it's still only 22% of our revenue is coming out of our home country. And so that is a low number for what the opportunity is. So, we have a lot of growth ahead internationally.\nRob Owens: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: As a reminder, we ask participants to limit themselves to 1 question. Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Oh, great. Thank you. Let me add my congratulations. And I'm assuming that reminder was for me. So [Indiscernible]\nPat Walravens: All right. Hey, Dan, we'll stick on international. I think the 8-cores are North America, Australia, UK, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico. And so, the largest economy --\nDan Springer: I just want to say you said North America. I hate to interrupt you, you said North America. U.S. and Canada are friends in the north for their own independent country despite efforts for people like you to make them the 51st state. So yes, as our Canadian colleagues out there, we absolutely consider them a separate and important part of the focus 8. Go ahead with your question.\nPat Walravens: Okay, so I think the largest economies that are not on that list would be China, India, Italy, and the Middle East, Africa. So, I'd love to hear your thoughts on any of those.\nDan Springer: Yes, so I think the answer with China is obviously it\u2019s incredibly complex. I'll knock that one off first. I think the perspective is we see a huge opportunity obviously with the second-largest economy in the world and the largest population, probably for at least another 10 years before India catches up.  But it's also really complex and fraught with a lot of risks as you know well. We do not have a near-term expansion there. I will tell you a lot of our customers are asking us to figure out more options for what we do.  People can sign in China, of course, but to really deal with the complexity of that market is something we need to do, but I would not put that on a very big short-term piece. India is an area where we have done a little bit of work already, and I think we see that as one of the significant opportunities for our future in the next year or two future big investments and growth.  You talked about Italy; we actually have Italy and Spain about the same perspective in terms of in Europe and thinking about the opportunities for larger countries there. We think that's going to be an area over the next year or so where you will see us do more expansion, looking for ways to put feet on the street there.  And I think that can be attractive. The Netherlands is another area that I would add to that. And you know about the rest of North America, but Mexico is a place where we've actually recently started to hire people already. So, we get all 3 of the North American countries into that mix. The Middle East is the last one I believe you mentioned.  We served the Middle East out of our Dublin hub for EMEA. I don't think we have seen as much sort of demand from both the commercial group that sells out of Dublin and the online business, we do to suggest that the Middle East would be as fast as some of those other countries. But I -- but obviously, it's going to be an area that will be a growth area for us, but it would probably come later than the Italy, Spain, Netherlands, countries I mentioned there.\nPat Walravens: Great, thank you.\nDan Springer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Cynthia, I was wondering if you just talk about the net retention rate as we start to lap the peak demand periods from last year. Just talk about how you feel about the ability to stay up at these rates.  And I was also wondering if the rest of the Agreement Cloud, whether it's SIRAM Analytics, is starting to influence that at all? My guess is not yet but I just want you to just comment on that as well. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. Yeah, we were really pleased with the 124% this quarter, coming off the high of 125% last quarter. So, we would expect going into the back half of the year to stay at or above our historical ranges.  And so, nothing's really changed there. The great thing about that metric is, it does demonstrate our dedication to customer success and making customers successful with our products and as they continue to expand their footprint with DocuSign across products.  But I would also agree with your statement that the non - eSignature products are contributing a little bit to that number, but aren't the main driver. It's really -- as Dan said signature is the tip of the spear for us and that includes that metric as well.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the new customer additions. Clearly, that number has remained pretty healthy this year despite the big numbers that you put -- put up last year, I think it was still multiples the pre-pandemic number of customers you're putting up. I guess if you could just help us understand, are the use cases that you're landing these customers a lot different than what you saw last year, I guess.  In some ways, investors might ask why would a customer not have signed up for DocuSign last year and are signing up now, are there kind of new regulatory hurdles that they've been able to get over. Just any color you could provide just kind of the impetus for new customer strength now compared to last year. Thank you.\nDan Springer: For sure, I don't think there's any significant difference in the used cases. We're seeing people start out with, particularly by vertical within a vertical, I think it's -- people are starting in the same use cases. To answer the sort of the conundrum which people ask us all the time, of who hasn't started with DocuSign already when you look at those new customer accounts.  Just give you two thoughts to think about it. One is TAM and one is the number of companies. They are obviously highly correlated numbers. But if you think about the signature TAM at 25 billion and growing, and you think about the rest of the Agreement Cloud it's coming close to doubling that TAM.  And you look at the fact that, if you take a look at Cynthia's guidance, we're going to do a little over $2 billion of revenue. And we are by far a dramatic market share leader, a clue with over half the market. The answer is, this is an underpenetrated space.  So, and if you think about the fact that we've got a little over a million customers, we got pretty excited to say we passed a million customers. But I mean, just in the U.S. alone, there are like 25 million businesses.  So, you think about a global number, many multiples of that. So, the reality is, we are lightly penetrated. This is very early innings in the game, and it's true that if you work in financial services like everyone, all of you on this call, you can imagine a Company not using DocuSign.  But there are tons of verticals that are -- just we're not even scratching the surface and we strongly believe that every Company can and should use DocuSign by the time we get to them. And so, the answer is we're going to be adding a lot of new customers every quarter for years to come.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So, Dan, maybe just for you, I want to go back to Sterling's question because I think it's an important one. I think we're all trying to understand the magnitude of deceleration, and if we take a look at the metrics, I just want to hear from you may be a little bit more color about the pipeline, about retention rates, particularly in the SMB category.  And if we look at the guidance, the guidance for billings does look incrementally more conservative than you've had in the past few quarters. So, I just want to understand, is that cautiousness a sign of something that you're seeing in business or how would you qualify it?\nDan Springer: Yeah. Absolutely. I'll let Cynthia talk about the guidance. It's her domain and expertise, but I'll just give you, my view. I think it's a pretty strong guide. If you look at the historical rates, the Company has grown. We feel pretty good about it considering that the last time we were giving guidance before the pandemic; our Company was half the size.  So, we've doubled and we're still looking at what I think is a really strong guide, particularly on revenue, but as well on billings. I'll let Cynthia give you her view on that. In terms of your question about what's happened in the marketplace, I mean, we feel good.  We feel like we're seeing a lot of demand. We're happy with the new customer ads, we're happy with the revenue growth. Again, if you'd ask me a couple of years ago how I'd feel about 5 numbers in front of our growth rate in revenue, I'd feel pretty good.  I don't think there's a perspective we have that the business has some significant slowdown. I do think what Cynthia said and I would reiterate that -- the peak of COVID that was a big tailwind for us.  And so, for us to do the work, to try to create growth that would look like that long run. I think it would be very, very difficult to be able to deliver that. But I do think we're going to continue to have strong growth rates.  I'll let Cynthia talk specifically to the guide, but from a standpoint of in the marketplace, we're not seeing any differences in churn rates in any meaningful way, we're not seeing -- customers very rarely leave us. If we don't do the right job of customer success and adoption, we might have people where we had some dollar churn.  But if you look at the 124% on the net retention, whatever gaps are having there were more than making up with, dramatically so, with the upsell and the growth. So, I think our success teams are doing a fantastic job at driving fantastic growth in the base. And then again, the new additions, I think they speak for themselves. We're continuing to add a large number of new customers each quarter.  So, I would not take the look at these financial results and say that it's indicative of any sort of significant slowing in the business. I think the numbers are strong. So, Cynthia I don't know if you have anything to add on the guidance specifically to Alex's question.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. That was a very comprehensive answer. Maybe just at the edges, I would say on the back half of the year I mean, our guiding philosophy has been consistent since the Company went public and we guide to what we can see.  And as Dan said, we had a very strong first half, and we're raising guidance in the second half off of considerable scale over the last 12 to 18 months. So, we're feeling good about the business and we're feeling good about the growth rates in the guidance. But we do a guide to what we see, not what we. We don't speculate beyond that.\nAlex Zukin: Understood. Thank you, guys. I -- maybe just a quick follow-up. Is it possible to get the RPO metric on the -- so that we can kind of have a gauge of the bookings?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. We'll -- that will be in our queue so that will be publicly available in the queue, but we don't use RPO just given the duration of our contract and the way that's calculated. We don't think that is an indicative number, but it's -- when you see it, it will be quite strong and the growth rate year-on-year on that metrics is also quite strong.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please, proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks. Thanks so much. Really nice to see continued momentum here. Just one question I wanted to ask maybe about what you're seeing in terms of services, because it's -- looking at your guidance, you're expecting a bit of acceleration on the professional service's line in the back half of the year relative to what we've seen in the first half.  Anything, in particular, is it due to just more CLM and that requiring a little bit more services? I know your services mix is going to remain very, very low, it's always been, and I expect it's going to be that way. But you are expecting this little bit of uptick. So maybe walk us through the assumptions embedded in what you're expecting on the professional services line. Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yeah. Just inching to your point. It's not one of the areas we spend a lot of time thinking about because it is such a small portion of our business. But let me tell you this in terms of thinking about services as you think about the comments earlier.  We would love to have less and less of the services that are provided to our customers on our P&L provided by our tea. We are a partner first Company. We want to invest in building out an SI network that does the vast, vast, vast majority of all the services work for our customers.  1 is we think that's what they do, and what we do is build fantastic software. So, we like the idea of that, for the specialization that we have. So, if you do see from time to time, any positive [Indiscernible] in services relative to our overall software, it's probably going to be indicative of what you mentioned.  Which is if our mix moved more to other parts of the Agreement Cloud, like CLM, where there is going to be more services, there's going to be more statements of work required for implementation.  That would be the thing that would drive more services for us. But again, our hope is that over time, we continue to take any of that incremental service opportunity and move that into the SI partner network that we've built. That could create a fantastic opportunity to them to reinvest into the DocuSign Agreement Cloud as a core platform that they want to sell.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turin: Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. Cynthia, going back to the early renewal commentary, is there anything you can provide just remind us how much visibility you have into those underlying dynamics as they're playing through in your customer base?  And does that renewal conversation insert an opportunity at all to just engage more broadly? I'm assuming it does across the Agreement Cloud. And if so, are you changing gearing, have you changed gearing just as part of the investment spend to just help take advantage of that conversation? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. It's a great question and I think when we're thinking about -- through the customers, and the expansion economics if you will, what we've seen is customers sometimes use more than what they've purchased and so we don't charge them overages per se.  But we look forward to an opportunity to reengage with the customer, talk to them about how they're using the products and how they could be using them more. But we do use that as a time to have them renew or expand on what they're doing with us.  And so, it's both on the eSignature side as well as the broader Agreement Cloud. But you characterize it quite well in terms of the dynamics that we're seeing. And as we talked about a couple of quarters ago, we did see through the pandemic high incentive early renewals, and we're not expecting to see those types of peak levels.  But we do you have visibility into customer consumption and how they are using the product, how they're consuming it through the lifecycle of their contracts. So that is something that we track.  But also, sometimes customers will develop new use cases, and we use it as an opportunity to reengage with them on how -- what else we can be doing with them, but also making sure that their contract terms match their consumption levels.\nMichael Turin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Shelby Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShelby Seyrafi: Yes. Thank you very much. Can you elaborate on the increased investments you're going to have in the second half, especially in Q4? And to be clear, are you implicitly guiding for the non-GAAP Operating margin to decline in Q4 from Q3 because of the increased investments?\nCynthia Gaylor: So, I think implicitly, we give a range of guidance on the operating margin, and part of that is dependent on where the revenue comes in, where the top line comes in, and part of it is dependent on the investments that we're making.  And so, I think the takeaway here is we are looking to invest for growth and particularly in our sales and marketing team to help drive top-line growth, and then in our product development areas, as we continue to innovate around the product and maintain our leading position in the market with customers.  I think those are the two main areas. I'd also note, given how the Company has grown at scale, we also have a lot of back-office catch-up that we're doing with systems and processes and things like that. So, we're continuing to make investments in the back-office to make sure we can serve our customers at a scale. So those are the areas in investment.  But as I said, we -- this year, our top-line outperformance has exceeded our ability to [Indiscernible], and so we're looking for that to catch up by the time we get to the end of the year because our intention is to invest for growth versus optimize for maximum operating margin.\nShelby Seyrafi: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.\nDan Springer: Well, thank you much all for joining us. We look forward to seeing you albeit unfortunately virtually, in the next coming months and then talking to you after Q3. Thanks so much for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful evening.",

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another solid quarter as we outperformed on both the top and bottom lines. We crossed the $0.5 billion marketing revenue for the first time this quarter. And once again, we demonstrated our ability to balance growth and profitability with solid operating results and strong cash flow. Total revenue increased 50% year-over-year to $512 million. Subscription revenue grew 52% year-over-year to $493 million thanks to strong customer demand, early renewals, and [Indiscernible] driven by accelerated consumption from our expanding [Indiscernible] base. Our international business had another outstanding performance with strength across the board led by EMEA.  In total, our international revenue grew 71% year-over-year to almost $114 million, representing a record 22% of total revenue. Billings grew 47% year-over-year to $595 million as we continue to see strong early renewals and expansions of existing customers. Total customers crossed the 1 million marks with more than 65 000 new customers added in the quarter. This brought our total customer count in Q2 to 1,053,000 worldwide, an increase of 41% compared to a year ago. We added 13,000 direct customers, bringing the total to 148,000, an increase of 50% year-over-year. We also saw customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grow 37% year-over-year to a total of 714 customers.  For the 5th quarter in a row, dollar net retention exceeded the high end of our historical range coming in at 124%. The total non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 82% compared with 78% a year ago. While subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 83% a year ago. Our strong revenue growth again, outpaced spending this quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19%, or nearly $100 million compared with 10% or $34 million in the second quarter of last year. Investing for top-line growth remains a high priority for us in the second half of the year, including increasing sales capacity and marketing programs, innovating our products, and scaling our back-office systems and processes.  We see the tight talent market as an opportunity to up-level and develop our people internally while adding complementary skills as we drive the next phase of growth. Non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $98 million compared with $35 million in the second quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 6,551 employees, an increase of 31% over last year. Our client -- our cash flow remained robust in Q2. Operating cash flow came in at $178 million, or a 35% margin, due to continued top-line outperformance. This compares with $118 million or 35% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow reached $162 million or 32% margin in the quarter compared to 100 million or 29% in the prior year. We exited Q2 with $887 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments.  Now let me turn to guidance. Clearly, the last year and a half have been exceptional in nearly every way for DocuSign. In the last 6 quarters, we have scaled our business nearly two-fold, more than doubled our operating profitability, nearly doubled our customer accounts, and reached our highest dollar net retention levels yet. Anyway, you look at it, this is impressive growth at scale. Halfway through fiscal 2022, we have seen customers renewing earlier in the year as they've used more envelopes and their purchases catch up with consumption levels.  While we do not expect to maintain the peak levels of growth seen at the height of the pandemic, our value proposition is strong, regardless of whether people go back to the office, we don't see them going back to pen and paper. Turning to the numbers, for the third quarter and Fiscal year '22, we anticipate total revenue of $526 million to $532 million in Q3, or growth of 37% to 39% year-over-year, and $2.078 billion to $2.088 billion for Fiscal '22, for growth of 43% to 44% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $505 million to $511 million in Q3 or growth of 38% to 39% year-over-year, and $1.995 to $2.005 billion for Fiscal '22 or growth of 44% to 45% year-over-year.  For billings, we expect $585 million to $597 million in Q3 or growth of 33% to 36% year-over-year and $2.409 billion to $2.429 billion for Fiscal '22 or growth of 40% to 41% year-over-year. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q3 and Fiscal '22. We expect the non-GAAP operating margin to be 17% to 19% for Q3 and 16% to 18% for Fiscal '22. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, and we expect a tax provision of approximately $6 million to $9 million for Fiscal '22. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 to 210 million for both Q3 and fiscal '22. In closing, we ended the first half of the year in a strong financial position.  We are focused on investing for future growth, scaling our business, and cementing DocuSign as a critical pillar of the anywhere economy. We would like to thank our customers and especially our DocuSign team for their partnership and hard work in helping us deliver another successful quarter. We look forward to continuing to execute in the second half of the year. Thanks again for joining us today. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Sure, thanks for the -- thanks for the question, Sterling. So, I think we've been talking about it the last several quarters. That we wouldn't expect our growth to maintain at the peak levels that we saw a kind of during the height of the pandemic.  Now that's not to say that we still won't have very strong growth and solid growth. We had a very strong first half of the year and we're guiding a strong second half. So, I think one of the beauties of our model is it is a subscription-based model.  And so, these things tend to be gradual. But we did see peak levels of growth at scale during the height of the pandemic, and we would expect that to continue. So, it's very consistent. I don't think there's anything really different in kind of what we're seeing now versus what we were seeing before and saying before in terms of our growth rate. Yeah, thank you for the question. So, in terms of margin, we've been performing at the low end of our long-term target margin. And as we said last quarter, we're really looking to make sure we are investing for growth just given the large market opportunity we have and the traction we're seeing in the business.  So, we'll continue to do that, particularly building sales capacity, in our marketing programs and in our product development teams. And we will continue to do that through the back half of the year. Also, remember, as we look into next year, we do look to hire in Q4 and for folks to start in Q4, that will build capacity going into next year and so Q4 tends to have more expense built into it and some of the other Quarter.  So that's driving those assumptions, I'd also just remind you from a margin perspective, some of the top-line outperformance and seen in the first half, certainly shows operating leverage in our business model, right? But we are looking to invest for growth over the long term, and that's what's built into the assumption in the second half in terms of the margin. So, what -- the way I would describe it, I think, and we talked about this a lot on last quarter in Q1, we did see a strong early renewal in Q1. I would say that has continued to moderate and was baked into the guidance. As we came into -- Q2 and similar assumptions are baked into the guidance as we moved to the second half of the year.  But we wouldn't expect to have those peak levels that we were talking about last quarter and the quarter before. But we always will have some early renewals, which are a good thing, because it shows customers are using the product and consuming at higher levels.  But we wouldn't expect those peak levels, so our expectation on that is consistent with the guide and it's baked in how we're looking at our consumption trends and then the revenue trends [Indiscernible] of that. Thank you. Sure. Yeah, we were really pleased with the 124% this quarter, coming off the high of 125% last quarter. So, we would expect going into the back half of the year to stay at or above our historical ranges.  And so, nothing's really changed there. The great thing about that metric is, it does demonstrate our dedication to customer success and making customers successful with our products and as they continue to expand their footprint with DocuSign across products.  But I would also agree with your statement that the non - eSignature products are contributing a little bit to that number, but aren't the main driver. It's really -- as Dan said signature is the tip of the spear for us and that includes that metric as well. Sure. That was a very comprehensive answer. Maybe just at the edges, I would say on the back half of the year I mean, our guiding philosophy has been consistent since the Company went public and we guide to what we can see.  And as Dan said, we had a very strong first half, and we're raising guidance in the second half off of considerable scale over the last 12 to 18 months. So, we're feeling good about the business and we're feeling good about the growth rates in the guidance. But we do a guide to what we see, not what we. We don't speculate beyond that. Yes. We'll -- that will be in our queue so that will be publicly available in the queue, but we don't use RPO just given the duration of our contract and the way that's calculated. We don't think that is an indicative number, but it's -- when you see it, it will be quite strong and the growth rate year-on-year on that metrics is also quite strong. Yes.

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our second-quarter earnings call for fiscal 2022. Today, I'd like to focus my comments on 3 key areas. Our strong Q2 results, how companies are increasingly digitizing their agreement processes, and how we're cementing DocuSign as a critical pillar of the anywhere economy. Jumping straight into our second-quarter financials, DocuSign's strong performance continued as we delivered a balance of growth and profitability at scale. Revenue grew 50% year-over-year to $512 million, and billings grew 47% year-over-year to $595 million.  Our international business continued its strong growth, up 71% year-over-year. We expanded our customer base beyond the 1 million marks, including the addition of 13,000 new direct customers and some very significant CLM wins with large customers. Finally, we continue to see a strong expansion and upsell motion for eSignature and the broader Agreement Cloud suite, driving our dollar net retention of 124%. Overall, I am proud of how our team has continued to stay in front of the evolving COVID business environment. We are helping organizations of all sizes to leverage the power of the Agreement Cloud to digitize the foundation of doing business, the agreement process.  Not only does the customer see DocuSign as a vital part of their response to COVID, but many have also seen a better way of doing business from anywhere. And we believe that will become their new normal. One of our customers, Stacy Johansen, who's the President of Downeast Insurance, told us that when COVID hit and they had to close their physical doors, DocuSign saved them. In other words, and I quote, \"If it weren't for the ability to get an electronic signature, we wouldn't have written half of the new business we did last year.  \" Having succeeded beyond expectations by fully embracing digital tools, Downeast resolved to do business this way from here on. Another example is one of Canada's largest automotive dealers. In response to COVID, the Company adopted DocuSign eSignature and DocuSign Payments to support remote sales and service. The program was so successful, it spawned a larger initiative to offer digital transactions across their entire dealer network. As one Company executive put it, DocuSign has become part of facilitating full breadth of remote experiences. These are just a few examples of what we're seeing again and again. Being able to do business and operate from anywhere is what people now expect.  Plus, it saves time, money, and trees. To cement DocuSign's position as a critical pillar of the anywhere economy, we are executing on 3 core themes as a business. The first is to stay focused on customer success. We're helping our customers and partners to shift their perspective from reactive to proactive, and enacting enterprise-wide programs to automate and digitize their end-to-end agreement processes. Let me highlight just a couple of examples. 1 of our largest U.S. state government customers saw a substantial increase in the thousands of employees accessing their systems remotely.  We were able to scale our eSignature solution to allow the HR and the administration teams to handle the increased load. In addition, the agency rolled out DocuSign CLM to simplify three complex workflows, resulting in 97% of all contracts being completed in significantly less time. And we're not only helping state agencies, today DocuSign serves the majority of the cabinet agencies in the U.S. federal sector. In the private sector, one of the world's largest media and entertainment companies has been a longstanding DocuSign user and has digitized over 400 paper-based workflows with us, growing adoption by 100% year-over-year. Now, the Company has deployed in multiple use cases and has seen a multi-million-dollar return on its investment in the DocuSign Agreement Cloud.  The 2nd theme is giving our customers an agreement cloud platform They can grow into. That means offering the most comprehensive set of applications and integrations available for the agreement process. They can start with eSignature, and then expand into other areas like Contract Lifecycle Management, and into specialized solutions in verticals, like mortgage and life sciences. With every DocuSign Agreement Cloud release, we keep adding to our capabilities and differentiating our platform. Let me note some of our latest highlights. For eSignature, we debut new ID verification capabilities that allow both automatic and manual identity review by senders.  It's now also possible for an identity check to be done once and then remain valid until the envelope is complete, dramatically improving the experience for sender and signer alike. We've improved the embedding and management of our clickwrap solution. And one of our largest retail customers recently completed more than 1 million transactions using DocuSign Click. We introduced a new integration and add-in for Splunk, bringing the security insights provided by DocuSign Monitor into one of the most popular enterprise monitoring tools. We continue to grow the number of notarized transactions completed on our platform.  And today, DocuSign Notary supports remote online notaries in 18 U.S. states, with more coming in the future. Turning to CLM, two key areas stand out for me. The first is our continued build-out of buy-side CLM capabilities. We have released obligation management, which is huge, and a connector for our key partner Ariba. This adds to other buy-side connectors shipped an earlier year. The second CLM highlight is our enhancement of AI-based search and reporting capabilities within the offering, which we call CLM+.  It features automatic contract term extraction and allows for searching of agreements not only by keywords but also by AI-driven concepts such as renewal dates within the next 90 days. to save a huge amount of time and manual effort. And then, there's the trust and security enhancement for the DocuSign platform. We continue to bring enhanced security features to our product suite with solutions like DocuSign Monitor, which I mentioned earlier. We are also deepening our trust and security relationship with our customers. For example, we recently held a number of [Indiscernible] summits. And we're collaborating closely across our customer base in trust and security topics, where there is tremendous demand.  Together, these advancements in our products move us closer to a unified platform of record for agreements and agreement processes. Finally, the third theme is our international business. This remains a highlight for us as our teams outside the US contributed more revenue in Q2 than in any other quarter to date. The key drivers for EMEA, LATAM, and APJ mirror, those that we've seen here in the US. And by way of example, one of Europe's fastest-growing enterprise-focused startups, Celonis, saw a dramatic increase in the volume of contracts that needed to be generated, reviewed, and processed, a workflow that had been largely manual today.  But by implementing DocuSign's CLM, the Company addressed these inefficiencies, saving the legal team countless hours and delivering contracts 80% faster than before. Further expansion is already planned into the procurement and HR teams. And APJ, one of our largest financial services customers, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, expanded its number of use cases and saw a substantial increase in transaction volumes. 1 team saw a 175% increase in the documents process through DocuSign. And another noted a 17-day faster time to revenue. The customers now embarking on an automation project, further integrate and streamline the experience up and downstream.  As these examples indicate, we're pleased with how our international business is accelerating, driven by the same factors, speed, cost efficiency, and user experience that have propelled us domestically. Okay, before I hand it over to Cynthia to walk through the financials, I want to mention another factor, it has always been central to DocuSign, our environmental impact. Our eSignature solution alone has replaced billions of pieces of paper, along with a significant amount of the waste, water, carbon, and wood that are required to make and transport their paper. In addition, to help fight global warming, DocuSign has also committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2022.  As part of this effort, we have launched an ESG portion of our website and have organized a multi-functional team to coordinate our overall sustainability strategy. We will continue to help our customers realize their ESG goals while we work to be a positive example in the running of our own business. I'm incredibly pleased with DocuSign's performance in the Second Quarter, our team has continued to deliver across the board and has done so with a real focus on customer and partner success. I look forward to talking to you in the Q&A shortly. For now, over to Cynthia. Yeah, hear you fine. Yeah, it's a really interesting topic. And when we think a lot about it, let me break it into two pieces; what I think we will do and what I think we won't do. And particularly in that time frame you just described. What we are going to do is leveraging the existing data and the reporting and analytics tools we have, as well as the increasing focus on artificial intelligence to go deeper to leverage that data, to help our customers run their business better.  And I gave an example in the prepared remarks about how folks have been able to learn more about their business and be able to search against their agreements that they've done in the past to understand how they can quickly find information to again, help them to improve the performance of what they do.  We think we have a huge investment opportunity there, which we're going to aggressively invest in. Seal Software was a great example of an acquisition we did to enhance, in this case, our artificial intelligence, engineering skillset. I think you're going to see us doing a lot more in the data science world to make our products more able to help customers run their business better.  2nd thing is, we can mine that information to help us drive more customer success, so we can take a look at how people are using our products, how they're not using our products, which used cases, they're not availing themselves up, when they have incomplete segments of agreements because certain parts of the Company might not be as responsive as others and help them really pinpoint and run their business better and help them figure out ways to grow more with DocuSign because of that.  So that's probably the -- give a couple of flavors I think we're excited about. One of the things a lot of people ask about is, would we be able to figure out a way to leverage all the agreements across our different customers, to offer different kinds of services to people.  We're super-sensitive about that. At this point in time, we are a B2B software Company. Our job is to serve our customers. Taking their data for some other purpose is not on our roadmap in any way.  I agree that there's a lucrative-sounding opportunity there. But at this point, when we talk to our customers, they say we'd like to use our data ourselves, thank you very much, and like you to make the good living you do off helping us be successful with our business, not sort of extract that information to use in another way. I will tell you the one exception to that is when you think about the way we train our models, particularly around things like artificial intelligence.  The fact that we have lots of customers, over a million customers now, we had 13,000 new direct customers alone in this Last Quarter, we're going to get more and more people using our model that is going to allow us to do better learning on those models, which will, of course, be a benefit, of course, across all of our customer set. But for the specific data, we're not going to take our customer's data and use it for other purposes. Yeah. Well, I think there are a couple of things. And going off again, at first, what we are going to do, the first bucket I talked about, let me give you a couple of examples of how we have seen that play out.  But -- but to be clear, the bulk of it is not about us monetizing that data for back to those customers, but just allowing them to be more effective and we just have a really strong point of view here that if we drive customer success, and they -- and we increase the quality of the ROI, they get it's only good for our business.  It should drive further adoption of the core business we have. So, our thinking isn't about a new set of service offerings, it's about enhancing what we already do with the Agreement Cloud so people will want to put more with us.  Now, one of the benefits that allow us to expand our footprint very, I think, related to your question is once someone realizes that they should have all of their agreements in our repository and service CLM solution at DocuSign, that means they're going to go out to all the other parts of the Company that haven't yet adopted eSignature as an example and so we really want to consolidate and get all that information into 1 repository.  And we believe that is the way we win with data, by showing people that when they integrate across their Agreement Cloud with DocuSign, that the information we can extract across their agreements and help them across their business understands how to operate it more effectively and more efficiently.  That's where the payout comes to them, and then in turn it comes to us because they grow with us. And that's really the core of how we think about it as opposed to a new set of offerings where we might leverage that data to effectively sell back to them. Yeah, absolutely. Brad. The first answer is as you implied in your question, but let me make sure I'm absolutely clear about it. The tip of the spear for us is the e-Signature. So, the vast, vast, vast majority of our customers start with Signature and for the simple reason that until you figure out a way to digitize your agreements and capture them in an online fashion. It's really hard to do the remaining aspects of the Agreement Cloud, right?  You don't have a digital agreement. So clearly signatures where people start. What we're seeing is a second move tends to be to CLM and it's the construct of once they start thinking about that repository that you referred to in your question, that's where we really see the opportunity for them to start thinking about a full feature Agreement Cloud that they want to build out across their own system of agreement.  So CLM is where we see the next move and that's where we see ourselves, as you heard me mention in the prepared remarks, where we see a lot of traction right now. And one of the things to keep in mind is last year when we had the surge in eSignature demand that Cynthia was just referring to, at that peak of COVID, we had our customers really pushing us to go signature, signature, signature.  Of course, that was natural for us, because that's what brought us to this dance, right? But we said we had to sort of slow down some of our focus on the other parts of the Agreement Cloud just to meet customer demand, because we are, at our core, a customer success Company, and the DocuSign employees rallied to meet that surge in demand.  Now this year we're starting to see the opportunity to go back to where we were really two years ago and say now let's focus on CLM as that next big opportunity to really expand people into the Agreement Cloud. And we think that will be the foundation for most companies, in how they really build out the rest of the Agreement Cloud beyond signature. Well, as you'd guess, we're working hard to make it as seamless as possible. But let me be absolutely clear that the construct of someone becoming an eSignature customer is very different than becoming a CLM customer. And we've done a fantastic job in our core signature product to build an amazingly easy-to-use service.  And one of the things that's indicative of that if you look at the fact that we have over 900,000 customers that have come to us through the web and they never have to talk to anyone at DocuSign if they didn't want to. We're wonderful people to talk to, I hope -- hope you understand, but they don't have to.  They can sign up online, and start using our award-winning software. So, when you get to CLM, you absolutely are going to probably have a statement of work. We'd love it when we get to use one of our SI partners. We do have a fantastic professional services team, but that goal, that organization of train the trainers.  And over time, we really want to see that the SI ecosystem really blossoms to the point that it's a smaller and smaller part of what we do. Now, less than 5% of our revenue services, so it's not like it's something that's become a big part of our business. But we really feel the right way to be as ubiquitous as we can, is to build a strong network there.  And then we believe for the vast majority of customers, they will leverage whether it's our preserve or if they have a really strong IT team internally and they have available resources, which is fairly unusual. If they have that they can do it themselves but the hope for the outcome is it'll be the SI Network, and we're really excited about the progress. We've been building a super-strong ecosystem there, and that's the focus for us in the years to come. So, in terms of we're doing anything different, we're going to be of course responsive to our customers. And so well, we do have a fantastic customer success organization that's out there suggesting to our customers where their most likely next applications might be and what use cases might make more sense for them.  The answer is again; we respond to the needs of their business from a customer standpoint, I think we're seeing growth across both. We are seeing a lot of people expanding the volumes, I gave some examples in my opening remarks of customers who said, we have a use case, it's working well with DocuSign and we want to do more of that Commonwealth Bank is a good example of that.  But we also have seen fantastic examples of people expanding the number of used cases. Remember our Land and Expand model is really based upon the fact that we get in, we deliver fantastic ROI to one group in the Company for an initial use case that we land with, and then expand across not only more use cases, but also more departments and other divisions within that Company.  And so, I would say from the standpoint there, there's nothing different than I've noticed in the last year and prior years in terms of that mix, I think at the very peak of COVID we probably saw an increase in more use cases that sort of expansion of more things people were doing, over volumes.  So, they just realized there were critical parts of their business they needed to address in the anywhere economy they hadn't done. Today, I think we're probably backed to the normal mix of what's increasing the volumes of existing use cases and what's increasing new use cases. I think we've been pleased across the board with international. I don't think you've put up numbers in the 70s for growth unless you're having pretty good success across the board. I would say our strongest performance in the quarter was in EMEA, which is our largest geography outside of North America.  And -- but it was, again strong across the board APJ, LATAM performed well for us. And I think going forward, it's more of the same, I think we've talked a lot about this construct that we had this focused eight in terms of the core countries where we're operating in and I think we want to continue to focus on those eight and I think over the next year, so you're going to see us expanding on that a little bit.  We may end up getting to a place where it's more like in nine or ten countries where we see that we have sort of a presence, not just online. We sell over to 180 countries if you look at our online business, but we really have dedicated people with feet on the ground.  So, I think that's -- the way I think about it is the core 8 will be big. Europe, I think, is going to continue to be a super exciting opportunity for us. But we are -- we're investing aggressively in branding internationally, and we don't have the same well-known reputation outside of the US as we do have in the US.  And we're putting -- Cynthia referred to the idea of building sales capacity, and a significant portion of that will also go into the international markets. And we are super bullish that we have a big opportunity.  Keep in mind, when you look at that growth, this quarter we hit a record and it's still only 22% of our revenue is coming out of our home country. And so that is a low number for what the opportunity is. So, we have a lot of growth ahead internationally. I just want to say you said North America. I hate to interrupt you, you said North America. U.S. and Canada are friends in the north for their own independent country despite efforts for people like you to make them the 51st state. So yes, as our Canadian colleagues out there, we absolutely consider them a separate and important part of the focus 8. Go ahead with your question. Yes, so I think the answer with China is obviously it's incredibly complex. I'll knock that one off first. I think the perspective is we see a huge opportunity obviously with the second-largest economy in the world and the largest population, probably for at least another 10 years before India catches up.  But it's also really complex and fraught with a lot of risks as you know well. We do not have a near-term expansion there. I will tell you a lot of our customers are asking us to figure out more options for what we do.  People can sign in China, of course, but to really deal with the complexity of that market is something we need to do, but I would not put that on a very big short-term piece. India is an area where we have done a little bit of work already, and I think we see that as one of the significant opportunities for our future in the next year or two future big investments and growth.  You talked about Italy; we actually have Italy and Spain about the same perspective in terms of in Europe and thinking about the opportunities for larger countries there. We think that's going to be an area over the next year or so where you will see us do more expansion, looking for ways to put feet on the street there.  And I think that can be attractive. The Netherlands is another area that I would add to that. And you know about the rest of North America, but Mexico is a place where we've actually recently started to hire people already. So, we get all 3 of the North American countries into that mix. The Middle East is the last one I believe you mentioned.  We served the Middle East out of our Dublin hub for EMEA. I don't think we have seen as much sort of demand from both the commercial group that sells out of Dublin and the online business, we do to suggest that the Middle East would be as fast as some of those other countries. But I -- but obviously, it's going to be an area that will be a growth area for us, but it would probably come later than the Italy, Spain, Netherlands, countries I mentioned there. Thank you. For sure, I don't think there's any significant difference in the used cases. We're seeing people start out with, particularly by vertical within a vertical, I think it's -- people are starting in the same use cases. To answer the sort of the conundrum which people ask us all the time, of who hasn't started with DocuSign already when you look at those new customer accounts.  Just give you two thoughts to think about it. One is TAM and one is the number of companies. They are obviously highly correlated numbers. But if you think about the signature TAM at 25 billion and growing, and you think about the rest of the Agreement Cloud it's coming close to doubling that TAM.  And you look at the fact that, if you take a look at Cynthia's guidance, we're going to do a little over $2 billion of revenue. And we are by far a dramatic market share leader, a clue with over half the market. The answer is, this is an underpenetrated space.  So, and if you think about the fact that we've got a little over a million customers, we got pretty excited to say we passed a million customers. But I mean, just in the U.S. alone, there are like 25 million businesses.  So, you think about a global number, many multiples of that. So, the reality is, we are lightly penetrated. This is very early innings in the game, and it's true that if you work in financial services like everyone, all of you on this call, you can imagine a Company not using DocuSign.  But there are tons of verticals that are -- just we're not even scratching the surface and we strongly believe that every Company can and should use DocuSign by the time we get to them. And so, the answer is we're going to be adding a lot of new customers every quarter for years to come. Yeah. Absolutely. I'll let Cynthia talk about the guidance. It's her domain and expertise, but I'll just give you, my view. I think it's a pretty strong guide. If you look at the historical rates, the Company has grown. We feel pretty good about it considering that the last time we were giving guidance before the pandemic; our Company was half the size.  So, we've doubled and we're still looking at what I think is a really strong guide, particularly on revenue, but as well on billings. I'll let Cynthia give you her view on that. In terms of your question about what's happened in the marketplace, I mean, we feel good.  We feel like we're seeing a lot of demand. We're happy with the new customer ads, we're happy with the revenue growth. Again, if you'd ask me a couple of years ago how I'd feel about 5 numbers in front of our growth rate in revenue, I'd feel pretty good.  I don't think there's a perspective we have that the business has some significant slowdown. I do think what Cynthia said and I would reiterate that -- the peak of COVID that was a big tailwind for us.  And so, for us to do the work, to try to create growth that would look like that long run. I think it would be very, very difficult to be able to deliver that. But I do think we're going to continue to have strong growth rates.  I'll let Cynthia talk specifically to the guide, but from a standpoint of in the marketplace, we're not seeing any differences in churn rates in any meaningful way, we're not seeing -- customers very rarely leave us. If we don't do the right job of customer success and adoption, we might have people where we had some dollar churn.  But if you look at the 124% on the net retention, whatever gaps are having there were more than making up with, dramatically so, with the upsell and the growth. So, I think our success teams are doing a fantastic job at driving fantastic growth in the base. And then again, the new additions, I think they speak for themselves. We're continuing to add a large number of new customers each quarter.  So, I would not take the look at these financial results and say that it's indicative of any sort of significant slowing in the business. I think the numbers are strong. So, Cynthia I don't know if you have anything to add on the guidance specifically to Alex's question. Yeah. Just inching to your point. It's not one of the areas we spend a lot of time thinking about because it is such a small portion of our business. But let me tell you this in terms of thinking about services as you think about the comments earlier.  We would love to have less and less of the services that are provided to our customers on our P&L provided by our tea. We are a partner first Company. We want to invest in building out an SI network that does the vast, vast, vast majority of all the services work for our customers.  1 is we think that's what they do, and what we do is build fantastic software. So, we like the idea of that, for the specialization that we have. So, if you do see from time to time, any positive [Indiscernible] in services relative to our overall software, it's probably going to be indicative of what you mentioned.  Which is if our mix moved more to other parts of the Agreement Cloud, like CLM, where there is going to be more services, there's going to be more statements of work required for implementation.  That would be the thing that would drive more services for us. But again, our hope is that over time, we continue to take any of that incremental service opportunity and move that into the SI partner network that we've built. That could create a fantastic opportunity to them to reinvest into the DocuSign Agreement Cloud as a core platform that they want to sell. Well, thank you much all for joining us. We look forward to seeing you albeit unfortunately virtually, in the next coming months and then talking to you after Q3. Thanks so much for joining us."

Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal 2022. We have a lot to cover today. And I\u2019d like to focus my comments on four key areas: our strong Q1 fiscal year 2022 results; more insight into the breadth of our customer journey; international business landscape and how we see that evolving; finally, the key investments we made in technology and people this quarter. But before we get to the financials, I want to share some observations on our markets overall. Since the start of the pandemic, DocuSign has helped to accelerate access healthcare, government, education, small business lending and many other services around the world. But began as an urgent need has now transformed into a strategic priority, and as a result, DocuSign has become an indispensable part of many organizations\u2019 businesses processes. Put in another way, once businesses usually transform their agreement processes, they simply don\u2019t go back. We believe this trend will only accelerate as anywhere economy continues to emerge. In fact, just a few weeks ago, we were excited to welcome DocuSign\u2019s one millionth customer to the platform. Now this move to digital has manifested itself in a great start to the year for DocuSign. We saw strong performance on all fronts, delivering a balanced growth and profitability at scale. Our revenue grew 58% year-over-year to $416 million for the quarter. International reached a milestone with over $100 million in revenue during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin reached all-time high at 20% as the top line growth outpaced our investments and strong expansion across our existing customer base growth record high dollar net retention of 125%. From any vantage point, these are exceptional results that reflect continued demand engagement we are seeing from our customers across all industries and use cases. I am particularly proud of the DocuSign\u2019s team ability to execute despite the vast majority of our 6,000 strong workforce still working from home. As we said, consistently, eSignature is on-ramp to DocuSign for both companies. This quarter was no exception as we saw new and existing customers adopt and expand at record rates with use cases and envelope volumes increasing significant. Let me give you just a few examples. A large delivery service provider needed to capture, monitor, and report on new benefit structures for its workers. We helped the team leverage eSignature PowerForm and DocuSign Insight Analytics to create an entirely new and streamlined process. This saved the hundreds of hours of manual processing and created accurate and efficient management reporting, and it provided an extensible solution for future growth. One of our restaurant service customers needed a way to streamline and automate their agreement generation and signing processes as their industry began to reopen. We worked with them to improve turnaround time and increase sales productivity. Importantly, this dramatically decreased the time to complete agreement from two weeks now to just three days. And one of our leading grocery production customers with printing over a million pieces of paper a month as part of their manufacturing process, they started using eSignature templates and quickly took more than 100,000 sheets of paper out of circulation, a number that will only grow now that other business units can leverage the technology. This expansion was not just domestic, but international as well. Q1, our business outside the U.S. contributed 21% to total revenue. And it continues to be the biggest future growth driver for us and the largest part of our TAM. Today, this looks much like our North American business several years ago, customers growing and expanding similar way. Take one of our multinational telecom media customers as an example. They were looking for a way to digitally transform their internal and external contracting processes and reduce their environmental impact. Using the DocuSign API, the company now has defined workflows for verification, validation and the automatic archive of the contract. This sense deployed the solution in countries across Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. In response to the pandemic, an international pharmaceutical customer takes a huge increase in new users in a regulated industry where standard, advanced, and qualified eSignatures are required. Our teams work together and the results speak for themselves. Amid a 270% increase in new users, they sent 650% more envelopes and completed them 50% faster. And the time to onboard new users dropped from three weeks. We are also driving a variety of strategic initiatives internationally. In late April, we officially opened our virtual doors in Mexico to increase our ability to service customers in Spanish Speaking LATAM. And we\u2019re excited by the early traction we\u2019re seeing there online. We also are upping our focus on regional product offering enhancement [ph]. DocuSign products are grounded in high availability, reliability, security, data privacy, regulatory compliance, and trust, but we can now take that one step further with products like eWitness in the UK. This product makes it possible to electronically identify witnesses when they are signing an agreement. This is increasingly important in the UK as the country\u2019s Land Registration Authority just began accepting witness electronic signatures for their property transaction. DocuSign executed the first-ever Land Registry deed submitted electronically. And now, we\u2019re enabling a new class of high volume, high value agreements that can only be done on paper. So, looking ahead to the rest of fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we remain committed to our vision for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, both as the key pillar and the software platform, for the anywhere economy. Either of that are some important investments in our product, platform, and company as a whole couple of which I want to highlight for you today. The first is our acquisition of the technology and the team from Clause. The innovative, smart agreement technology idea, Clause has been a close partner of ours and has built a platform enables the Clause\u2019s agreement to run as computer code. These mark Clause\u2019s and connect to third-party systems and drive a host of action, like sending notification, running compliance checks, and sending contracts status updates. Their experience developing specific solutions, financial services, insurance, and healthcare companies also compliments the way DocuSign helps many of our customer and how we want to architect the agreement cloud for the future. We\u2019re really excited to welcome Peter, Dan, and the whole team to DocuSign. Second, highlight is our continued expansion of the executive leadership team at DocuSign. As we grow in scale, it\u2019s vital that we optimize our systems, processes and technology infrastructure supports the need of today and the rapidly evolving [indiscernible]. Equally important that we have the right leaders in place to oversee and drive that evolution. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thrilled to welcome Shanthi Iyer, as our new CIO. As the former Chief Data Officer at Cisco, Shanthi will ensure that DocuSign is the world-class in all of those areas and we\u2019re thrilled to have her on board. Also, and we continue our international growth we\u2019re expanding our local and regional leadership bench too. In Q1, we appointed former regional Salesforce, Dan Bognar, to help lead our regional efforts in APJ. Before I hand it over to Cynthia, I want to reiterate that I am optimistic about the year ahead. The value we offer our transformation of the agreement process and everything our team is doing to help our customers and our partner around the world. I look forward to talking with you all during Q&A. And now over to you Cynthia.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. We followed up an exceptional year in fiscal 2021 with an impressive start to fiscal 2022 driven by strong execution. Continued customer demand for our eSignature offerings led to notable top-line growth at scale. We demonstrated significant leverage in our business model with record operating margin and cash flow in the first quarter. Total revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $469 million and subscription revenue grew 61% year-over-year to $452 million. Elevated consumption levels by existing customers continue to drive the trend of early renewals and expansions in the quarter, aided by secular trail winds as customers digitize their businesses. We saw exceptional growth outside of the U.S. with particular strength in EMEA this quarter, as our investments continue to gain traction. In Q1, international revenue crossed the $100 million threshold for the first time. In total, international revenue grew 84% year-over-year to $101 million. Billings also benefited from the strength in customer demand climbing 54% year-over-year to reach $527 million for second quarter above $0.5 billion. Customer growth remained healthy with the addition of more than 96,000 new customers in the quarter. This brings our total installed base to over 988,000 customers worldwide as of the end of Q1, an increase of 50% compared to a year ago. This includes another 11,000 direct customers bringing our total direct customer base to 136,000, an increase of 53% year-over-year. We saw our customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grow 42% year-over-year to a total of 673 customers adding a record 74 customers in Q1. Continued expansions and upsells led to a strong dollar net retention rate of 125% for Q1, highlighting the expansion economics we\u2019ve seen over the past year since the pandemic began. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter with 81% compared with 79% a year ago, while subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. As a result of the outperformance on our top-line, we saw demonstrated operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating margin reached our target model range for the first time at 20% or $93 million compared with 8% or $23 million in the first quarter of last year. We are still in the early innings of a large market opportunity. We plan to continue investing for long-term growth, particularly in sales capacity, marketing, R&D, and the scaling of our operations. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 with $92 million compared with $24 million in the first quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 6,080 employees an increase of 42% over last year. Cash flow also outperformed. Operating cash flow was $136 million or 29% margin due to top-line performance and strong collections. This compares with $59 million or 20% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $123 million or 26% margin in the quarter compared to $33 million or 11% in the prior year. We exited Q1 with $876 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Now, let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter and fiscal year 2022 we anticipate total revenue of $479 million to $485 million in Q2 or growth of 40% to 42% year-over-year, and $2.027 billion to $2.039 billion for fiscal 2022 or growth of 40% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $459 million to $465 million in Q2 or growth of 42% to 44% year-over-year and $1.953 billion to $1.965 billion for fiscal 2022 or growth of 41% to 42% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $549 million to $561 million in Q2 or growth of 35% to 38% year-over-year and $2.338 billion to $2.362 billion for fiscal 2022 or growth 36% to 37% year-over-year.  We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q2 and fiscal 2022. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 16% to 18% for Q2 and fiscal 2022. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest in other income. We also expect a tax provision of approximately $10 to million $12 million for fiscal 2022. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $205 million to $210 million for both Q2 and fiscal 2022. In closing, we are incredibly pleased with our Q1 performance. More than ever, we are enabling businesses around the world. As the anywhere economy continues to develop and grow, DocuSign will remain an integral part of our customers\u2019 digital evolution. Thanks for joining us today. We will now open it up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks, guys. So, on the international front, what are some of the takeaways that you learned in your rollout in the U.S. that you\u2019ve been able to apply under Mike\u2019s leadership in Europe that\u2019s helping you accelerate the growth there?\nDan Springer: We talked about the fact that if you go back a few years to when the U.S. businesses the size of the international business, they looked quite a bit alike, Sterling, all sorts of dimensions, scale, the growth rates have been amazingly similar. I think the core things that I would point to is the focus on customer success for sure is the first piece. And we think we\u2019ve really done a good job at helping the quality of our success organization internationally as a foundation really drives adoption. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, when you get adoption right in a SaaS model, it\u2019s really tees up the land and expand model. So, I would say the second piece is just that, the way we\u2019ve talked about we allocated our sales resources between those that are doing NewCo versus those that are selling to our installed base through expansion sales. We followed that same model. And I think those two pieces are really what have driven that tremendous success. Now, if you talk about those numbers into the 80s for the growth, I don\u2019t recall us ever having that in the U.S. So, I guess in some ways, we taught ourselves so well internationally, so that we\u2019ve exceeded, the student has exceeded the master over that analogy goes from that standpoint. But those would be the themes that I would focus on.\nSterling Auty: Yes, exactly. That makes sense. And one quick follow-up, the call broke up on me a little bit during your prepared remarks, Dan. I didn\u2019t hear any update kind of on the rollout of the notary solution. Can you give us just an update there?\nDan Springer: Absolutely, yes. We\u2019re really excited that we\u2019ve been able to rollout member that first-party notary, which is the piece that we\u2019re primarily focused on because our existing customers, large financial institutions, et cetera, that have a notary, sort of embedded in their business and they use their own notaries, that\u2019s the bigger opportunity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going after first. And that\u2019s now released and we\u2019ve had our first transactions occur. And we\u2019re really thrilled to see that. So very early, we just sort of have that availability now for the market. And then the second piece that we\u2019ll be working on over the rest of this year is third-party notary. And that\u2019s the model where someone has an individual, third-party notary comes, or two people that need to notarize a transaction, but neither of them is a large institution that would have their own. So that\u2019s the progress we\u2019re really pleased.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Cynthia, maybe this one for you. I just love to ask you about the billings\u2019 seasonality this fiscal 2022. You did mention early renewals and expansions as a result of elevated consumption, which at first blush sounds a little bit like a pull forward into Q1. But then on the other hand, your 2Q guide is super strong, you raised the full year by way more than the Q1. So, it sounds like you are signaling strength throughout the year. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on seasonality and whether it changed as a result of the Q1 performance.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. Thanks for that question. Yes, so I think on seasonality, we haven\u2019t seen a big shift in seasonality. We did see a stronger than expected Q1 due to the things that you mentioned, mainly around customer consumption and how they are using the products. So, we were really encouraged by both the consumption metrics that we\u2019re looking at, as well as the use cases that customers are using our product for. And so that\u2019s reflected in both the performance for the quarter, but also the forward guide.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay, great. Congrats on these numbers by the way.\nDan Springer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, thanks for that. Dan, one of the fears, I think, people have had historically on DocuSign is that it\u2019s just a COVID stock, you are going to start decelerating as you start seeing these tough comps. But I think some people forget that you are a capacity-based model. And therefore, if you are seeing these cohorts that you added last year grow at or above previous rates, which it seems like you are with the expanding dollar-based net expansion, you\u2019re very well positioned to actually, grow right through this and be even better positioned on the other side. So, just talk through that, what you saw this quarter around the growth rate of those cohorts and kind of how you\u2019re positioned going forward?\nDan Springer: Yes, Alex, to your point, I don\u2019t know how people are missing it. You write about it in every report I see you make that point, which I appreciate by the way. So hopefully, people will start to listen more to your insight. But I think you nailed it. I think that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing that the phenomenon of that strong customer growth is why you see the net retention rate so high. It\u2019s why you see to the last question from Karl, Cynthia was able to talk about such a strong guide at rates we had not achieved previously for COVID, from a billing standpoint and a revenue standpoint, because we have seen that underlying demand is so strong for the customers. And I really think the key to it is it\u2019s what we talked about at the beginning of the call. So, the phenomenon that people, once they see the benefits of the digital transformation, particularly, around the agreement cloud from having an opportunity to grow their business with us, they don\u2019t go back. In fact, they look for additional opportunities to expand. And so, I don\u2019t think we don\u2019t talk about the Q1 pull forward like it was some fixed amounts of pull forward that pays Peter and takes in Paul. We look at it as it\u2019s just an increasing demand, and it really goes back as you and I have talked about in the past. So, the TAM, we are still in the early days, even of just with eSignature business, our penetration is so low, but it\u2019s a very, very large ocean from which we\u2019re pulling forward that continued strong customer demand. So that\u2019s how we look at it. I think it\u2019s fairly straightforward.\nAlex Zukin: That\u2019s awesome. And then maybe just one, a quick one for Cynthia, dollar-based net expansion ticked up again to 125%. I know in the past you guys have been hesitant to call for a new range or a new normal, but any puts and takes on that figure, how we should think about it? And is any of that starting to be driven by CLM adoption, or is it still mostly the core use case?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So I would say, it\u2019s mainly around the core use case, right? Remember, the agreement cloud we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity there, but it\u2019s still very small from a dollar contribution perspective. So, a lot of that strengthened the net retention number is really around kind of the, what I call retention economics in many ways, right, the expansion economics of the customer base and the cohort of how they are expanding and not just the cohort came over the last 12 months, but the existing cohorts who have continued to expand their usage of the product over time. And then on the first part of that question was around just the range. So, we would expect, as we said last quarter to throughout this year maintain at the high end or above the historical range, which had been 112% to 119% historically. So, we would expect to retain or to maintain high net retention rates kind of going through the year, but we\u2019re not going to be guiding to that metric specifically.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Congrats, guys, on a great run.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious just at a high level as you\u2019re starting to see things get back to normal here in the U.S. and hopefully shortly overseas. What are you seeing just in terms of the evolution of the pipeline? And specifically, do you find that customers are looking at pursuing larger transactions, maybe more strategic transactions now that most of the COVID impacts are behind them. Just curious how you are seeing the pipeline evolves? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s sort of a tale of two products Tyler. If you think about the core signature business versus the rest of the Agreement Cloud, primarily CLM to the first part of that no change. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything fundamentally different. And quite frankly, if you think about during COVID, we didn\u2019t see the nature of the signature transactions different, they just were fast, right. And so, we saw again that acceleration occur. And as Cynthia pointed out, as we\u2019re kind of rounding those quarters and in many ways, I think, starting to move into whatever the new normal will be. We\u2019re still seeing accelerated rate of that customer demand. But I wouldn\u2019t say the size of the transactions are bigger, I think we still land at about the same size. And I think our incremental expansions of the businesses they happen in the same increments, maybe just more of them are occurring across each time here. That\u2019s how I think about it. With CLM, of course, it was dramatically different, right. So, it was some really nice demand was starting to build right before the pandemic. And those, what I would say are more strategic and more substantive transactions. They require usually a statement of work and sort of systems integrator work whether we do the services, is one of our wonderful SI partners. Those are, again by definition, I think a little more complex and the order size density bigger. Those slowed way down, right. People said during the pandemic, we need to focus on really fast ROI. And this is enabling people to deal with working remotely. Now, we see those starting to come back. And so, we see the pipeline starting to build, as we did actually starting in Q4, started more aggressively there. So those are demonstrably coming back. And I think those will be larger deal sizes that we would see. But they don\u2019t cross over between signature at least you need to look at them in two separate sites.\nTyler Radke: Thanks. And just a quick follow-up for Cynthia. So, operating margins were really strong here in the quarter. Obviously, you saw quite a bit of revenue upside, but curious just on the hiring front or any other expense related things, if there was kind of some one-offs driving the strength in just kind of how you are thinking about the pace of hiring throughout the rest of the year? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, the operating margin was pretty phenomenal at 20%. In some ways we would have liked to be able to invest more quickly into that growth and bring down that number. It\u2019s just very difficult to do in quarter. So, we\u2019re really looking through the year at ways to continue to invest for growth. And that\u2019s embedded in the guide as well. So, I would say there was nothing in particular one-off other than the outperformance of the top-line, which pretty immediately drops to operating margin in quarter, but we will look to aggressively invest for the continued growth and the large opportunity ahead of us.\nTyler Radke: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey guys, good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on something that now you guys mentioned a little bit ago, which is just the broader agreement cloud in SpringCM, right. It\u2019s still small numbers and it\u2019s not really material as far as driving the growth maybe even as the net revenue retention that you guys are seeing ticking up nicely. How are you thinking about when that could become big enough and material enough to really drive [indiscernible] this recording now?\nCynthia Gaylor: So, I would say, we\u2019re in the early innings, as Dan was talking about across the Agreement Cloud. And it\u2019s a pretty nascent market, but there\u2019s also just a ton of greenfield opportunities. So, we\u2019re investing heavily both in our go-to-market strategy around that and in customer success, but also just on the product innovation. So, I would expect it to be a few years before it\u2019s really a meaningful contributor. And when you think about kind of the results that we posted the last few quarters, they are primarily driven by eSignature. And just given the scale and the growth rate kind of on the core piece, it\u2019s going to take a while for Agreement Cloud, even if it\u2019s growing quickly within to really have be a meaningful contributor from a top-line perspective.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Got it. And also, I want to follow-up on Alex\u2019s question earlier, which is on net revenue intention. I understand you guys are not \u2013 you\u2019re not really moving out to the range that you normally talk about, but in a similar fashion, what would it take for you to move up that range, is it just yet consistency of seeing this 120-ish plus for x number of quarters? What will we have to think about as the milestone for you to start moving up that range?\nCynthia Gaylor: It\u2019s a metric that we watch very closely, just given the consumption trends. And as we talked about the last few quarters, looking at kind of these new cohorts and how they are consuming and how they are expanding and then existing customers and kind of the more historical cohorts. So, we\u2019re watching that closely. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate guiding to a net retention range, but as I said, we would expect for the remainder of the year for it to remain above the historical range which the top end was 119. Just given the consumption trends we\u2019re seeing, we would expect it to be above that high end of the range. \nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Berg: Hi, everyone congrats on a fantastic quarter. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess I have two. The first one is as you look back over the last year and obviously you\u2019ve seen \u2013 I\u2019ll call it a rush in new business based on pandemic. But has that brought you into any new types of businesses or use cases that is probably, maybe not as well-known? I mean, I think, we all know what e-signature is for, obviously from a generic standpoint, we just didn\u2019t know if you seeing like an activity somewhere new?\nDan Springer: Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything substantial. There are a couple of things that were new, like, you think about the PPP loans, right. There\u2019s a small little cottage industry that got built in supporting the banks. So, by definition, since that didn\u2019t exist before that was new. But that\u2019s really small piece of what we would do. I think you have to think about, just talk about we hit our one millionth customer. We\u2019ve got a lot of customers. We\u2019ve got a lot of industry coverage there. And I actually look at it this way and we sometimes say, we believe that every business eventually should use DocuSign. And that\u2019s the kind of the way we think about the breadth. But I don\u2019t look at sort of particular industries where we\u2019ve not started that journey. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s big areas that you\u2019ve mapped it out to say, we just haven\u2019t been able to find a way to serve them because we do the front office and the back-office use cases. And every company sort of has employees as an internal operation and every company has customers, right. I guess a few Silicon Valley companies have potentially that. But other than that, pretty much everyone has customers. And so, from that standpoint, I think, we really look at it as we are everywhere and we\u2019re going to be everywhere in the anywhere economy. And there hasn\u2019t been a phenomenon that COVID, or anything else with change to sort of open up or introduce new areas. There\u2019s international expansion into new geographies, for sure. But from a vertical standpoint I haven\u2019t seen anything that feels fundamentally just a new thing going forward. \nCynthia Gaylor: And the one thing I would just add to that we have seen again, it\u2019s spot on, there\u2019s not kind of industries and verticals, and that\u2019s one of the strengths of our business is that it\u2019s so diversified across verticals and customer sizes. There hasn\u2019t been some COVID-specific use cases that throughout the year, we\u2019ve also seen translate into other new use cases, whether it\u2019s in verticals or different markets. A good example of that would be PPP loans. Both last year and this year we saw quite a few loans. Some of that we\u2019ll be turning into loan, forgiveness or other FinTech sort of used cases. And so, we have seen some of that, but we\u2019re also seeing consumption into new use cases off the backs of that as an example.\nScott Berg: Got it very helpful. And then I guess from a brief follow-up perspective, your customer metrics and the quarter, obviously was very good and they show a level that\u2019s still elevated versus the pre-pandemic level, even as we anniversary it. But how are sales cycles today compared to a year ago? Obviously, year ago, there was a rush to sign up and use your product, but today are the most recent sales cycles, more normalized what you\u2019re used to seeing, or are you still seeing customers maybe speed through this process a little? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Yes, it\u2019s actually something funny. Before each earnings call Cynthia and I spent time with the team talking about pricing and talking about just sort of the tenor in the market. We do that so that when we get questions like this with people like you, we\u2019re able to give you the latest and greatest. And the pricing has been in a good way, boring as it has been for pretty much every quarter since we went public, but we haven\u2019t seen a lot of change there. In terms of the deal cycle time, we definitely saw some shortened cycle times at the height of the pandemic where there were people who were calling us up, especially on the NewCo side. So, people, we didn\u2019t have a previous relationship and they were really in a hurry. So, you go on DocuSign and that definitely reduce some cycle time, as well as some implementation time. I\u2019d say that was probably reverted back to more normal. At this point we don\u2019t have that, that sense of urgency to be deployed might\u2019ve had. I wouldn\u2019t say that was a significant portion of our business to play it out that way. And remember, in any given quarter, the amount of revenue that comes from new companies versus coming from our base NewCo is obviously very small. And we didn\u2019t see that dramatic change in the existing customers because they were relatively quick in the cycle time for new use cases, you don\u2019t have a contracting sort of NSA kind of requirements there. So, I think that there\u2019s something there, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s significant, but it has reverted to what it would have been before from a cycle time.\nScott Berg: Congrats. And thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, Dan, Cynthia, Annie thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the previous question on customer adds. Because I think a lot of us are pleasantly surprised to see customer adds continuing to hit a record, even as we head into a post-pandemic future. But it looks like, especially on the mobile side, you had a really impressive record this quarter. Maybe could you give us a little bit of a sense of what is it that\u2019s driving that, in spite of the fact that a lot of us would assume that urgency has maybe died down since before, is that a function of certain investments you\u2019re making in the self-serve motion and the mobile channels or something else? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up on the large customers.\nDan Springer: Yes, I think you hit it really well. Yes, there was some perhaps unexpected strength as you said on that dimension, we\u2019re obviously pleased by that strength. On the web and mobile side, I think, that there\u2019s two things that we\u2019ve done well, that\u2019s allowed us to grow, and reach this goal that we set several years ago, hitting a million customers and primarily driven by that team. So that\u2019s where the largest number of our customers exists. The first thing is, I think, we\u2019re getting better and better at our online advertising. I think we built that as a key discipline to our long-term success. And I think that\u2019s been a huge part of driving that. Second thing is, we\u2019re continuing to innovate around our overall digital experience and that process by which people come through, they hit do a trial after they\u2019ve put that on an online ad generally the most common way. And we take them through a trial process. They see the quality of our software. We make it easier and easier for them to become a customer, and that digital flow. I think it\u2019s still a ton of work that we can be better at that, but we have made a lot of effort in the last 18 months there. And I think some of that is starting to pay off that has driven that. One last thing I\u2019ll just add important to understand is really shout out for the web and mobile team. We look at their net ad, part of what\u2019s net out of that is people upgrade, become direct customers. So, some of their most successful, actually almost all of their most successful customers we take them. We take them and we put them into our direct business. And so that\u2019s a group that constantly has to replenish and grow and even faster rate to make up from the fact that we have what we call positive churn. We churn them out of web and mobile and churn them into the direct businesses to expand and take on more fulsome use of our platform with more advanced functionality. And so, from that standpoint I do think that that group, glad you pointed it out, has really been far for us.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. And then just going to the 300,000 customer ads again, really impressive to see it hit it a record this quarter as well. Can you give some color on what\u2019s driving that and generally is this existing direct customers that just expand usage of the entire Agreement Cloud or are you actually landing new logos at that level? Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yes. As is the case prior the vast, vast majority of both the 300,000 up are growth customers, as opposed to net new. It\u2019s not that we\u2019ve never had someone start there, but our land and expand model, we\u2019re not really trying to go out and find that, because of our customer success orientation, we really believe the best way to build the long-term value, is to go out and start small, find some great use cases, deliver fantastic customer success, tremendous ROI, and grow the business and doing out, trying to get giant plans that are complex. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the model that really fits for the Agreement Cloud business. So that\u2019s definitely the case. And in terms of the strength there, I mean, I think it\u2019s highly correlated with the other key metrics that Cynthia is walking through. When you see a really high net retention rate, it means that the companies that were 250, a bunch of them grew, and they\u2019re now at 300. So, there\u2019s not any particular surprise there. It\u2019s just a continued land and expand step that is a number that has some volatility. We know it go back and look over the quarters there are times when, because of the puts and takes for any individual accounts and the way they might be adding things. Sometimes someone does a one-time add to the pop-up over 300 and then they do that that one-time time use case they might\u2019ve had, might pop-down below in the next quarter. So, we do think it\u2019s important to look at that over time as opposed to any one quarter. But I think you\u2019re going to see over time while we keep delivering that same fantastic customer success, we will see that number continue to scale for the reasons particularly.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: All right. Thanks very much. And I\u2019ll echo the congrats on the quarter. Dan, I want to circle back on international. Obviously, it\u2019s a huge TAM for you all. Are there any technological or regulatory hurdles that you need to clear in certain markets for the sort of adoption rate to kind of get to where you are say in the U.S. or more markets where you guys are bigger? And then I guess just as you and might think about it, given that this is something that would be sort of a global opportunity, how are you thinking about placing your bets in terms of making investments in certain regions? And are there regions where you think you\u2019re just about to hit sort of a tipping point perhaps faster than others? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense on, is there anything sort of putting a governor under growth and then how are you guys thinking about sort of your bets and your investments in certain places? Thanks.\nDan Springer: Yes, absolutely. So, couple of thoughts for you. The first is, I believe that at the sort of technological level, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we would point to. There are really important differences in legal frameworks. I mean, we talk a lot about the concept of the common law versus the civil law, legal frameworks, but we deal with these pretty much made the investments to enable the civil law countries, which are the mass majority of countries out there. So, we made those investments really several years ago. And I think we feel good about what we\u2019ve done there. There is sort of data residency issue, if you want to consider that sort of a technical component. And it could be a governor to the extent that some geographies, certain institutions that say, we don\u2019t want to let any data leave our national wall so to speak, most of the government clients feel that way, but sometimes you do see that with like large financial institutions or heavily regulated industries. And so sometimes there is complexity there, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working Azure to have in both Canada and Australia sort of leveraging the public cloud and maintaining those testing that. Trying to determine is that really, enable us to grow faster. I think it\u2019s an area we continue to be testing and working on. I wouldn\u2019t say, yes, we found there\u2019s a massive turbocharge there. But I think it is an area for continued investment in growth. That\u2019s the only things I would sort of point to from either a technological or a legal framework. I do think there\u2019s important things like market awareness, and obviously, particularly, because of our strengths in real estate early on DocuSign became more of a household name in the United States. We don\u2019t have that in most of the countries. So that\u2019s a big component. But I think we need to work on. And I think there\u2019s other things that we still have big opportunity for us to sort of get our house in order of the way that we operate in certain other countries. And we feel more local. I think that\u2019s another area that I\u2019d say we sort of invest in. Wouldn\u2019t exactly call it technological, but there\u2019s sort of just a building the business the areas we\u2019re heavily focused on. And in terms of the second half of your question, in terms of the markets, we\u2019ve talked a lot about our focus eight, and those are the original eight countries over the last several years we\u2019ve said are our primary focus areas in Europe, that\u2019s the UK, Ireland, call one that France and Germany, in the Americas, that\u2019s U.S., Canada, and then Brazil, which has been really entirety of our LATAM focus, then Australia, New Zealand we call that one country. And then finally Japan would be the focus eight countries we\u2019re talking about. And I think now you\u2019re going to see us talk about the investment in Mexico and thinking about, really thinking of that as regional, sort of Spanish speaking LATAM, although Mexico itself, we started in a few months later decided to dramatically increase our investment in terms of on the ground, because we\u2019ve seen so much positive response there in Mexico itself. From a European standpoint, I think, we\u2019ve always seen opportunity in Nordics, in Netherlands. We see more in Southern Europe. I think there\u2019s opportunities in each of those geographies there. I don\u2019t know that it will be massive sort of feet on the ground there, but you are going to see us do more in those areas. And then in Asia-Pac overall, we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve got AMZ [ph] in Japan, very small presence in Singapore. And we\u2019re starting to look at Southeast Asia as a really key investment area. In fact, Mike and I were literally this morning talking about that growth investment there and leveraging that small, small toe in the water we have to go after what we think could be a really attractive market opportunity. But that\u2019s across thinking about Philippine, thinking about Thailand, thinking about what are those core countries in Southeast Asia that we think should fit well for DocuSign. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the geographic footprint.\nKirk Materne: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Hey, thanks guys. And congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask about an earlier comment you made Dan around Insight customers and how you feel that those use cases are extensible for future growth. Is that how we should think about the kind of evolution from customers towards the Agreement Cloud, maybe starting with CLM or Insight, get some use cases under their belt there and then graduate, if you will, into the broader Agreement Cloud or what do those cohort of customers say about the propensity to buy more?\nDan Springer: Yes, I mean, the way I look at it is still the tip of the sphere is going to be signature for sure. And part of it is what Cynthia was describing earlier, we didn\u2019t have a much larger business there. And even though it\u2019s still, as she said, very early innings we have such a substantive leadership position. And we just see so much opportunity to continue to land there. That will be our primary entry point, I think, to most companies. Then, as you indicated in your question Brad, we want to really open up the rest of the Agreement Cloud. And I do believe that areas today that we see is that natural extension second step, CLM and the advanced analytics will increasingly be some of one-two punch. One of our goals is to really integrate some of that field technology and that AI technology into our CLM solution. We feel for a lot particularly about mid-market and up customers. That\u2019s going to be a key buying factor, is the idea that you have embedded fantastic analytic capability onto that CLM solution. And we\u2019re seeing with the analytics on top of just Insight, even this fantastic new product we have called DocuSign Monitor, which is really a security product for people to understand what\u2019s happening in their network by looking at how people are signing agreements with that. We\u2019re seeing huge uptake from customers where they just want to understand more about the business, and our whole thesis around the Seal acquisition, the idea that companies can run their business better with a really thoughtful Agreement Cloud. They can be smarter about the way they grow and execute their core operations. So that is definitely how we think about it. And I think the number of use cases for your question continue to accelerate as people see the business value in the ROI from using our advanced analytics, particularly the AI aspect of our business.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Gariup: Hi everyone. This is Jake on for Bhavan. Just thinking out longer term, when we\u2019re thinking about some of the recent additions to the Agreement Cloud, like notary, Seal Software, CLM, I\u2019d love to hear about what could be the longest-term growth drivers, and if there\u2019s anything that surprised you about initial customer adoption over the last several months? And just would love to hear any color on that.\nDan Springer: Well, I\u2019ll give you my thoughts and then Cynthia can dive and give you a different perspective of your own favorites maybe you want to pick. I mean, I think that you got to look at TAM. I mean we we\u2019re planning this for the long-term. And so even though I look at something like notary and I just have a huge amount of enthusiasm for it, I think, it\u2019s in many ways an extension right, of signing type experience. And so, I think, it\u2019s a special and really important opportunity to bring the joy that DocuSign has brought to signature world to extend that to notary. But I think the total TAM there, isn\u2019t going to allow it to be a pillar. The same way that CLM is. I think CLM is going to be emerging software category within the Agreement Cloud that, several years from now, we\u2019re going to look back and say someone would be crazy to have an eSignature solution. Today, if we look at it that way. I think we now will look at CLM and we get to that a few years down the road where people would be crazy not to be thinking about the way they manage their contracts across the business. That\u2019s probably what I would pick as sort of the big winner, if you will, and what will contribute in the most substantial way to our growth over the long-term. Cynthia, if you have any updates different than that?\nCynthia Gaylor: I think that was fairly comprehensive Dan. And I\u2019ll leave it at that on that one.\nJake Gariup: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAaron Kimson: Hi, this is Aaron Kimson on for Pat. Congrats on the quarter. You mentioned that headcount grew 42% year-over-year. At a high level can you discuss what percentage of that was sales and customer success versus other functions? And then how the company is thinking about headcount growth going forward?\nDan Springer: Yes, I mean, I think, the simplest way to look at the distribution as you know headcount is by far are number one costs. So, if you take a look at how it played out in terms of the percentage of our revenue, a percentage of our revenue attributable to each of the buckets, you\u2019ll see that sales and marketing and product engineering were by far the two groups that we\u2019ve traditionally supported. And that will be the same thing in this quarter and then look forward across the year. Those are the core groups that I\u2019d like to see the most headcount growth. And from a philosophy standpoint, I oftentimes talk about this concept of, we kind of have line functions and then we have functions that support this. And the support functions are just as important as the line function, but I really to scale our business need to scale the line function. So, we need to have a lot of fantastic engineers here building great software, because we\u2019re a software company. And so, the number of engineers that we can grow that is a huge, important driver of our future growth. The same thing is true. If you think about our quarter carrying, AEs or our CSMs that are driving customer success, those are the functions that we really want to see the headcount growing. And people like me and Cynthia were overhead and we like ourselves fine, but we don\u2019t need any more of us. One CFO is fine, CEO is fine, and we want to really focus ourselves on getting more leverage in those lines of operations.\nAaron Kimson: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.\nDan Springer: Thank you all for joining us. You saw Annie at the top, she mentioned we\u2019re going to be out in the market a little bit, I guess, virtually hopefully soon we\u2019ll be out physically. But thank you for joining us. And we look forward to talking to you all next quarter. See you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful evening.",

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. We followed up an exceptional year in fiscal 2021 with an impressive start to fiscal 2022 driven by strong execution. Continued customer demand for our eSignature offerings led to notable top-line growth at scale. We demonstrated significant leverage in our business model with record operating margin and cash flow in the first quarter. Total revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $469 million and subscription revenue grew 61% year-over-year to $452 million. Elevated consumption levels by existing customers continue to drive the trend of early renewals and expansions in the quarter, aided by secular trail winds as customers digitize their businesses. We saw exceptional growth outside of the U.S. with particular strength in EMEA this quarter, as our investments continue to gain traction. In Q1, international revenue crossed the $100 million threshold for the first time. In total, international revenue grew 84% year-over-year to $101 million. Billings also benefited from the strength in customer demand climbing 54% year-over-year to reach $527 million for second quarter above $0.5 billion. Customer growth remained healthy with the addition of more than 96,000 new customers in the quarter. This brings our total installed base to over 988,000 customers worldwide as of the end of Q1, an increase of 50% compared to a year ago. This includes another 11,000 direct customers bringing our total direct customer base to 136,000, an increase of 53% year-over-year. We saw our customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grow 42% year-over-year to a total of 673 customers adding a record 74 customers in Q1. Continued expansions and upsells led to a strong dollar net retention rate of 125% for Q1, highlighting the expansion economics we've seen over the past year since the pandemic began. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter with 81% compared with 79% a year ago, while subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. As a result of the outperformance on our top-line, we saw demonstrated operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating margin reached our target model range for the first time at 20% or $93 million compared with 8% or $23 million in the first quarter of last year. We are still in the early innings of a large market opportunity. We plan to continue investing for long-term growth, particularly in sales capacity, marketing, R&D, and the scaling of our operations. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 with $92 million compared with $24 million in the first quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with 6,080 employees an increase of 42% over last year. Cash flow also outperformed. Operating cash flow was $136 million or 29% margin due to top-line performance and strong collections. This compares with $59 million or 20% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $123 million or 26% margin in the quarter compared to $33 million or 11% in the prior year. We exited Q1 with $876 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Now, let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter and fiscal year 2022 we anticipate total revenue of $479 million to $485 million in Q2 or growth of 40% to 42% year-over-year, and $2.027 billion to $2.039 billion for fiscal 2022 or growth of 40% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $459 million to $465 million in Q2 or growth of 42% to 44% year-over-year and $1.953 billion to $1.965 billion for fiscal 2022 or growth of 41% to 42% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $549 million to $561 million in Q2 or growth of 35% to 38% year-over-year and $2.338 billion to $2.362 billion for fiscal 2022 or growth 36% to 37% year-over-year.  We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q2 and fiscal 2022. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 16% to 18% for Q2 and fiscal 2022. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest in other income. We also expect a tax provision of approximately $10 to million $12 million for fiscal 2022. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $205 million to $210 million for both Q2 and fiscal 2022. In closing, we are incredibly pleased with our Q1 performance. More than ever, we are enabling businesses around the world. As the anywhere economy continues to develop and grow, DocuSign will remain an integral part of our customers' digital evolution. Thanks for joining us today. We will now open it up the call for Q&A. Operator? Sure. Thanks for that question. Yes, so I think on seasonality, we haven't seen a big shift in seasonality. We did see a stronger than expected Q1 due to the things that you mentioned, mainly around customer consumption and how they are using the products. So, we were really encouraged by both the consumption metrics that we're looking at, as well as the use cases that customers are using our product for. And so that's reflected in both the performance for the quarter, but also the forward guide. Yes. So I would say, it's mainly around the core use case, right? Remember, the agreement cloud we're very excited about the opportunity there, but it's still very small from a dollar contribution perspective. So, a lot of that strengthened the net retention number is really around kind of the, what I call retention economics in many ways, right, the expansion economics of the customer base and the cohort of how they are expanding and not just the cohort came over the last 12 months, but the existing cohorts who have continued to expand their usage of the product over time. And then on the first part of that question was around just the range. So, we would expect, as we said last quarter to throughout this year maintain at the high end or above the historical range, which had been 112% to 119% historically. So, we would expect to retain or to maintain high net retention rates kind of going through the year, but we're not going to be guiding to that metric specifically. Thank you. Yes, the operating margin was pretty phenomenal at 20%. In some ways we would have liked to be able to invest more quickly into that growth and bring down that number. It's just very difficult to do in quarter. So, we're really looking through the year at ways to continue to invest for growth. And that's embedded in the guide as well. So, I would say there was nothing in particular one-off other than the outperformance of the top-line, which pretty immediately drops to operating margin in quarter, but we will look to aggressively invest for the continued growth and the large opportunity ahead of us. So, I would say, we're in the early innings, as Dan was talking about across the Agreement Cloud. And it's a pretty nascent market, but there's also just a ton of greenfield opportunities. So, we're investing heavily both in our go-to-market strategy around that and in customer success, but also just on the product innovation. So, I would expect it to be a few years before it's really a meaningful contributor. And when you think about kind of the results that we posted the last few quarters, they are primarily driven by eSignature. And just given the scale and the growth rate kind of on the core piece, it's going to take a while for Agreement Cloud, even if it's growing quickly within to really have be a meaningful contributor from a top-line perspective. It's a metric that we watch very closely, just given the consumption trends. And as we talked about the last few quarters, looking at kind of these new cohorts and how they are consuming and how they are expanding and then existing customers and kind of the more historical cohorts. So, we're watching that closely. I wouldn't anticipate guiding to a net retention range, but as I said, we would expect for the remainder of the year for it to remain above the historical range which the top end was 119. Just given the consumption trends we're seeing, we would expect it to be above that high end of the range. And the one thing I would just add to that we have seen again, it's spot on, there's not kind of industries and verticals, and that's one of the strengths of our business is that it's so diversified across verticals and customer sizes. There hasn't been some COVID-specific use cases that throughout the year, we've also seen translate into other new use cases, whether it's in verticals or different markets. A good example of that would be PPP loans. Both last year and this year we saw quite a few loans. Some of that we'll be turning into loan, forgiveness or other FinTech sort of used cases. And so, we have seen some of that, but we're also seeing consumption into new use cases off the backs of that as an example. I think that was fairly comprehensive Dan. And I'll leave it at that on that one."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal 2022. We have a lot to cover today. And I'd like to focus my comments on four key areas: our strong Q1 fiscal year 2022 results; more insight into the breadth of our customer journey; international business landscape and how we see that evolving; finally, the key investments we made in technology and people this quarter. But before we get to the financials, I want to share some observations on our markets overall. Since the start of the pandemic, DocuSign has helped to accelerate access healthcare, government, education, small business lending and many other services around the world. But began as an urgent need has now transformed into a strategic priority, and as a result, DocuSign has become an indispensable part of many organizations' businesses processes. Put in another way, once businesses usually transform their agreement processes, they simply don't go back. We believe this trend will only accelerate as anywhere economy continues to emerge. In fact, just a few weeks ago, we were excited to welcome DocuSign's one millionth customer to the platform. Now this move to digital has manifested itself in a great start to the year for DocuSign. We saw strong performance on all fronts, delivering a balanced growth and profitability at scale. Our revenue grew 58% year-over-year to $416 million for the quarter. International reached a milestone with over $100 million in revenue during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin reached all-time high at 20% as the top line growth outpaced our investments and strong expansion across our existing customer base growth record high dollar net retention of 125%. From any vantage point, these are exceptional results that reflect continued demand engagement we are seeing from our customers across all industries and use cases. I am particularly proud of the DocuSign's team ability to execute despite the vast majority of our 6,000 strong workforce still working from home. As we said, consistently, eSignature is on-ramp to DocuSign for both companies. This quarter was no exception as we saw new and existing customers adopt and expand at record rates with use cases and envelope volumes increasing significant. Let me give you just a few examples. A large delivery service provider needed to capture, monitor, and report on new benefit structures for its workers. We helped the team leverage eSignature PowerForm and DocuSign Insight Analytics to create an entirely new and streamlined process. This saved the hundreds of hours of manual processing and created accurate and efficient management reporting, and it provided an extensible solution for future growth. One of our restaurant service customers needed a way to streamline and automate their agreement generation and signing processes as their industry began to reopen. We worked with them to improve turnaround time and increase sales productivity. Importantly, this dramatically decreased the time to complete agreement from two weeks now to just three days. And one of our leading grocery production customers with printing over a million pieces of paper a month as part of their manufacturing process, they started using eSignature templates and quickly took more than 100,000 sheets of paper out of circulation, a number that will only grow now that other business units can leverage the technology. This expansion was not just domestic, but international as well. Q1, our business outside the U.S. contributed 21% to total revenue. And it continues to be the biggest future growth driver for us and the largest part of our TAM. Today, this looks much like our North American business several years ago, customers growing and expanding similar way. Take one of our multinational telecom media customers as an example. They were looking for a way to digitally transform their internal and external contracting processes and reduce their environmental impact. Using the DocuSign API, the company now has defined workflows for verification, validation and the automatic archive of the contract. This sense deployed the solution in countries across Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. In response to the pandemic, an international pharmaceutical customer takes a huge increase in new users in a regulated industry where standard, advanced, and qualified eSignatures are required. Our teams work together and the results speak for themselves. Amid a 270% increase in new users, they sent 650% more envelopes and completed them 50% faster. And the time to onboard new users dropped from three weeks. We are also driving a variety of strategic initiatives internationally. In late April, we officially opened our virtual doors in Mexico to increase our ability to service customers in Spanish Speaking LATAM. And we're excited by the early traction we're seeing there online. We also are upping our focus on regional product offering enhancement [ph]. DocuSign products are grounded in high availability, reliability, security, data privacy, regulatory compliance, and trust, but we can now take that one step further with products like eWitness in the UK. This product makes it possible to electronically identify witnesses when they are signing an agreement. This is increasingly important in the UK as the country's Land Registration Authority just began accepting witness electronic signatures for their property transaction. DocuSign executed the first-ever Land Registry deed submitted electronically. And now, we're enabling a new class of high volume, high value agreements that can only be done on paper. So, looking ahead to the rest of fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we remain committed to our vision for the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, both as the key pillar and the software platform, for the anywhere economy. Either of that are some important investments in our product, platform, and company as a whole couple of which I want to highlight for you today. The first is our acquisition of the technology and the team from Clause. The innovative, smart agreement technology idea, Clause has been a close partner of ours and has built a platform enables the Clause's agreement to run as computer code. These mark Clause's and connect to third-party systems and drive a host of action, like sending notification, running compliance checks, and sending contracts status updates. Their experience developing specific solutions, financial services, insurance, and healthcare companies also compliments the way DocuSign helps many of our customer and how we want to architect the agreement cloud for the future. We're really excited to welcome Peter, Dan, and the whole team to DocuSign. Second, highlight is our continued expansion of the executive leadership team at DocuSign. As we grow in scale, it's vital that we optimize our systems, processes and technology infrastructure supports the need of today and the rapidly evolving [indiscernible]. Equally important that we have the right leaders in place to oversee and drive that evolution. That's why I'm thrilled to welcome Shanthi Iyer, as our new CIO. As the former Chief Data Officer at Cisco, Shanthi will ensure that DocuSign is the world-class in all of those areas and we're thrilled to have her on board. Also, and we continue our international growth we're expanding our local and regional leadership bench too. In Q1, we appointed former regional Salesforce, Dan Bognar, to help lead our regional efforts in APJ. Before I hand it over to Cynthia, I want to reiterate that I am optimistic about the year ahead. The value we offer our transformation of the agreement process and everything our team is doing to help our customers and our partner around the world. I look forward to talking with you all during Q&A. And now over to you Cynthia. We talked about the fact that if you go back a few years to when the U.S. businesses the size of the international business, they looked quite a bit alike, Sterling, all sorts of dimensions, scale, the growth rates have been amazingly similar. I think the core things that I would point to is the focus on customer success for sure is the first piece. And we think we've really done a good job at helping the quality of our success organization internationally as a foundation really drives adoption. And as we've talked about before, when you get adoption right in a SaaS model, it's really tees up the land and expand model. So, I would say the second piece is just that, the way we've talked about we allocated our sales resources between those that are doing NewCo versus those that are selling to our installed base through expansion sales. We followed that same model. And I think those two pieces are really what have driven that tremendous success. Now, if you talk about those numbers into the 80s for the growth, I don't recall us ever having that in the U.S. So, I guess in some ways, we taught ourselves so well internationally, so that we've exceeded, the student has exceeded the master over that analogy goes from that standpoint. But those would be the themes that I would focus on. Absolutely, yes. We're really excited that we've been able to rollout member that first-party notary, which is the piece that we're primarily focused on because our existing customers, large financial institutions, et cetera, that have a notary, sort of embedded in their business and they use their own notaries, that's the bigger opportunity and that's what we're going after first. And that's now released and we've had our first transactions occur. And we're really thrilled to see that. So very early, we just sort of have that availability now for the market. And then the second piece that we'll be working on over the rest of this year is third-party notary. And that's the model where someone has an individual, third-party notary comes, or two people that need to notarize a transaction, but neither of them is a large institution that would have their own. So that's the progress we're really pleased. Thank you. Yes, Alex, to your point, I don't know how people are missing it. You write about it in every report I see you make that point, which I appreciate by the way. So hopefully, people will start to listen more to your insight. But I think you nailed it. I think that's exactly what we're seeing. We're seeing that the phenomenon of that strong customer growth is why you see the net retention rate so high. It's why you see to the last question from Karl, Cynthia was able to talk about such a strong guide at rates we had not achieved previously for COVID, from a billing standpoint and a revenue standpoint, because we have seen that underlying demand is so strong for the customers. And I really think the key to it is it's what we talked about at the beginning of the call. So, the phenomenon that people, once they see the benefits of the digital transformation, particularly, around the agreement cloud from having an opportunity to grow their business with us, they don't go back. In fact, they look for additional opportunities to expand. And so, I don't think we don't talk about the Q1 pull forward like it was some fixed amounts of pull forward that pays Peter and takes in Paul. We look at it as it's just an increasing demand, and it really goes back as you and I have talked about in the past. So, the TAM, we are still in the early days, even of just with eSignature business, our penetration is so low, but it's a very, very large ocean from which we're pulling forward that continued strong customer demand. So that's how we look at it. I think it's fairly straightforward. Yes, I'd say it's sort of a tale of two products Tyler. If you think about the core signature business versus the rest of the Agreement Cloud, primarily CLM to the first part of that no change. I don't think we've seen anything fundamentally different. And quite frankly, if you think about during COVID, we didn't see the nature of the signature transactions different, they just were fast, right. And so, we saw again that acceleration occur. And as Cynthia pointed out, as we're kind of rounding those quarters and in many ways, I think, starting to move into whatever the new normal will be. We're still seeing accelerated rate of that customer demand. But I wouldn't say the size of the transactions are bigger, I think we still land at about the same size. And I think our incremental expansions of the businesses they happen in the same increments, maybe just more of them are occurring across each time here. That's how I think about it. With CLM, of course, it was dramatically different, right. So, it was some really nice demand was starting to build right before the pandemic. And those, what I would say are more strategic and more substantive transactions. They require usually a statement of work and sort of systems integrator work whether we do the services, is one of our wonderful SI partners. Those are, again by definition, I think a little more complex and the order size density bigger. Those slowed way down, right. People said during the pandemic, we need to focus on really fast ROI. And this is enabling people to deal with working remotely. Now, we see those starting to come back. And so, we see the pipeline starting to build, as we did actually starting in Q4, started more aggressively there. So those are demonstrably coming back. And I think those will be larger deal sizes that we would see. But they don't cross over between signature at least you need to look at them in two separate sites. Yes, I don't think there's anything substantial. There are a couple of things that were new, like, you think about the PPP loans, right. There's a small little cottage industry that got built in supporting the banks. So, by definition, since that didn't exist before that was new. But that's really small piece of what we would do. I think you have to think about, just talk about we hit our one millionth customer. We've got a lot of customers. We've got a lot of industry coverage there. And I actually look at it this way and we sometimes say, we believe that every business eventually should use DocuSign. And that's the kind of the way we think about the breadth. But I don't look at sort of particular industries where we've not started that journey. I don't think there's big areas that you've mapped it out to say, we just haven't been able to find a way to serve them because we do the front office and the back-office use cases. And every company sort of has employees as an internal operation and every company has customers, right. I guess a few Silicon Valley companies have potentially that. But other than that, pretty much everyone has customers. And so, from that standpoint, I think, we really look at it as we are everywhere and we're going to be everywhere in the anywhere economy. And there hasn't been a phenomenon that COVID, or anything else with change to sort of open up or introduce new areas. There's international expansion into new geographies, for sure. But from a vertical standpoint I haven't seen anything that feels fundamentally just a new thing going forward. Yes, it's actually something funny. Before each earnings call Cynthia and I spent time with the team talking about pricing and talking about just sort of the tenor in the market. We do that so that when we get questions like this with people like you, we're able to give you the latest and greatest. And the pricing has been in a good way, boring as it has been for pretty much every quarter since we went public, but we haven't seen a lot of change there. In terms of the deal cycle time, we definitely saw some shortened cycle times at the height of the pandemic where there were people who were calling us up, especially on the NewCo side. So, people, we didn't have a previous relationship and they were really in a hurry. So, you go on DocuSign and that definitely reduce some cycle time, as well as some implementation time. I'd say that was probably reverted back to more normal. At this point we don't have that, that sense of urgency to be deployed might've had. I wouldn't say that was a significant portion of our business to play it out that way. And remember, in any given quarter, the amount of revenue that comes from new companies versus coming from our base NewCo is obviously very small. And we didn't see that dramatic change in the existing customers because they were relatively quick in the cycle time for new use cases, you don't have a contracting sort of NSA kind of requirements there. So, I think that there's something there, I wouldn't say it's significant, but it has reverted to what it would have been before from a cycle time. Yes, I think you hit it really well. Yes, there was some perhaps unexpected strength as you said on that dimension, we're obviously pleased by that strength. On the web and mobile side, I think, that there's two things that we've done well, that's allowed us to grow, and reach this goal that we set several years ago, hitting a million customers and primarily driven by that team. So that's where the largest number of our customers exists. The first thing is, I think, we're getting better and better at our online advertising. I think we built that as a key discipline to our long-term success. And I think that's been a huge part of driving that. Second thing is, we're continuing to innovate around our overall digital experience and that process by which people come through, they hit do a trial after they've put that on an online ad generally the most common way. And we take them through a trial process. They see the quality of our software. We make it easier and easier for them to become a customer, and that digital flow. I think it's still a ton of work that we can be better at that, but we have made a lot of effort in the last 18 months there. And I think some of that is starting to pay off that has driven that. One last thing I'll just add important to understand is really shout out for the web and mobile team. We look at their net ad, part of what's net out of that is people upgrade, become direct customers. So, some of their most successful, actually almost all of their most successful customers we take them. We take them and we put them into our direct business. And so that's a group that constantly has to replenish and grow and even faster rate to make up from the fact that we have what we call positive churn. We churn them out of web and mobile and churn them into the direct businesses to expand and take on more fulsome use of our platform with more advanced functionality. And so, from that standpoint I do think that that group, glad you pointed it out, has really been far for us. Yes. As is the case prior the vast, vast majority of both the 300,000 up are growth customers, as opposed to net new. It's not that we've never had someone start there, but our land and expand model, we're not really trying to go out and find that, because of our customer success orientation, we really believe the best way to build the long-term value, is to go out and start small, find some great use cases, deliver fantastic customer success, tremendous ROI, and grow the business and doing out, trying to get giant plans that are complex. I just don't think that's the model that really fits for the Agreement Cloud business. So that's definitely the case. And in terms of the strength there, I mean, I think it's highly correlated with the other key metrics that Cynthia is walking through. When you see a really high net retention rate, it means that the companies that were 250, a bunch of them grew, and they're now at 300. So, there's not any particular surprise there. It's just a continued land and expand step that is a number that has some volatility. We know it go back and look over the quarters there are times when, because of the puts and takes for any individual accounts and the way they might be adding things. Sometimes someone does a one-time add to the pop-up over 300 and then they do that that one-time time use case they might've had, might pop-down below in the next quarter. So, we do think it's important to look at that over time as opposed to any one quarter. But I think you're going to see over time while we keep delivering that same fantastic customer success, we will see that number continue to scale for the reasons particularly. Yes, absolutely. So, couple of thoughts for you. The first is, I believe that at the sort of technological level, I don't think there's anything that we would point to. There are really important differences in legal frameworks. I mean, we talk a lot about the concept of the common law versus the civil law, legal frameworks, but we deal with these pretty much made the investments to enable the civil law countries, which are the mass majority of countries out there. So, we made those investments really several years ago. And I think we feel good about what we've done there. There is sort of data residency issue, if you want to consider that sort of a technical component. And it could be a governor to the extent that some geographies, certain institutions that say, we don't want to let any data leave our national wall so to speak, most of the government clients feel that way, but sometimes you do see that with like large financial institutions or heavily regulated industries. And so sometimes there is complexity there, and that's why we've been working Azure to have in both Canada and Australia sort of leveraging the public cloud and maintaining those testing that. Trying to determine is that really, enable us to grow faster. I think it's an area we continue to be testing and working on. I wouldn't say, yes, we found there's a massive turbocharge there. But I think it is an area for continued investment in growth. That's the only things I would sort of point to from either a technological or a legal framework. I do think there's important things like market awareness, and obviously, particularly, because of our strengths in real estate early on DocuSign became more of a household name in the United States. We don't have that in most of the countries. So that's a big component. But I think we need to work on. And I think there's other things that we still have big opportunity for us to sort of get our house in order of the way that we operate in certain other countries. And we feel more local. I think that's another area that I'd say we sort of invest in. Wouldn't exactly call it technological, but there's sort of just a building the business the areas we're heavily focused on. And in terms of the second half of your question, in terms of the markets, we've talked a lot about our focus eight, and those are the original eight countries over the last several years we've said are our primary focus areas in Europe, that's the UK, Ireland, call one that France and Germany, in the Americas, that's U.S., Canada, and then Brazil, which has been really entirety of our LATAM focus, then Australia, New Zealand we call that one country. And then finally Japan would be the focus eight countries we're talking about. And I think now you're going to see us talk about the investment in Mexico and thinking about, really thinking of that as regional, sort of Spanish speaking LATAM, although Mexico itself, we started in a few months later decided to dramatically increase our investment in terms of on the ground, because we've seen so much positive response there in Mexico itself. From a European standpoint, I think, we've always seen opportunity in Nordics, in Netherlands. We see more in Southern Europe. I think there's opportunities in each of those geographies there. I don't know that it will be massive sort of feet on the ground there, but you are going to see us do more in those areas. And then in Asia-Pac overall, we're pleased with what we've got AMZ [ph] in Japan, very small presence in Singapore. And we're starting to look at Southeast Asia as a really key investment area. In fact, Mike and I were literally this morning talking about that growth investment there and leveraging that small, small toe in the water we have to go after what we think could be a really attractive market opportunity. But that's across thinking about Philippine, thinking about Thailand, thinking about what are those core countries in Southeast Asia that we think should fit well for DocuSign. So that's how we're thinking about the geographic footprint. Yes, I mean, the way I look at it is still the tip of the sphere is going to be signature for sure. And part of it is what Cynthia was describing earlier, we didn't have a much larger business there. And even though it's still, as she said, very early innings we have such a substantive leadership position. And we just see so much opportunity to continue to land there. That will be our primary entry point, I think, to most companies. Then, as you indicated in your question Brad, we want to really open up the rest of the Agreement Cloud. And I do believe that areas today that we see is that natural extension second step, CLM and the advanced analytics will increasingly be some of one-two punch. One of our goals is to really integrate some of that field technology and that AI technology into our CLM solution. We feel for a lot particularly about mid-market and up customers. That's going to be a key buying factor, is the idea that you have embedded fantastic analytic capability onto that CLM solution. And we're seeing with the analytics on top of just Insight, even this fantastic new product we have called DocuSign Monitor, which is really a security product for people to understand what's happening in their network by looking at how people are signing agreements with that. We're seeing huge uptake from customers where they just want to understand more about the business, and our whole thesis around the Seal acquisition, the idea that companies can run their business better with a really thoughtful Agreement Cloud. They can be smarter about the way they grow and execute their core operations. So that is definitely how we think about it. And I think the number of use cases for your question continue to accelerate as people see the business value in the ROI from using our advanced analytics, particularly the AI aspect of our business. Well, I'll give you my thoughts and then Cynthia can dive and give you a different perspective of your own favorites maybe you want to pick. I mean, I think that you got to look at TAM. I mean we we're planning this for the long-term. And so even though I look at something like notary and I just have a huge amount of enthusiasm for it, I think, it's in many ways an extension right, of signing type experience. And so, I think, it's a special and really important opportunity to bring the joy that DocuSign has brought to signature world to extend that to notary. But I think the total TAM there, isn't going to allow it to be a pillar. The same way that CLM is. I think CLM is going to be emerging software category within the Agreement Cloud that, several years from now, we're going to look back and say someone would be crazy to have an eSignature solution. Today, if we look at it that way. I think we now will look at CLM and we get to that a few years down the road where people would be crazy not to be thinking about the way they manage their contracts across the business. That's probably what I would pick as sort of the big winner, if you will, and what will contribute in the most substantial way to our growth over the long-term. Cynthia, if you have any updates different than that? Yes, I mean, I think, the simplest way to look at the distribution as you know headcount is by far are number one costs. So, if you take a look at how it played out in terms of the percentage of our revenue, a percentage of our revenue attributable to each of the buckets, you'll see that sales and marketing and product engineering were by far the two groups that we've traditionally supported. And that will be the same thing in this quarter and then look forward across the year. Those are the core groups that I'd like to see the most headcount growth. And from a philosophy standpoint, I oftentimes talk about this concept of, we kind of have line functions and then we have functions that support this. And the support functions are just as important as the line function, but I really to scale our business need to scale the line function. So, we need to have a lot of fantastic engineers here building great software, because we're a software company. And so, the number of engineers that we can grow that is a huge, important driver of our future growth. The same thing is true. If you think about our quarter carrying, AEs or our CSMs that are driving customer success, those are the functions that we really want to see the headcount growing. And people like me and Cynthia were overhead and we like ourselves fine, but we don't need any more of us. One CFO is fine, CEO is fine, and we want to really focus ourselves on getting more leverage in those lines of operations. Thank you all for joining us. You saw Annie at the top, she mentioned we're going to be out in the market a little bit, I guess, virtually hopefully soon we'll be out physically. But thank you for joining us. And we look forward to talking to you all next quarter. See you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the website following this call. [Operator Instructions] I will now pass the call over to Heather Harwood, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHeather Harwood: Thank you, operator.

I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter marked my first full quarter as DocuSign\u2019s CEO. Having led our organization for five months with the opportunity to meet many of our customers, partners and employees, I\u2019m even more optimistic today about the future of DocuSign. We had a solid finish to a transitional year, delivering across key financial metrics in Q4 while making tangible progress against our key priorities. Q4 total revenue came in at $660 million, up 14% versus prior year, finishing the year with $2.5 billion of revenue and 19% year-on-year growth. Driven by our continued focus on profitability and efficiency, we reported 24% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter and 21% for the year. While we are pleased with our Q4 results, I also want to acknowledge today\u2019s challenging macro environment. Customer sentiment continues to be cautious, and that is reflected in moderated expansion rates. Before we get further into business updates, I want to acknowledge today\u2019s news that Cynthia Gaylor has decided to step down from her role as Chief Financial Officer. Cynthia has been with DocuSign for nearly 4.5 years, first as a Board member and Chair of our Audit Committee and last few years as our CFO. I know many of you know Cynthia well and gotten to know her even better over time as part of the DocuSign story. I want to thank Cynthia for her unwavering commitment and strategic leadership these last few years. She\u2019s been a great partner to me during my first month as CEO, and she\u2019s been instrumental to the company and the Board as we\u2019ve navigated a period of dynamic change while laying a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth at scale. I thank her for her support during the transition as we search for a successor. Let me turn back to the business. During Q4, we refined and communicated DocuSign strategy throughout our organization to drive greater alignment on how our teams can deliver more strategic value to our customers. Today, we have a clearly defined strategy in place. To underscore the key pillars of our strategic vision, inspired by customer feedback, our focus is to deliver smarter, easier and trusted agreements. We\u2019re improving the reach and efficiency of our go-to-market by developing a world-class self-serve experience, strengthening our direct sales productivity and amplifying our sales and marketing partnerships. We\u2019re also strengthening our internal operational efficiency by optimizing and modernizing systems and processes. Now, it\u2019s important to emphasize that even as the market leader in e-signature, we are just at the beginning of capitalizing on the opportunities to redefine and truly reimagine what a smarter agreement looks like. Today eSign provides an online replica of a static document. While that is a huge improvement in convenience and productivity for senders and signers, it\u2019s hardly the endpoint. Just like creating digital copies of maps or recorded music was the beginning of a reimagination of long-established categories, fundamentally altering creation, distribution and use. Our goal is to turn flat agreements into structured data that can be used to make intelligent decisions. Value of an agreement is in the data. Every step of an agreement can deliver more value when it\u2019s automated, intelligent and seamlessly integrated into core business systems. DocuSign is uniquely positioned to redefine the agreement processes across every industry. Along these lines, we released several new product enhancements during the fourth quarter, including expanded integrations to better collaborate with Microsoft Teams, Slack and Zoom. And for eSignature, we enabled new AI-assisted document highlighting and signing capabilities in mobile and web for faster time to value. In April, we will release WebForms which will help customers deliver a better and simpler experience by moving from legacy contract forms to a modern web and app experience. We also plan to accelerate our release cycles in fiscal 2024 with innovative and differentiated solutions that simplify the agreement process, while we identify new ways to revolutionize how businesses initiate, negotiate and manage agreements. There\u2019s substantial interest in the industry about rapid advances in AI and large language models in particular. We are already leveraging sophisticated AI models for contract analysis and automation of some workflows, and we\u2019re very excited to harness generative AI, data and pattern identification, as yet another way we can increase productivity, reduce friction and save our customers\u2019 time. As we move forward, we believe these can be a compelling part of our business, and we are encouraged by the significant interest from some of the very largest players in our industry, who recognize our domain leadership and expertise and want to partner with us. Moving to our product led growth and self-serve initiatives. We\u2019ve made solid progress over the last few months, modernizing our commerce experience to reduce friction, improve ease of use and provide customers more flexibility. We\u2019ve expanded seat capacity available via our web and mobile sites, we\u2019ve expanded currency options available to make the buying process easier in international markets. Gain traction with these initiatives as we exited the quarter, and we will continue to keep you updated on our progress. Further, as you saw in an announcement a few weeks ago, I couldn\u2019t be more excited to have Robert Chatwani, joining our team as President and General Manager of Growth. Robert brings a wealth of experience, and we look forward to benefiting from his insights and expertise for more than two decades of scaling global technology companies. He joins DocuSign from an organization that\u2019s broadly recognized as having a world-class product-led growth motion. Executing on our product growth strategy is a key priority for the company as it will be a primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion and expansion. I\u2019m thrilled to have Robert leading our efforts in this area. Turning to our go-to-market. We\u2019re just coming off our global sales kickoff last week, and I can tell you that the sales team is incredibly excited and energized for the year ahead. We\u2019re focused on delivering across three complementary channels: direct, self-serve and partners, and to provide world-class customer success in driving customer growth and retention through all three. As an example of global growth and multiproduct expansion, this past quarter, a leading global consulting firm, who has been using eSignature for a decade, expanded and added our CLM cost product. This is a competitive sales cycle since the customer is already in the process of implementing a competitor CLM solution in a few countries. However, DocuSign won preferred vendor status for CLM and the customer has since rolled us out in six countries across two continents and has built integrations with their internal systems and the DocuSign partners Salesforce and ServiceNow. Related to go-to-market, I want to acknowledge the restructuring we recently announced. It was a difficult decision but it was a critically important step for our company to reshape and rightsize our organization for the opportunity ahead. It was not a broad-based restructuring. 95% of the workforce reduction was in our worldwide field organization. Our assessment was that DocuSign could capture more efficiency in our overall go-to-market across all segments and that we could unlock more profitable growth by investing part of the savings in product development and innovation. Now, the direct channel remains absolutely critical to our future. We are rebalancing our approach towards offering a lighter touch experience with more self-serve capabilities that give customers of all sizes, choice in how they engage with DocuSign. That pivot in turn frees up resources to invest more in our self-service motion and expanded road map for agreement workflows, new AI capabilities, accelerating our migration to the cloud and improving our internal systems. That, in turn, will create an even stronger and more valuable offering for our customers and for our sales team to sell. Still have some work to do to strengthen our self-serve experience over the next 6 to 12 months. And while we may see some modest near-term disruption, we\u2019re confident these are the right steps, going forward to drive innovation and growth for our customers for the long term. Additionally, a stronger self-serve motion will enable greater expansion opportunities internationally. Turning to our internal operations and processes, Anwar Akram recently joined as our Chief Operating Officer and will play a crucial role within our organization. Anwar\u2019s focus is to bring together and transform our strategy, develop new strategies around pricing and packaging, driving incremental efficiencies internally and help evolve early-stage ideas into future growth initiatives. Related to these efforts, I noted on the last call, that we rolled out product bundles to introduce more features and functionalities to our customers. I\u2019m pleased to share that these bundled promotions performed better than expected, and we saw good adoption for our new SMB customers in particular. Our experience suggests that customers that adopt a broader set of features, renew and expand their commitment with us. You should expect to see more initiatives around pricing and packaging in the future, including bundling and ensuring early adoption of our highest value features. Finally, I would like to update you on our partner ecosystem, another key pillar of our strategy. We\u2019re seeing good progress with a number of our largest software partners. ServiceNow is a good example, highlighted by the launch of the CLM Spoke as part of ServiceNow\u2019s automation engine. Our partnership has gained momentum with several leading organizations utilizing our integration to digitize their agreements. This is directly aligned with our focus on capturing opportunities by integrating more deeply with partner applications. So, in closing, this year has been one of incredible change for DocuSign. And in Q4, we made meaningful strides towards defining our strategy, rightsizing and optimizing our organization. We believe the foundation has been set and that we are in a better position to navigate the evolving macro environment while investing for opportunities that enable long-term profitable growth. We\u2019re optimistic about the year ahead for DocuSign, and we\u2019re committed to delivering meaningful customer and shareholder value. We look forward to sharing further progress on our initiatives as we redefine how the world comes together and agrees. We will enable smarter, easier and trusted agreements. With that, let me once again thank Cynthia and turn the call over to her to walk through the financials. Cynthia?\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks, Allan, for the kind words. I\u2019d like to start off by thanking our employees [Technical Difficulty] execution. We closed out the year strong, and I\u2019m proud to share that we achieved an impressive milestone for the Company, delivering $2.5 billion of revenue for the fiscal year, reflecting 19% growth year-on-year. Our Q4 results were solid, demonstrating the durability in our business model and DocuSign\u2019s important position in the broader ecosystem. While we are pleased with our results and execution in Q4, we continue to experience a challenging macro environment with softening demand trends, including moderating expansion rates. However, we are seeing healthy results as customers recognize that DocuSign offers high ROI applications that are easy to use, efficient and cost effective. With that, let me turn to our Q4 and fiscal \u201823 results. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $660 million, and subscription revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $644 million. Total revenue for the year reached $2.5 billion, a 19% increase over last year and subscription revenue was $2.4 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase. Our international revenue grew 19% year-over-year to reach $165 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, international revenue grew 29% to $260 million, representing 25% of total revenue for both periods. Fourth quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $739 million. For the full year, billings increased 13% to $2.7 billion. We added approximately 30,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total installed base to $1.36 million at the end of the year, a 16% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 9,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 211,000, a 24% year-over-year increase. We also saw a 27% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,080 customers. Dollar net retention was 107% for the quarter. The headwinds we\u2019ve highlighted over the last couple of quarters continued to persist. And as a result, we are seeing muted growth in our expansion rates. We expect this to continue into Q1, and as a result, would expect the dollar net retention in Q1 to trend lower. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 83% compared with 81% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was 82%, in line with last quarter. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 85%, consistent with last year. For the full year, subscription gross margin was also 85%, flat versus prior years. Q4 non-GAAP operating income reached $155 million compared with $104 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24% compared to 18% last year. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income rose 23% to $570 million and operating margin was 21% versus 20% in fiscal 2022. In Q4, we saw lower expenses for employee-related costs related to the workforce reduction announced in September, which contributed to the strong operating margin in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $133 million compared with $100 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, non-GAAP net income was $419 million, up from $411 million in fiscal \u201822, a growth rate of 2% year-over-year. As noted on our Q1 call last year, we introduced a non-GAAP tax rate on our non-GAAP net income calculation for fiscal \u201823 as we reached consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior three years. We are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal \u201824. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.65, while full year non-GAAP EPS was $2.03. Let me take this opportunity to share a bit more context regarding the recent restructuring. As Allan mentioned, this was a difficult decision and one not made lightly, but it was an important decision aligned with our strategy to reshape the Company and free up resources to invest in critical areas across our innovation and product development efforts. As we outlined in the filing last month, we expect to incur related restructuring charges ranging from $25 million to $35 million, with the majority of the expenses and related cash to be incurred in Q1 of this year, with the restructuring substantially completed by the end of the second quarter. We ended Q4 with 7,336 employees compared to 7,461 last year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 56% year-over-year to $137 million, representing a 21% margin. This compares with $88 million, a 15% margin in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was $113 million, a 17% margin compared to $70 million, a 12% margin in the year prior, a 61% increase year-over-year. As we mentioned on our last call, we went live with a new ERP in Q3 which delayed some of our cash collections last quarter. As a result, we saw strong cash collections this quarter in addition to lower restructuring cash payments on a relative basis. For the full year, operating cash flow was $507 million, representing a 20% margin compared to $506 million, a 24% margin a year ago. Free cash flow declined 4% year-over-year to $429 million, a 17% margin compared to $445 million, a 21% margin to fiscal 2022. We exited Q4 with more than $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. With that, let me turn to our Q1 and fiscal \u201824 guidance. As a reminder, on our Q3 earnings call, we provided a preliminary outlook for fiscal \u201824. We are pleased to narrow the preliminary range we provided, incorporating our Q4 landing and the dynamics of the current environment into our guidance. We anticipate the macro environment will remain challenging as we move through the year. And as Allan mentioned, we may also see modest near-term disruption as we realign our sales force and shift to more of a self-serve motion. For the first quarter and fiscal year \u201824, we anticipate total revenue of $639 million to $643 million in Q1 or growth of 9% year-over-year. And $2.695 billion to $2.707 billion for fiscal \u201824 or growth of 7% to 8% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $625 million to $629 million in Q1 or growth of 10% to 11% year-over-year. And $2.633 billion to $2.645 billion for fiscal \u201824 or growth of 8% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $615 million to $625 million in Q1 or flat to 2% growth year-over-year and $2.705 billion to $2.725 billion for fiscal \u201824 or growth of 2% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both, Q1 and the fiscal year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 21% to 22% for Q1 and 21% to 23% for fiscal \u201824. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $207 million to $212 million for both Q1 and fiscal \u201824. Fiscal \u201823 was a year of transition, and we are pleased with our execution and the progress we are making as we navigate a challenging macro environment. We remain committed to delivering sustainable growth and profitability at scale, and we will continue to be disciplined with our investments across strategic priorities. We are focused on delivering long-term value to our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the steps we are taking and look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. The journey to $2.5 billion has been hard work and a testament to the compelling value proposition DocuSign brings to our customers. Together, we have played an important role in how the world agrees. I look forward to the future. And finally, I\u2019ll be here a little while longer, as Allan said, so no goodbye\u2019s for now. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, we will be polled for questions. Our first question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thank you. Cynthia, congratulations on your next move. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. I wanted to ask one on the moderating expansion activity that you saw during the quarter. Was it a certain cohort of customer where you saw that? Was it across the board? Was it in that enterprise cohort or just the broader base? Just any color on that? And any segments that you might have seen that occur? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks, Brad. Yes. So, I think on the expansion rate, I think it\u2019s a continuing trend that we\u2019ve been talking about from -- over the last few quarters, which is, as the book of business has grown and the macro environment has softened, the rate at which customers are expanding is slowing. So that growth rate and expansion is slowing. And so, I would say, there wasn\u2019t a big change in Q4 relative to the couple of quarters before but it is a continuing trend that\u2019s putting some pressure on the top line. On the cohorts, we actually do, do a lot of analysis on the cohorts. And I would say some of the cohorts are probably expanding at a slower rate and some are moderating the rate at which they\u2019re expanding. But I\u2019d say overall, it\u2019s having the same impact. And part of it is, as we\u2019ve talked about in past quarters, is a little bit of a law of large numbers as that book of business gets bigger, you need more and more expansion dollars to move in. And so customers are still expanding. But when you look at the top line, that\u2019s probably the biggest factor kind of impacting the compression of some of those growth rates.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Allan, just on the sales overhaul. Can you just talk to how long you expect this to send kind of wake turbulence through the sales organ when you feel like you kind of resume full strength? And I had a quick follow-up for Cynthia. Just as it relates to the billings growth decel from 13% to 2%. Can you just give us a sense of kind of what you\u2019re factoring into that?\nAllan Thygesen: I\u2019ll go first. Thanks, Brent. I think on the sales force, so I\u2019d say, I think we are in a significantly more stable situation than 6, 12 months ago. Attrition rates have slowed. We\u2019ve got, I think, a pretty full team in place. Steve has done a very nice job with that. There\u2019s more better execution, better predictability. Part of what gave us the confidence to take the restructuring action was in fact that and that we could see what our sales capacity was, and we felt we had a little bit of excess capacity there as well as a keen understanding of where we could deinvest and free up resources to invest elsewhere. So, we\u2019re being cautious in saying there could be a little bit of disruption as some of the -- particularly the very low end, some of the business that might previously have had a little bit of human touch, we\u2019ll try to do that more particularly through our self-serve motion. But I think that should play out in a relatively very quick order over 1 to 2 quarters. But I think the sales force is actually in the best place it\u2019s been for a while. We just had our global kickoff last week in I think I\u2019m presenting them saying that they\u2019re incredibly energized by the road map. And they all have slightly larger territories, now too. So, it\u2019s a very positive feel I think, throughout the sales team.\nCynthia Gaylor: I\u2019ll take the billings question. But before I do that, I realize I misspoke on international revenue. So just to clarify, international revenue grew 29% to $620 million. I think I said $250 million, just a clarification there. On the billings question, I think it\u2019s related to a couple of things. One is, as we talked about last quarter, we\u2019re expecting a slower start to the year. I think when you look at the macro environment, we certainly haven\u2019t gotten better and you could probably sense just maybe gotten a little bit worse. And on top of that, we have made some changes to the fields, which we think could cause some disruption. So I think that\u2019s certainly playing into both the revenue and the billings guide we\u2019re giving to the year. I\u2019d also say we always guide to what we can see. I think we can see Q1 better than we can see the rest of the year. But given the 1% guide in Q1, we would expect that to kind of improve as we move through the year and some of the investments we may start to take hold. So I think those are some of the dynamics kind of...\nOperator: Our next question is from Jackson Ader with SVB.\nJackson Ader: First one, on the macro environment, how does the macro environment actually impact you? Is it -- is it number of employees at your customers are coming down and so they don\u2019t need as many envelopes? I\u2019d be surprised if it were the DocuSign line item is like getting a bunch of scrutiny and IT budgets or something. But just given the ROI and the traditionally very quick payback, I would think that e-signature would be a place where people are actually like more willing to invest in a tough macro environment. So, how do I square that?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is the overall macro environment just affects businesses of all sizes and their ability and willingness to spend on all kinds of software, including ours. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re particularly more macro sensitive or a little less than others. In terms of the industry mix in the economy, we do have a little bit of over exposure, if you will, to real estate and a few other sectors that have been a little tougher. On the other hand, we are quite diversified and have some real strength in sectors like health and manufacturing, telecommunications. So that\u2019s balancing out. In terms of the value prop, I agree with your statement. I think there\u2019s a very quick payback. I think we\u2019re seeing that. So customers -- and that\u2019s also a key part of DocuSign\u2019s competitive value proposition vis-\u00e0-vis other competitors, people tend to respond fast. They\u2019re more likely to respond to an agreement. They\u2019re more -- they\u2019re faster to respond and they have a better positive experience. So overall, I think the macro environment presents some clouds for IT budgets of companies of all sizes. We are seeing maybe a little bit more vertical exposure than the average company but are generally pretty balanced. And I think our value prop remains quite strong.\nJackson Ader: Okay. All right. Great. And then a very quick follow-up. The -- how much of the like second kind of round of restructuring was factored into the preliminary margin guidance for the year that was given, Cynthia, on last quarter\u2019s call?\nCynthia Gaylor: Thanks for the question. So to be clear, in the outlook we provided, the most recent restructuring was not factored [Technical Difficulty] we were evaluating the scenarios for this fiscal year as part of our annual plan in areas that we want to invest in across the strategic priorities. But that wasn\u2019t contemplated specifically at the time or baked into the outlook we provided. That being said, I think as we went through the process of the annual [Technical Difficulty] it was clear that we needed more room for investment across the key priorities. And as Allan articulated, the plan is to invest in R&D in particular and innovation and kind of shift some of the investments into that initiative as well as PLG self-serve. So, we were able to come a little bit above the outlook we provided. If you remember in Q3 on margin, we said at the low end of our long-term target range, which is 20% to 22%, the long-term target range as a reminder, is 20% to 25%, and our guide for the year is 21% to 23%. So, we are going to be reinvesting, but we also increased the margin by a little bit.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Just going back to the sales reorg and kind of the strategy moving forward and the move to a self-serve model. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that and just kind of what your vision is for the Company? And where do you kind of make the threshold for when a sale becomes self-service? Is it -- is it at a certain deal size, or maybe do you only have salespeople by industry or specialization, like CLM? If you could elaborate on that? And then, just a quick follow-up for Cynthia. Just given that we\u2019ve seen a cumulative risk of close to 20% of the workforce. What -- I guess, why wouldn\u2019t margins be higher for next year? You did about 24% EBIT margin on a non-GAAP basis here in Q4 and I think that was without a lot of the benefits you\u2019re seeing from the cost savings. So I guess, why wouldn\u2019t we see higher margins in that next year, given 20% lower headcount?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I\u2019ll take the first one. So, just our go-to-market, historically, DocuSign has been very heavily focused on a direct sales motion for customers of all sizes. And we will retain direct sales as our principal go-to-market channel, and it\u2019s a huge strength for the Company, and we certainly want to continue to improve there. But we feel we want to complement it in two areas. One is with the self-serve motion. And that\u2019s not just for little customers. That\u2019s for customers of all sizes. We just think that all customers appreciate an opportunity to self-serve for certain types of activities at all stages of their journey with us. And that -- I\u2019ll come back to that in a second. And then third, we are really focused on maturing our partner go-to-market where we can use distributors and resellers in some international markets, we can partner with ISVs to be directly embedded in their applications. We have significant activity there, what can meaningfully improve. Let me quickly return to the self-serve piece in particular. I want to make sure that it\u2019s clear, we want to stop treating digital and direct sales as separate channels over time. We essentially want to offer all customers the opportunity to self-serve if and when they wish. And I expect many customers will avail themselves of that. And then as a corollary, I want our sales teams to see the self-serve options as a positive complement to their activities. I think that\u2019s what we did at Google, I think that\u2019s Robert did at Atlassian, and I think that\u2019s what a lot of companies that are natively digital in their motion do, and I think we have a tremendous amount of opportunity there. So that\u2019s our overall go-to-market plan. Cynthia, do you want to take the second half?\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. Yes. So I totally understand the question. I would say Q4, the 24% margin was higher than probably what our steady rate is for a couple of reasons. One is we had just gone through the fall restructuring. So that really dropped to margin. And then, in addition, the hiring in Q4 was slower than we had anticipated in the quarter. So as we kind of look into this year, we see the opportunity in front of us, and we want to invest into the key pillars of the strategic priorities that Allan talked about, right, in the product, in innovation and then in PLG self-serve. And so, we\u2019re really putting that money from the second restructuring back into the business to really level set against those key areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Allan, maybe digging into the product bundling traction you\u2019re seeing, can you give us some color on the adoption rates with SMBs and maybe put that in perspective of what you\u2019re also seeing from competitors?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So first of all, on a segment basis, and I think Cynthia alluded to this, we have first of all, a very balanced customer portfolio. So, we have a significant SMB and mid-market business and a big emphasis on growing our enterprise business. And I\u2019d say on balance, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a huge difference in momentum between those sectors. I know some companies are reporting particular challenges in SMB. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing that. In fact, we had some nice momentum on new accounts in particular. So, I was pleased to see that. I think in terms of -- that was the segment piece. What was the other part of your question?\nGeorge Iwanyc: Just what you think from a competitive perspective on competition.\nAllan Thygesen: Okay. There\u2019s no question that over the last three to five years, the market has gotten more competitive. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re seeing a material change in how competitive it is here in the last few quarters. I think we continue to be the market leader. We don\u2019t spend as much time worrying about what other people are doing, I think we want to really redefine the category and set the direction for the industry. And I think we\u2019re well on our way to doing that. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused from a competitive standpoint, if you will. In terms of the tactics, we are looking on pricing and packaging and how can we be as agile as possible by segment, by country. There might be a few countries where we\u2019ve gotten a little too far off the market. And so, we\u2019re looking at that very carefully. I mentioned some bundling opportunities during my prepared remarks. So, we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities there. There\u2019s some enterprise license agreements. Some of our largest customers, we really want to the ubiquitous eSignature solution for -- in every instance where they want to deploy that. And so we\u2019re in the process of both building out the product to enable that for embedding as well as direct sales and in structuring our license agreements so that that is as attractive as possible for our large clients.\nCynthia Gaylor: One thing I would just add on the SMB, we could see -- we did see some relative strength there relative -- across our business. And we ran some experiments in Q4, particularly around the bundles or around increasing number of seats. So, we did see kind of a higher volume of SMB deals at lower price points. So, higher volume, lower price, which we thought, especially like in NewCo was a positive sign, as Allan mentioned. So just a little bit more color there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.\nScott Berg: Congrats on the strong finish to the year. I guess, Allan, I wanted to focus on product strategy going forward because product seems to be a big theme of where you want to invest in going forward. But leveraging off your WebForms comments, how should we think about your product road map maybe over the next, I don\u2019t know, 12 to 24 months? Is it going to be more of a little small add-on solutions like what WebForms is likely to bring at least from what my assumptions are of that product? Or is there an opportunity to see some product that may be a little bit more transformational something that could give your sales and maybe bookings or billings more of an uplift going forward?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Actually, I think WebForms has a little bit more potential than that. We\u2019re very optimistic because I think it really -- it epitomizes the transformation of agreement with sort of a static representation of a traditional form to completely new customer experiences. And the other thing it does, of course, is it makes it much easier to capture all the meta data around the agreements, which is really where we\u2019re heading in the longer term. As you think about what we want to do is we want to decompose agreements into dynamic objects that can be filled both with data from the customer side and from the signer side. And WebForms is the first step of that process. There\u2019s a lot more coming in the remainder of the year along those lines. So, we\u2019re quite bullish on the cumulative impact of all of those launches. But obviously, version 1.0 will have some gaps. In terms of the transformational piece, I think I touched a little on the AI piece. I -- we have a lot of opportunity there. And so, we have some -- we will be making some announcements on that later this spring, as the beginning of a new product in that area. And over time, I think the work that we\u2019re doing now to completely revamp how we leverage AI is very exciting. So, if you think about the application of AI in the agreement space, a lot of the excitement right now around ChatGPT and the other -- and the competitors are around basically text generation, and that has an obvious analogy to the agreement space of drafting contracts. And we do think that\u2019s very exciting and that there\u2019s value to be captured there, and we will absolutely pursue that. But, if you look at where companies actually find value from agreements, it would be more in the extraction of data and value out of the agreements as well as the search and analytics on that. And you can also apply AI to that. And that\u2019s an area where I think we are uniquely positioned to deliver very compelling value, and we got a number of large customers who are very excited to work with us on that type of next-generation AI activity. I don\u2019t think -- that\u2019s not going to hit in the next couple of quarters. But in terms of the longer-term road map and delivering on our vision, it\u2019s incredibly exciting and could really provide transformational growth.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.\nRishi Jaluria: Two here. First, I wanted to start -- kind of reembracing more of your routes around self-service and PLG. Allan, I think the strategy makes a ton of sense and should actually help yourselves efficiency as well. From a product standpoint, is there anything that you need to do to make kind of that self-service PLG motion more intuitive or easier, especially outside of your mobile customers, right? If we think about even the mid-market customers, there should be a lot more self-service capabilities. Just anything that you need to invest in or expand from a product perspective? And then, I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So, first of all, I think, look, when people first hear self-serve, they think of don\u2019t you already have a website and can\u2019t people order on your website. And of course, yes, we do, and yes, they can. But what I\u2019m talking about is a significantly more transformational effort where customers can discover, try, embrace and really deploy products without ever engaging with a DocuSign employee, and we can then engage with them as that potential is demonstrated and expressed and we can apply our sales forces really more efficiently. So, it becomes a huge multiplier for efficiency in our sales teams. And that\u2019s the model that companies like Atlassian has had pioneered over time and very excited to apply that at DocuSign. In terms of how that applies across segments, it\u2019s certainly true that you can imagine an SMB customer basically remaining a purely digital customer, and we would love that. But as customers grow in scope and potential and complexity, then the application of those sales resources becomes both more profitable for us and more necessary for the customer. And so, I do expect a heavier sales component as we -- as you move up market. Mid-market has always been a core strength for us and it remains a really important segment. A lot of our products -- you start there and you sort of grow out from there. So, I think that will remain a critical segment for DocuSign and very relevant for the self-serve -- expanded self-serve motion that I\u2019ve just described.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. That\u2019s really helpful. And then on the international front, I recall last quarter, there was kind of a talk of working closer with partners, especially in Japan, right, which is, as you know, very unique geography, especially when it comes to enterprise software. Just wondering if you can give an update specifically on your efforts in Japan and kind of building out the partner ecosystem, especially because at least it feels like your product is viewed as significantly better than the competition, and there\u2019s great branding out in Japan. But a lot of the kind of manual processes that need to be modernized, they feel a little bit behind. So, I would love to kind of think -- I hear how you\u2019re thinking about the Japan opportunity and partners there. Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. We are in active discussions internally exactly how we want to pursue Japan. I\u2019d say Germany is another market where I don\u2019t think we have fully lived up to our potential. And I agree with you, we\u2019re in a great starting position. Our initial forays into both of those markets were really mostly just a direct sales motion. We didn\u2019t put, I think, quite enough resources behind it and all the other functions, including product and our administrative functions. And as you noted, in markets like Japan, the road is littered with U.S. companies that have tried to go to Japan. So we\u2019re certainly going to be leveraging partners there. So stay tuned. I think we\u2019ll have more to report on both of those countries during the course of fiscal \u201824. But right now, it\u2019s sort of in the planning and decisioning exactly how we\u2019re going to pursue that. But those are definitely strategic priorities within our broader international strategy.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Great. I appreciate you taking the question. Can I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re already operating within the stated target range on margin? But I think some of the questions are just digging out a little bit more that it seems like you could potentially push even harder given the product-led growth background, the core efficient base of the business. So, why not do that with a little bit more emphasis here? And what informs the decision around balancing reinvesting into the product versus making sure the cuts you\u2019re making are the right size where you don\u2019t have to potentially go back again and make another tough decision?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I\u2019d say, first of all, we feel like we have turned the organization pretty well at this point and reallocated resources to where we\u2019d see the highest investment. Look, I agree with you. I think we were not sufficiently efficient from a sales and marketing perspective. I hope to make us more efficient over time. Until I see that, I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t want to be -- as Cynthia says, we want to project what we see. And -- but you can assume that there will be a lot of emphasis on getting increasingly efficient, even beyond what we have, but I\u2019m not ready to make any -- that part of our forecast at this time. But that would certainly be the hope and expectation that we can accelerate top line and improve efficiency over time.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: I would say maybe one other point on the investment piece. We feel we have a very significant opportunity. And we have been, I think, a little underinvested in innovation over the last couple of years. We had the -- and have the market-leading product and it remains an incredible value proposition. But I\u2019m excited to reinvigorate that and get us to capitalize on the larger opportunity that I outlined earlier on this call. And I think the whole team feels -- we already got some stuff coming out in Q1, and there will be a lot more over the next three quarters, and that will position us to -- for growth in future years.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. Allan, I think you labeled 2022 well in characterizing it as a year of change. So, if \u201822 is the year of change, what\u2019s 2023 the year of? Is it execution, stabilization, innovation, self-serve? Like, what word would you use to frame 2023?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think change and transition for calendar \u201822 -- fiscal \u201823. For this year, I think it\u2019s about setting the foundations for growth, and we are -- we\u2019re really leaning into that. I think we have a fantastic opportunity to capitalize on this very large TAM that we believe were pointed at. We are the market leader in e-signature and CLM. We are in the best position to capitalize on that opportunity, and we just need to go execute. So, that\u2019s the job this year. It\u2019s not quite as much of a turnaround transitional year as last year, it\u2019s much more of a foundation and preparation for growth building year.\nJosh Baer: That\u2019s great. And then, one other one. Just thinking about direct versus self-serve, versus partner channels, where -- what\u2019s the mix of business today and where do you want that to go in three years?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019ve reported in the past that 13% of our business is digital. But a lot of that is associated by the fact that there\u2019s only a small number of profits and options that you can find on our website. And so, we\u2019ve been pushing actively even relative to small customers to have to order from a sales rep which I will admit I was slightly shocked to learn when I joined. So, our goal is to dramatically grow the -- all the pieces of the business. And I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be as meaningful a year from now to talk about what\u2019s digital versus what\u2019s direct because -- in a lot of cases, our customer may order some things digitally and may talk to their sales rep about other things. And so, the whole thing becomes a little bit less clear. From a partner perspective, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve externally reported in our partner mix. It\u2019s a partner touched, it\u2019s a meaningful minority of our business, in terms of directly partners sold, that\u2019s a little smaller. I think both of those need to grow meaningfully. We don\u2019t have -- I alluded to this in my comments, just as one example. There\u2019s a big opportunity to embed our market-leading signature agreement workflow products directly into third-party products. We do some of that today, but we\u2019re not set up well to serve developers today. So we\u2019ve got a couple of quarters of work to do to really provide a world-class set of componentized tools that allow developers to pick and choose from all the things we have to create the most compelling agreement experiences inside of their products. That\u2019s going to be a really important growth driver. But I\u2019m not going at this time to comment on the exact magnitude.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Allan, I was wondering if you can just talk about sort of the industry strategy or the vertical strategy, both in terms of what you\u2019re doing with the sales organization, meaning are you going to turn some of that sort of industry focus over to partners? And, is there a way to build more sort of industry functionality into the product. So, it\u2019s just product led in that respect. I was just kind of curious if you could talk about the strategy on that basis. Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. It\u2019s a great question. I would say we\u2019re at the earlier phases of our verticalization strategy. We\u2019ve long had a special suite of tools for the real estate industry. I think they are best-in-class and we\u2019ll continue to tweak and improve on that. More recently, we\u2019ve done some, I think, really nice work, for example, in the healthcare space, where we\u2019ve added some compliance with a variety of federal regulations that enables our products to be used for healthcare applications, and that\u2019s driven some really nice growth. I think we have opportunities and this is an active part of our product planning to basically have our products sufficiently componentized that we can easily create custom workflows that are tailored to individual industries. So, I mean, obvious example, if you have something for mortgages, it\u2019s not that different from a loan application, it\u2019s not that different from an automotive car purchase. And those are all sectors that we already have business in and where I think we have opportunities to create deeper vertical agreements. Another example is government. And so, we have big opportunities in the government space as well. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got some work to do to really fully capitalize on the verticalization opportunity that you alluded to, which I totally agree with.\nOperator: Our last question is from Jake Roberge with William Blair.\nJake Roberge: Allan, you\u2019ve talked a lot about the reoptimization of those R&D resources. Is that more about going deeper into some of your less mature products that have big opportunities like CLM, or is it about building the self-serve and more frictionless e-signature capabilities that you\u2019ve talked a lot about? And which of those opportunities do you see the larger -- see being larger as we move forward?\nAllan Thygesen: It\u2019s really across all of those. So, we are absolutely directing investment dollars towards accelerating our product like growth motion, and so that absolutely. But in addition to that, we direct additional investment dollars into accelerating our agreement workflow road map into the CLM space and into our cloud migration. I think many of you are aware that we\u2019re in the process of migrating our suite to Microsoft Azure, a very strong relationship with Microsoft. And this is a really important year for that migration to move some of the core workloads and some of the core compute and storage there. And so, we felt that was deserving of more investment because once we get there, we get more scalability, we can do more of the verticalization that was referred to, we can do -- we can better meet local requirements in international markets. And so it\u2019s just for a variety of reasons a really important migration. It won\u2019t be completed this year, but it -- we will really get going in a material way here in fiscal \u201824. So, those are all areas for incremental product investment beyond the self-serve PLG side.\nJake Roberge: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I just wanted to double-click on the product bundles performing better than expected during the quarter. Can you provide some specific examples of those bundles and which products really stood out in terms of customer adoption?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean, very quickly, we -- I\u2019d say the most successful one, and I alluded to this earlier, was what we call a new co-bundle, so new customer acquisition where we bundled our core e-signature product with a couple of key options, SMS and single sign-on, and we had a baseline services offering to accelerate onboarding. And that was a really nice bundle. Some of our highest value features that we feel are most highly correlated with both customer satisfaction and renewal and getting people off to a good start, really is helpful for renewal as well. So again, that was the most successful, worked really well, and we need to do more of that.\nJake Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nAllan Thygesen: Okay. Just quick, let\u2019s just wrap up here. Thank you all for joining and for your support as we continue to evolve our business. In closing, while this past year was challenging, the changes we\u2019re making are vital to driving our long-term growth and success. I think we delivered a solid finish to the year, and we are prioritizing our investment focus on the areas, which we believe will drive increased value for our customers, employees and shareholders. I\u2019m really excited about the steps we\u2019ve taken to accelerate innovation, improve and diversify our go-to-market and support our vision of smarter, easier and trusted agreements. I look forward to sharing more with all of you as the year progresses. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Allan, for the kind words. I'd like to start off by thanking our employees [Technical Difficulty] execution. We closed out the year strong, and I'm proud to share that we achieved an impressive milestone for the Company, delivering $2.5 billion of revenue for the fiscal year, reflecting 19% growth year-on-year. Our Q4 results were solid, demonstrating the durability in our business model and DocuSign's important position in the broader ecosystem. While we are pleased with our results and execution in Q4, we continue to experience a challenging macro environment with softening demand trends, including moderating expansion rates. However, we are seeing healthy results as customers recognize that DocuSign offers high ROI applications that are easy to use, efficient and cost effective. With that, let me turn to our Q4 and fiscal \u201823 results. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $660 million, and subscription revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $644 million. Total revenue for the year reached $2.5 billion, a 19% increase over last year and subscription revenue was $2.4 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase. Our international revenue grew 19% year-over-year to reach $165 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, international revenue grew 29% to $260 million, representing 25% of total revenue for both periods. Fourth quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $739 million. For the full year, billings increased 13% to $2.7 billion. We added approximately 30,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total installed base to $1.36 million at the end of the year, a 16% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 9,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 211,000, a 24% year-over-year increase. We also saw a 27% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,080 customers. Dollar net retention was 107% for the quarter. The headwinds we've highlighted over the last couple of quarters continued to persist. And as a result, we are seeing muted growth in our expansion rates. We expect this to continue into Q1, and as a result, would expect the dollar net retention in Q1 to trend lower. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 83% compared with 81% a year ago. For the full year, gross margin was 82%, in line with last quarter. Fourth quarter subscription gross margin was 85%, consistent with last year. For the full year, subscription gross margin was also 85%, flat versus prior years. Q4 non-GAAP operating income reached $155 million compared with $104 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24% compared to 18% last year. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income rose 23% to $570 million and operating margin was 21% versus 20% in fiscal 2022. In Q4, we saw lower expenses for employee-related costs related to the workforce reduction announced in September, which contributed to the strong operating margin in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 was $133 million compared with $100 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, non-GAAP net income was $419 million, up from $411 million in fiscal \u201822, a growth rate of 2% year-over-year. As noted on our Q1 call last year, we introduced a non-GAAP tax rate on our non-GAAP net income calculation for fiscal \u201823 as we reached consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior three years. We are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal \u201824. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.65, while full year non-GAAP EPS was $2.03. Let me take this opportunity to share a bit more context regarding the recent restructuring. As Allan mentioned, this was a difficult decision and one not made lightly, but it was an important decision aligned with our strategy to reshape the Company and free up resources to invest in critical areas across our innovation and product development efforts. As we outlined in the filing last month, we expect to incur related restructuring charges ranging from $25 million to $35 million, with the majority of the expenses and related cash to be incurred in Q1 of this year, with the restructuring substantially completed by the end of the second quarter. We ended Q4 with 7,336 employees compared to 7,461 last year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 56% year-over-year to $137 million, representing a 21% margin. This compares with $88 million, a 15% margin in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was $113 million, a 17% margin compared to $70 million, a 12% margin in the year prior, a 61% increase year-over-year. As we mentioned on our last call, we went live with a new ERP in Q3 which delayed some of our cash collections last quarter. As a result, we saw strong cash collections this quarter in addition to lower restructuring cash payments on a relative basis. For the full year, operating cash flow was $507 million, representing a 20% margin compared to $506 million, a 24% margin a year ago. Free cash flow declined 4% year-over-year to $429 million, a 17% margin compared to $445 million, a 21% margin to fiscal 2022. We exited Q4 with more than $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. With that, let me turn to our Q1 and fiscal \u201824 guidance. As a reminder, on our Q3 earnings call, we provided a preliminary outlook for fiscal \u201824. We are pleased to narrow the preliminary range we provided, incorporating our Q4 landing and the dynamics of the current environment into our guidance. We anticipate the macro environment will remain challenging as we move through the year. And as Allan mentioned, we may also see modest near-term disruption as we realign our sales force and shift to more of a self-serve motion. For the first quarter and fiscal year \u201824, we anticipate total revenue of $639 million to $643 million in Q1 or growth of 9% year-over-year. And $2.695 billion to $2.707 billion for fiscal \u201824 or growth of 7% to 8% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $625 million to $629 million in Q1 or growth of 10% to 11% year-over-year. And $2.633 billion to $2.645 billion for fiscal \u201824 or growth of 8% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $615 million to $625 million in Q1 or flat to 2% growth year-over-year and $2.705 billion to $2.725 billion for fiscal \u201824 or growth of 2% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both, Q1 and the fiscal year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 21% to 22% for Q1 and 21% to 23% for fiscal \u201824. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $207 million to $212 million for both Q1 and fiscal \u201824. Fiscal \u201823 was a year of transition, and we are pleased with our execution and the progress we are making as we navigate a challenging macro environment. We remain committed to delivering sustainable growth and profitability at scale, and we will continue to be disciplined with our investments across strategic priorities. We are focused on delivering long-term value to our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the steps we are taking and look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. The journey to $2.5 billion has been hard work and a testament to the compelling value proposition DocuSign brings to our customers. Together, we have played an important role in how the world agrees. I look forward to the future. And finally, I'll be here a little while longer, as Allan said, so no goodbye's for now. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator? Thanks, Brad. Yes. So, I think on the expansion rate, I think it's a continuing trend that we've been talking about from -- over the last few quarters, which is, as the book of business has grown and the macro environment has softened, the rate at which customers are expanding is slowing. So that growth rate and expansion is slowing. And so, I would say, there wasn't a big change in Q4 relative to the couple of quarters before but it is a continuing trend that's putting some pressure on the top line. On the cohorts, we actually do, do a lot of analysis on the cohorts. And I would say some of the cohorts are probably expanding at a slower rate and some are moderating the rate at which they're expanding. But I'd say overall, it's having the same impact. And part of it is, as we've talked about in past quarters, is a little bit of a law of large numbers as that book of business gets bigger, you need more and more expansion dollars to move in. And so customers are still expanding. But when you look at the top line, that's probably the biggest factor kind of impacting the compression of some of those growth rates. I'll take the billings question. But before I do that, I realize I misspoke on international revenue. So just to clarify, international revenue grew 29% to $620 million. I think I said $250 million, just a clarification there. On the billings question, I think it's related to a couple of things. One is, as we talked about last quarter, we're expecting a slower start to the year. I think when you look at the macro environment, we certainly haven't gotten better and you could probably sense just maybe gotten a little bit worse. And on top of that, we have made some changes to the fields, which we think could cause some disruption. So I think that's certainly playing into both the revenue and the billings guide we're giving to the year. I'd also say we always guide to what we can see. I think we can see Q1 better than we can see the rest of the year. But given the 1% guide in Q1, we would expect that to kind of improve as we move through the year and some of the investments we may start to take hold. So I think those are some of the dynamics kind of... Thanks for the question. So to be clear, in the outlook we provided, the most recent restructuring was not factored [Technical Difficulty] we were evaluating the scenarios for this fiscal year as part of our annual plan in areas that we want to invest in across the strategic priorities. But that wasn't contemplated specifically at the time or baked into the outlook we provided. That being said, I think as we went through the process of the annual [Technical Difficulty] it was clear that we needed more room for investment across the key priorities. And as Allan articulated, the plan is to invest in R&D in particular and innovation and kind of shift some of the investments into that initiative as well as PLG self-serve. So, we were able to come a little bit above the outlook we provided. If you remember in Q3 on margin, we said at the low end of our long-term target range, which is 20% to 22%, the long-term target range as a reminder, is 20% to 25%, and our guide for the year is 21% to 23%. So, we are going to be reinvesting, but we also increased the margin by a little bit. Sure. Yes. So I totally understand the question. I would say Q4, the 24% margin was higher than probably what our steady rate is for a couple of reasons. One is we had just gone through the fall restructuring. So that really dropped to margin. And then, in addition, the hiring in Q4 was slower than we had anticipated in the quarter. So as we kind of look into this year, we see the opportunity in front of us, and we want to invest into the key pillars of the strategic priorities that Allan talked about, right, in the product, in innovation and then in PLG self-serve. And so, we're really putting that money from the second restructuring back into the business to really level set against those key areas. One thing I would just add on the SMB, we could see -- we did see some relative strength there relative -- across our business. And we ran some experiments in Q4, particularly around the bundles or around increasing number of seats. So, we did see kind of a higher volume of SMB deals at lower price points. So, higher volume, lower price, which we thought, especially like in NewCo was a positive sign, as Allan mentioned. So just a little bit more color there."

            "name": "Allan Thygesen",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter marked my first full quarter as DocuSign's CEO. Having led our organization for five months with the opportunity to meet many of our customers, partners and employees, I'm even more optimistic today about the future of DocuSign. We had a solid finish to a transitional year, delivering across key financial metrics in Q4 while making tangible progress against our key priorities. Q4 total revenue came in at $660 million, up 14% versus prior year, finishing the year with $2.5 billion of revenue and 19% year-on-year growth. Driven by our continued focus on profitability and efficiency, we reported 24% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter and 21% for the year. While we are pleased with our Q4 results, I also want to acknowledge today's challenging macro environment. Customer sentiment continues to be cautious, and that is reflected in moderated expansion rates. Before we get further into business updates, I want to acknowledge today's news that Cynthia Gaylor has decided to step down from her role as Chief Financial Officer. Cynthia has been with DocuSign for nearly 4.5 years, first as a Board member and Chair of our Audit Committee and last few years as our CFO. I know many of you know Cynthia well and gotten to know her even better over time as part of the DocuSign story. I want to thank Cynthia for her unwavering commitment and strategic leadership these last few years. She's been a great partner to me during my first month as CEO, and she's been instrumental to the company and the Board as we've navigated a period of dynamic change while laying a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth at scale. I thank her for her support during the transition as we search for a successor. Let me turn back to the business. During Q4, we refined and communicated DocuSign strategy throughout our organization to drive greater alignment on how our teams can deliver more strategic value to our customers. Today, we have a clearly defined strategy in place. To underscore the key pillars of our strategic vision, inspired by customer feedback, our focus is to deliver smarter, easier and trusted agreements. We're improving the reach and efficiency of our go-to-market by developing a world-class self-serve experience, strengthening our direct sales productivity and amplifying our sales and marketing partnerships. We're also strengthening our internal operational efficiency by optimizing and modernizing systems and processes. Now, it's important to emphasize that even as the market leader in e-signature, we are just at the beginning of capitalizing on the opportunities to redefine and truly reimagine what a smarter agreement looks like. Today eSign provides an online replica of a static document. While that is a huge improvement in convenience and productivity for senders and signers, it's hardly the endpoint. Just like creating digital copies of maps or recorded music was the beginning of a reimagination of long-established categories, fundamentally altering creation, distribution and use. Our goal is to turn flat agreements into structured data that can be used to make intelligent decisions. Value of an agreement is in the data. Every step of an agreement can deliver more value when it's automated, intelligent and seamlessly integrated into core business systems. DocuSign is uniquely positioned to redefine the agreement processes across every industry. Along these lines, we released several new product enhancements during the fourth quarter, including expanded integrations to better collaborate with Microsoft Teams, Slack and Zoom. And for eSignature, we enabled new AI-assisted document highlighting and signing capabilities in mobile and web for faster time to value. In April, we will release WebForms which will help customers deliver a better and simpler experience by moving from legacy contract forms to a modern web and app experience. We also plan to accelerate our release cycles in fiscal 2024 with innovative and differentiated solutions that simplify the agreement process, while we identify new ways to revolutionize how businesses initiate, negotiate and manage agreements. There's substantial interest in the industry about rapid advances in AI and large language models in particular. We are already leveraging sophisticated AI models for contract analysis and automation of some workflows, and we're very excited to harness generative AI, data and pattern identification, as yet another way we can increase productivity, reduce friction and save our customers' time. As we move forward, we believe these can be a compelling part of our business, and we are encouraged by the significant interest from some of the very largest players in our industry, who recognize our domain leadership and expertise and want to partner with us. Moving to our product led growth and self-serve initiatives. We've made solid progress over the last few months, modernizing our commerce experience to reduce friction, improve ease of use and provide customers more flexibility. We've expanded seat capacity available via our web and mobile sites, we've expanded currency options available to make the buying process easier in international markets. Gain traction with these initiatives as we exited the quarter, and we will continue to keep you updated on our progress. Further, as you saw in an announcement a few weeks ago, I couldn't be more excited to have Robert Chatwani, joining our team as President and General Manager of Growth. Robert brings a wealth of experience, and we look forward to benefiting from his insights and expertise for more than two decades of scaling global technology companies. He joins DocuSign from an organization that's broadly recognized as having a world-class product-led growth motion. Executing on our product growth strategy is a key priority for the company as it will be a primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion and expansion. I'm thrilled to have Robert leading our efforts in this area. Turning to our go-to-market. We're just coming off our global sales kickoff last week, and I can tell you that the sales team is incredibly excited and energized for the year ahead. We're focused on delivering across three complementary channels: direct, self-serve and partners, and to provide world-class customer success in driving customer growth and retention through all three. As an example of global growth and multiproduct expansion, this past quarter, a leading global consulting firm, who has been using eSignature for a decade, expanded and added our CLM cost product. This is a competitive sales cycle since the customer is already in the process of implementing a competitor CLM solution in a few countries. However, DocuSign won preferred vendor status for CLM and the customer has since rolled us out in six countries across two continents and has built integrations with their internal systems and the DocuSign partners Salesforce and ServiceNow. Related to go-to-market, I want to acknowledge the restructuring we recently announced. It was a difficult decision but it was a critically important step for our company to reshape and rightsize our organization for the opportunity ahead. It was not a broad-based restructuring. 95% of the workforce reduction was in our worldwide field organization. Our assessment was that DocuSign could capture more efficiency in our overall go-to-market across all segments and that we could unlock more profitable growth by investing part of the savings in product development and innovation. Now, the direct channel remains absolutely critical to our future. We are rebalancing our approach towards offering a lighter touch experience with more self-serve capabilities that give customers of all sizes, choice in how they engage with DocuSign. That pivot in turn frees up resources to invest more in our self-service motion and expanded road map for agreement workflows, new AI capabilities, accelerating our migration to the cloud and improving our internal systems. That, in turn, will create an even stronger and more valuable offering for our customers and for our sales team to sell. Still have some work to do to strengthen our self-serve experience over the next 6 to 12 months. And while we may see some modest near-term disruption, we're confident these are the right steps, going forward to drive innovation and growth for our customers for the long term. Additionally, a stronger self-serve motion will enable greater expansion opportunities internationally. Turning to our internal operations and processes, Anwar Akram recently joined as our Chief Operating Officer and will play a crucial role within our organization. Anwar's focus is to bring together and transform our strategy, develop new strategies around pricing and packaging, driving incremental efficiencies internally and help evolve early-stage ideas into future growth initiatives. Related to these efforts, I noted on the last call, that we rolled out product bundles to introduce more features and functionalities to our customers. I'm pleased to share that these bundled promotions performed better than expected, and we saw good adoption for our new SMB customers in particular. Our experience suggests that customers that adopt a broader set of features, renew and expand their commitment with us. You should expect to see more initiatives around pricing and packaging in the future, including bundling and ensuring early adoption of our highest value features. Finally, I would like to update you on our partner ecosystem, another key pillar of our strategy. We're seeing good progress with a number of our largest software partners. ServiceNow is a good example, highlighted by the launch of the CLM Spoke as part of ServiceNow's automation engine. Our partnership has gained momentum with several leading organizations utilizing our integration to digitize their agreements. This is directly aligned with our focus on capturing opportunities by integrating more deeply with partner applications. So, in closing, this year has been one of incredible change for DocuSign. And in Q4, we made meaningful strides towards defining our strategy, rightsizing and optimizing our organization. We believe the foundation has been set and that we are in a better position to navigate the evolving macro environment while investing for opportunities that enable long-term profitable growth. We're optimistic about the year ahead for DocuSign, and we're committed to delivering meaningful customer and shareholder value. We look forward to sharing further progress on our initiatives as we redefine how the world comes together and agrees. We will enable smarter, easier and trusted agreements. With that, let me once again thank Cynthia and turn the call over to her to walk through the financials. Cynthia? I'll go first. Thanks, Brent. I think on the sales force, so I'd say, I think we are in a significantly more stable situation than 6, 12 months ago. Attrition rates have slowed. We've got, I think, a pretty full team in place. Steve has done a very nice job with that. There's more better execution, better predictability. Part of what gave us the confidence to take the restructuring action was in fact that and that we could see what our sales capacity was, and we felt we had a little bit of excess capacity there as well as a keen understanding of where we could deinvest and free up resources to invest elsewhere. So, we're being cautious in saying there could be a little bit of disruption as some of the -- particularly the very low end, some of the business that might previously have had a little bit of human touch, we'll try to do that more particularly through our self-serve motion. But I think that should play out in a relatively very quick order over 1 to 2 quarters. But I think the sales force is actually in the best place it's been for a while. We just had our global kickoff last week in I think I'm presenting them saying that they're incredibly energized by the road map. And they all have slightly larger territories, now too. So, it's a very positive feel I think, throughout the sales team. Yes. Thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is the overall macro environment just affects businesses of all sizes and their ability and willingness to spend on all kinds of software, including ours. But I don't think we're particularly more macro sensitive or a little less than others. In terms of the industry mix in the economy, we do have a little bit of over exposure, if you will, to real estate and a few other sectors that have been a little tougher. On the other hand, we are quite diversified and have some real strength in sectors like health and manufacturing, telecommunications. So that's balancing out. In terms of the value prop, I agree with your statement. I think there's a very quick payback. I think we're seeing that. So customers -- and that's also a key part of DocuSign's competitive value proposition vis-a\u0300-vis other competitors, people tend to respond fast. They're more likely to respond to an agreement. They're more -- they're faster to respond and they have a better positive experience. So overall, I think the macro environment presents some clouds for IT budgets of companies of all sizes. We are seeing maybe a little bit more vertical exposure than the average company but are generally pretty balanced. And I think our value prop remains quite strong. Yes. I'll take the first one. So, just our go-to-market, historically, DocuSign has been very heavily focused on a direct sales motion for customers of all sizes. And we will retain direct sales as our principal go-to-market channel, and it's a huge strength for the Company, and we certainly want to continue to improve there. But we feel we want to complement it in two areas. One is with the self-serve motion. And that's not just for little customers. That's for customers of all sizes. We just think that all customers appreciate an opportunity to self-serve for certain types of activities at all stages of their journey with us. And that -- I'll come back to that in a second. And then third, we are really focused on maturing our partner go-to-market where we can use distributors and resellers in some international markets, we can partner with ISVs to be directly embedded in their applications. We have significant activity there, what can meaningfully improve. Let me quickly return to the self-serve piece in particular. I want to make sure that it's clear, we want to stop treating digital and direct sales as separate channels over time. We essentially want to offer all customers the opportunity to self-serve if and when they wish. And I expect many customers will avail themselves of that. And then as a corollary, I want our sales teams to see the self-serve options as a positive complement to their activities. I think that's what we did at Google, I think that's Robert did at Atlassian, and I think that's what a lot of companies that are natively digital in their motion do, and I think we have a tremendous amount of opportunity there. So that's our overall go-to-market plan. Cynthia, do you want to take the second half? Yes. So first of all, on a segment basis, and I think Cynthia alluded to this, we have first of all, a very balanced customer portfolio. So, we have a significant SMB and mid-market business and a big emphasis on growing our enterprise business. And I'd say on balance, I don't know that there's a huge difference in momentum between those sectors. I know some companies are reporting particular challenges in SMB. I don't think we're seeing that. In fact, we had some nice momentum on new accounts in particular. So, I was pleased to see that. I think in terms of -- that was the segment piece. What was the other part of your question? Okay. There's no question that over the last three to five years, the market has gotten more competitive. I don't know that we're seeing a material change in how competitive it is here in the last few quarters. I think we continue to be the market leader. We don't spend as much time worrying about what other people are doing, I think we want to really redefine the category and set the direction for the industry. And I think we're well on our way to doing that. And that's where we're focused from a competitive standpoint, if you will. In terms of the tactics, we are looking on pricing and packaging and how can we be as agile as possible by segment, by country. There might be a few countries where we've gotten a little too far off the market. And so, we're looking at that very carefully. I mentioned some bundling opportunities during my prepared remarks. So, we think there's a lot of opportunities there. There's some enterprise license agreements. Some of our largest customers, we really want to the ubiquitous eSignature solution for -- in every instance where they want to deploy that. And so we're in the process of both building out the product to enable that for embedding as well as direct sales and in structuring our license agreements so that that is as attractive as possible for our large clients. Yes. Actually, I think WebForms has a little bit more potential than that. We're very optimistic because I think it really -- it epitomizes the transformation of agreement with sort of a static representation of a traditional form to completely new customer experiences. And the other thing it does, of course, is it makes it much easier to capture all the meta data around the agreements, which is really where we're heading in the longer term. As you think about what we want to do is we want to decompose agreements into dynamic objects that can be filled both with data from the customer side and from the signer side. And WebForms is the first step of that process. There's a lot more coming in the remainder of the year along those lines. So, we're quite bullish on the cumulative impact of all of those launches. But obviously, version 1.0 will have some gaps. In terms of the transformational piece, I think I touched a little on the AI piece. I -- we have a lot of opportunity there. And so, we have some -- we will be making some announcements on that later this spring, as the beginning of a new product in that area. And over time, I think the work that we're doing now to completely revamp how we leverage AI is very exciting. So, if you think about the application of AI in the agreement space, a lot of the excitement right now around ChatGPT and the other -- and the competitors are around basically text generation, and that has an obvious analogy to the agreement space of drafting contracts. And we do think that's very exciting and that there's value to be captured there, and we will absolutely pursue that. But, if you look at where companies actually find value from agreements, it would be more in the extraction of data and value out of the agreements as well as the search and analytics on that. And you can also apply AI to that. And that's an area where I think we are uniquely positioned to deliver very compelling value, and we got a number of large customers who are very excited to work with us on that type of next-generation AI activity. I don't think -- that's not going to hit in the next couple of quarters. But in terms of the longer-term road map and delivering on our vision, it's incredibly exciting and could really provide transformational growth. Yes. So, first of all, I think, look, when people first hear self-serve, they think of don't you already have a website and can't people order on your website. And of course, yes, we do, and yes, they can. But what I'm talking about is a significantly more transformational effort where customers can discover, try, embrace and really deploy products without ever engaging with a DocuSign employee, and we can then engage with them as that potential is demonstrated and expressed and we can apply our sales forces really more efficiently. So, it becomes a huge multiplier for efficiency in our sales teams. And that's the model that companies like Atlassian has had pioneered over time and very excited to apply that at DocuSign. In terms of how that applies across segments, it's certainly true that you can imagine an SMB customer basically remaining a purely digital customer, and we would love that. But as customers grow in scope and potential and complexity, then the application of those sales resources becomes both more profitable for us and more necessary for the customer. And so, I do expect a heavier sales component as we -- as you move up market. Mid-market has always been a core strength for us and it remains a really important segment. A lot of our products -- you start there and you sort of grow out from there. So, I think that will remain a critical segment for DocuSign and very relevant for the self-serve -- expanded self-serve motion that I've just described. Yes. We are in active discussions internally exactly how we want to pursue Japan. I'd say Germany is another market where I don't think we have fully lived up to our potential. And I agree with you, we're in a great starting position. Our initial forays into both of those markets were really mostly just a direct sales motion. We didn't put, I think, quite enough resources behind it and all the other functions, including product and our administrative functions. And as you noted, in markets like Japan, the road is littered with U.S. companies that have tried to go to Japan. So we're certainly going to be leveraging partners there. So stay tuned. I think we'll have more to report on both of those countries during the course of fiscal \u201824. But right now, it's sort of in the planning and decisioning exactly how we're going to pursue that. But those are definitely strategic priorities within our broader international strategy. Yes. I'd say, first of all, we feel like we have turned the organization pretty well at this point and reallocated resources to where we'd see the highest investment. Look, I agree with you. I think we were not sufficiently efficient from a sales and marketing perspective. I hope to make us more efficient over time. Until I see that, I don't -- we don't want to be -- as Cynthia says, we want to project what we see. And -- but you can assume that there will be a lot of emphasis on getting increasingly efficient, even beyond what we have, but I'm not ready to make any -- that part of our forecast at this time. But that would certainly be the hope and expectation that we can accelerate top line and improve efficiency over time. I would say maybe one other point on the investment piece. We feel we have a very significant opportunity. And we have been, I think, a little underinvested in innovation over the last couple of years. We had the -- and have the market-leading product and it remains an incredible value proposition. But I'm excited to reinvigorate that and get us to capitalize on the larger opportunity that I outlined earlier on this call. And I think the whole team feels -- we already got some stuff coming out in Q1, and there will be a lot more over the next three quarters, and that will position us to -- for growth in future years. Yes. I think change and transition for calendar \u201822 -- fiscal \u201823. For this year, I think it's about setting the foundations for growth, and we are -- we're really leaning into that. I think we have a fantastic opportunity to capitalize on this very large TAM that we believe were pointed at. We are the market leader in e-signature and CLM. We are in the best position to capitalize on that opportunity, and we just need to go execute. So, that's the job this year. It's not quite as much of a turnaround transitional year as last year, it's much more of a foundation and preparation for growth building year. Yes. I mean, I think we've reported in the past that 13% of our business is digital. But a lot of that is associated by the fact that there's only a small number of profits and options that you can find on our website. And so, we've been pushing actively even relative to small customers to have to order from a sales rep which I will admit I was slightly shocked to learn when I joined. So, our goal is to dramatically grow the -- all the pieces of the business. And I'm not sure it's going to be as meaningful a year from now to talk about what's digital versus what's direct because -- in a lot of cases, our customer may order some things digitally and may talk to their sales rep about other things. And so, the whole thing becomes a little bit less clear. From a partner perspective, I don't think we've externally reported in our partner mix. It's a partner touched, it's a meaningful minority of our business, in terms of directly partners sold, that's a little smaller. I think both of those need to grow meaningfully. We don't have -- I alluded to this in my comments, just as one example. There's a big opportunity to embed our market-leading signature agreement workflow products directly into third-party products. We do some of that today, but we're not set up well to serve developers today. So we've got a couple of quarters of work to do to really provide a world-class set of componentized tools that allow developers to pick and choose from all the things we have to create the most compelling agreement experiences inside of their products. That's going to be a really important growth driver. But I'm not going at this time to comment on the exact magnitude. Yes. It's a great question. I would say we're at the earlier phases of our verticalization strategy. We've long had a special suite of tools for the real estate industry. I think they are best-in-class and we'll continue to tweak and improve on that. More recently, we've done some, I think, really nice work, for example, in the healthcare space, where we've added some compliance with a variety of federal regulations that enables our products to be used for healthcare applications, and that's driven some really nice growth. I think we have opportunities and this is an active part of our product planning to basically have our products sufficiently componentized that we can easily create custom workflows that are tailored to individual industries. So, I mean, obvious example, if you have something for mortgages, it's not that different from a loan application, it's not that different from an automotive car purchase. And those are all sectors that we already have business in and where I think we have opportunities to create deeper vertical agreements. Another example is government. And so, we have big opportunities in the government space as well. But I'd say we're -- we've got some work to do to really fully capitalize on the verticalization opportunity that you alluded to, which I totally agree with. It's really across all of those. So, we are absolutely directing investment dollars towards accelerating our product like growth motion, and so that absolutely. But in addition to that, we direct additional investment dollars into accelerating our agreement workflow road map into the CLM space and into our cloud migration. I think many of you are aware that we're in the process of migrating our suite to Microsoft Azure, a very strong relationship with Microsoft. And this is a really important year for that migration to move some of the core workloads and some of the core compute and storage there. And so, we felt that was deserving of more investment because once we get there, we get more scalability, we can do more of the verticalization that was referred to, we can do -- we can better meet local requirements in international markets. And so it's just for a variety of reasons a really important migration. It won't be completed this year, but it -- we will really get going in a material way here in fiscal \u201824. So, those are all areas for incremental product investment beyond the self-serve PLG side. Yes. I mean, very quickly, we -- I'd say the most successful one, and I alluded to this earlier, was what we call a new co-bundle, so new customer acquisition where we bundled our core e-signature product with a couple of key options, SMS and single sign-on, and we had a baseline services offering to accelerate onboarding. And that was a really nice bundle. Some of our highest value features that we feel are most highly correlated with both customer satisfaction and renewal and getting people off to a good start, really is helpful for renewal as well. So again, that was the most successful, worked really well, and we need to do more of that. Okay. Just quick, let's just wrap up here. Thank you all for joining and for your support as we continue to evolve our business. In closing, while this past year was challenging, the changes we're making are vital to driving our long-term growth and success. I think we delivered a solid finish to the year, and we are prioritizing our investment focus on the areas, which we believe will drive increased value for our customers, employees and shareholders. I'm really excited about the steps we've taken to accelerate innovation, improve and diversify our go-to-market and support our vision of smarter, easier and trusted agreements. I look forward to sharing more with all of you as the year progresses. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of the website following the call. [Operator Instructions] I will now pass the call over to Heather Harwood, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHeather Harwood: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to the DocuSign Q3 2023 earnings call. I am Heather Harwood, DocuSign\u2019s Head of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today are DocuSign\u2019s CEO, Allan Thygesen; and our CFO, Cynthia Gaylor.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to be here for my first earnings call as DocuSign's CEO. I'd like to begin by thanking Maggie Wilderotter for leading the team as Interim CEO. Maggie set the stage for a smooth and seamless transition, and we're grateful to her for her leadership and for her continued stewardship as our Board Chair. There are three main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. First, we delivered solid third quarter results, exceeding the key operating metrics we laid out last quarter despite the continued macro headwinds. Our results are a reflection, I think, of the continued signs of stabilization across the business. I'd like to commend our team for their unwavering commitment despite the considerable distraction. Second, as the global leader in the eSignature category, DocuSign is expanding across broader agreement related workflows. We have challenges to address, but we have an exceptionally strong foundation and meaningful competitive advantage, which leads me to my third point. I believe our future is bright. Along with the team, I'm personally energized by the opportunity and the work that lies ahead. I'm confident in our progress, and I believe we are unequivocally well-positioned for the long-term. Now before I move on to discuss the future of our business, I want to share what compelled me to join DocuSign. I followed the company for many years, and like our over 1 billion users, I find our value proposition distinctive and invaluable. We've built a powerful brand that's recognized by decision-makers well before we even engage with them. That combination of affinity that DocuSign has with customers and users, and our untapped market potential is very rare in the enterprise software space. DocuSign created and built the eSignature category, yet agreement process are still at the early stages of moving from pen to paper to more automated ways of working. In fact, I believe we're just at the beginning of revolutionizing how businesses initiate, negotiate and manage agreements, and we will leave that as we did for e-Signature. We provide solutions for customers of all sizes, industries and functions. During my almost 12 years at Google, I first led the global SMB and mid-market business, and then the enterprise business in the Americas, including managing our relationships with our largest global partners. I've experienced firsthand how exceptionally powerful a broad, diversified customer base can be, and I'm excited to bring that experience to DocuSign. For my first 60 days, I've focused on gaining a deeper understanding of our business, meeting with employees across the company as well as spending time with customers and partners. Through these conversations, I've started to identify some critical areas in which we can improve to strengthen our value proposition in addition to scaling the business by streamlining and creating efficiencies. I continue to see customers embrace and expand with our core eSignature offering. For example, this past quarter, one of the UK's largest health care providers expanded their use of e-Signature. They began the journey as a customer during the pandemic, and they've now migrated their entire patient onboarding process and adopted our products across their HR, legal, joint ventures and other departments. Key criteria in the recent competitive selection process, included privacy and security of their customer data, and the ability to utilize the advanced workflow features we offer. Notwithstanding our considerable strengths, I believe it's important to acknowledge where we have not executed as well. It's clear we did not pivot quickly enough and we were slow to make changes. As we experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic, we did not scale the team properly. We lost some innovation velocity. We didn't fully address the changing market dynamics nor mature our operations and systems sufficiently. We understand those gaps, and we're committed to moving forward with more transparency. I think the good news is that the future is in our own hands. So let me turn to our focus going forward. We are committed to broadening the category. That starts with a more clearly defined product road map that leverages our core eSignature strength and our ambition of delivering easier, smarter, trusted agreements. We see opportunities beyond the replacement of paper signatures to deliver innovative new experiences and integrate more deeply with partner applications. If you think about it, many use cases don't require editing or completion of the static, unstructured, highly formatted traditional agreement. Instead, I think data capture for agreements should happen through digital forms on the web or in an app. The agreements themselves should be dynamically generated, and the metadata should be automatically captured to enable personalization for future interactions. With our new web forms offering, which is currently in early beta, we're enabling our customers to transition from a PDF-centric experience to guided web-native experiences. We're also continuing to innovate on the CLM front, further solidifying our vision, customer validation and execution within the CLM space. Most recently, DocuSign was named the leader in the Gartner 2022 Magic Quadrant for CLM for the third consecutive year. We are placed highest of all vendors on the ability to execute access and second highest on the completeness of vision access. These products directly support each other. We're encouraged by how existing eSignature customers continue to embrace our CLM capabilities to enhance and speed their workflows. For example, this past quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of the largest ride-sharing organizations. Our team identified key areas of expansion using our Signature and CLM product to support their evolving business needs. They expanded their eSignature footprint and are now more streamlined in their internal processes, thanks to our CLM offering. Over the next few quarters, we'll expand our work here and augment the road map to broaden the power of managing workflows throughout the agreement life cycle. While we're not seeing dramatic shifts recently in the competitive landscape, it is important to recognize that today's market is more competitive, particularly for the basic sign use cases, which further highlights the importance of an innovative and differentiated product portfolio like DocuSign's. I want to touch on our plans to improve operations and sales productivity. While we are continuing to lead with innovation, we are staying hyper-focused on making the customer experience more seamless and integrated, particularly with our go-to-market motion. I think that starts with bolstering our self-service mill initiatives. I was deeply involved in enabling self-serving for every stage of the order cycle for customers at -- of all sizes at Google, and I know the power of a frictionless experience. I'm confident we can achieve both improved customer experiences and greater go-to-market efficiency as we move in this direction. We already have over 1 million customers who self-serve. The inbound traffic to our website continues to grow, and we have a highly recognized and trusted brand. So we have a lot to work with. We also want to create stronger efficiencies in our direct sales and field efforts and strengthen our partner ecosystem. So I'm pleased that sales attrition is continuing to moderate, and we're seeing stabilization in the field. Moving forward, we're focused on improving funnel conversion, consolidating and streamlining our teams, strengthening our focus on customer success and retention and implementing new incentive structures, all with the goal of driving efficiency and accountability. We're also leaning in on simplifying our pricing and packaging strategy, recently began rolling out new product bundles to enable customers to more easily access useful and differentiated productivity features, which in turn further the customer ROI and improve retention and being the customer a richer experience. We know that customers who use more than three features are more likely to expand their footprint with us, and that will be critical for more profitable growth at scale. We already have an industry-leading partner ecosystem. This represents a significant opportunity to expand customer value and distribution reach through our network of ISVs, resellers, system integrators and developers. By reimagining how we engage that ecosystem, we expect to create a platform that will see stronger revenue contribution from our partners and help unlock and fuel international expansion opportunities in particular. I personally visited customers and teams in four of our key European markets last week, which reaffirmed that one of our most significant growth opportunities, will come from international markets. During the trip, I had the pleasure to meet with one of the world's leading communications carriers. They've been a customer for seven years now. Our account team identified key areas to drive growth with expanded use cases, which accelerated adoption, which in turn led to an early renewal expansion. So we're excited to grow our footprint in their ecosystem as they continue to leverage our products to digitize their customer experience and reduce operating expenses while helping to create a more sustainable future. Lastly, internally, our operational focus has been on streamlining our processes, upgrading our internal systems and modernizing more of our own workflows to improve efficiency and scalability. As an example, we just closed our first quarter on our new ERP system, which has been a key dependency for automating more of our operations. In summary, I believe we're acting with urgency to recalibrate the business and leverage our strong foundation to adapt to the evolving business landscape and the changing and challenging macro environment. These efforts will take time, and they represent a continued evolution for DocuSign. However, I am fully confident that the opportunity is here for DocuSign and is within our reach with a clear strategy, focus and execution. Thank you for your time today. I'm thrilled to be leading DocuSign, and I'm committed to being transparent with all of you about our progress as we move forward. Now, I'll hand it over to Cynthia, who will take you through our Q3 financial results and outlook. Cynthia?\nCynthia Gaylor: Excellent. Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q3 results, delivering on the top and bottom line. We continue to expand our customer base and remain focused on progress against our key priorities as we execute against our long-term strategy. As the macro becomes more challenging, we are seeing softening demand trends materialize, including smaller deal sizes and expansion, with increased customer scrutiny on priorities and budgets in some cases. On the other hand, we are still seeing healthy results as customers recognize DocuSign offers high-ROI applications that are easy to use, efficient and cost-effective. Let me now review our Q3 results. Total revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $645 million, and subscription revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $624 million. The continued strengthening of the US dollar resulted in a couple-point headwind to total revenue growth in the quarter, in line with our previous expectations. The impact was not material to our results. Our international revenue grew 23% year-over-year to reach $157 million in the third quarter, representing 24% of our total revenue. Third quarter billings grew 17% year-over-year to $659 million as our installed base continued to expand. The strength in billings growth was partially driven by early renewals, particularly renewals from Q4. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter billings can fluctuate due to the timing and completion of deals, including timing of renewals and expansions. Customer growth remained strong as we added approximately 42,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total installed base to 1.32 million customers worldwide at the end of Q3, a 19% increase compared to a year ago. This includes the addition of approximately 10,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of $202,000, a 26% increase over last year. We also saw a 34% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,052 customers. These results demonstrate progress against our key initiatives. However, we continue to see the effects of a more challenging macro environment. Real estate and financial service verticals continue to see headwind. So even within these sectors, we see pockets of expansion with customers for specific use cases. Expansion use cases underscore our product differentiation and value for our customers as we continue to invest in innovation around broader agreement workflows. As it relates to verticals, we are also encouraged by relative strength in our manufacturing, retail, business services and technology sectors, highlighting the important benefit of our diversified customer base. And while the global slowdown presented challenges more generally, we saw varying degrees of strength and weakness across all regions and segments. Dollar net retention was 108% for the quarter. We continue to see more muted buying patterns and slower expansion rates from customers in the current climate. We expect buying patterns to remain cautious in the near-term, resulting in dollar net retention continuing to trend downward for the remainder of the year. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 83% compared to 82% last year. Q3 non-GAAP operating profit reached $147 million compared with $122 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% from 22% last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $118 million compared with $121 million in the third quarter of last year. As noted on our Q1 call this year, we introduced a non-GAAP tax rate within our non-GAAP net income calculation as we reached consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior three years. We're using a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for fiscal 2023. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. In September, we announced a restructuring plan, which included a workforce reduction in response to the changing environment. This was not an easy decision, but was an important step for the health of the business. Our GAAP results include $28 million in Q3 restructuring-related expenses as we take a long-term view of the opportunity ahead, we will evaluate the best ways to reinvest capital into areas that accelerate initiatives and present the strongest return. We are committed to making progress in a sustainable way towards our long-term target margin. We ended Q3 with 7,522 employees compared to 7,056 last year. The restructuring process is well underway, and we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal year. The workforce reductions, coupled with more disciplined spending and cost containment throughout the company, drove strong Q3 non-GAAP operating margin. While we are pleased with the Q3 margin, we delayed some spend in the quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate the most critical areas for investment. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $53 million, representing an 8% margin. Free cash flow was $36 million or a 6% margin. As we mentioned on our Q2 earnings call, during the third quarter, we implemented a new ERP, a foundational system for our company. The go-live was successful, with smooth implementation and no material disruptions to our core processes. As noted on our last call, the timing of cash collections and payments were impacted by the ERP transition as we anticipated, and some were pushed from Q3 to Q4. We also incurred one-time cash expenses in Q3 related to the restructuring. On a more normalized basis, excluding the impact from the restructuring and our ERP implementation, our operating cash flow margin would have been approximately 14%, and our free cash flow margin would have been approximately 12%. This compares with operating cash flow of $105 million or a 19% margin and free cash flow of $90 million or 17% margin for the same period last year. We expect lower restructuring cash payments to benefit fourth quarter cash flows relative to Q3. We exited Q3 with more than $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Turning to our share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 740,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $38 million, which demonstrates our confidence in the durability of our business and in the opportunities ahead. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately $137 million in remaining buyback capacity. We remain committed to opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to our Q4 and fiscal '23 guidance. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year '23, we anticipate total revenue of $637 million to $641 million in Q4 or a growth of 10% year-over-year and $2.493 billion to $2.497 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $624 million to $628 million in Q4 or growth of 11% year-over-year and $2.423 billion to $2.427 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 19% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $705 million to $715 million in Q4 or growth of 5% to 7% year-over-year and $2.626 billion to $2.636 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 11% to 12% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 82% to 83% for Q4 and 81% to 82% for fiscal '23. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 20% to 22% for Q4 and 18% to 20% for fiscal '23. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for both Q4 and fiscal '23. Looking ahead, we are in the early stages of planning for next year and focused on executing across our critical priorities to finish the year strong. While we will not be formally providing guidance for next year, we would like to share a preliminary outlook for fiscal '24 informed by what we are seeing across the business and in the broader macro environment. We currently expect a slower start to the fiscal year. For total revenue, we would expect high single-digit growth during fiscal '24. For billings, we would expect low single-digit growth for next year. We're committed to maintaining our disciplined approach to expenses, carefully addressing and prioritizing strategic investments that will drive our sustainable growth at scale. As a result, we expect to operate at the lower end of our long-term target operating margin range of 20% to 25% in fiscal '24. In closing, we delivered a solid Q3 despite a challenging operating environment. To drive growth, we'll continue to invest thoughtfully and closely monitor the returns on our investments, pivot as needed and evaluate opportunities to drive growth, efficiency and profitability at scale. Our Q3 results are a meaningful indicator of the strength of our business and the customer value proposition we deliver, that allows us to delight our customers in a meaningful way. We are thrilled to welcome Allan to DocuSign and want to take a moment to also thank our team for their exceptional work and focus during this time of transition. While we know it will take time for our progress to be fully reflected in our financial results, we are committed to advancing the business and executing against our long-term strategy, while delivering sustainable growth at scale. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you again for joining us. And with that, operator, let's please now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: And at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question and welcome aboard, Allan. I wanted to ask you, you made some comments just around broadening the category, integrating with partner applications. Maybe talk about where you see the most low-hanging fruit. And as you look at the business, I mean, clearly, this is a business that has gone from high-growth into more low-growth mode as you're looking at the outlook. But where do you kind of see the medium-term opportunity here in terms of where you can get back to if you accomplish all your strategic initiatives? And then I had a quick follow-up for Cynthia.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Thanks for that. So the first thing I would say is if you think about all the steps in the agreement workflow, we did an excellent job nailing the specific use case of signing an agreement. But all of the other steps, I think, remain -- there remains plenty of opportunity to revamp that. And so as I alluded to in my prepared comments, we're excited about the opportunity, for example, to redefine what an agreement looks like. It doesn't have to be this highly formatted document. It's something you can enter on a web page. We already have clients who do this with us. Mobile carriers have people sign up through DocuSign, but it looks like a web interface. And a variety of health organizations use our new functionality to do this for patients. So, once they've gone through it once, they can pre-fill the agreements and sign-ins for future. So, I think this functionality around helping people both create the agreement and in a sense negotiate and complete them online is a significant opportunity. Looking on the personalization side. You can imagine, we do this today with Salesforce and a variety of other platforms. Reps can send out documents that are personalized and tailored to the customer based on data that's already in the system, again, a way of integrating directly with third-party applications and leveraging the simplicity and power of DocuSign. Post-agreement, I think the CLM space hold tremendous promise for DocuSign both in terms of extracting more value, more business value from agreements as well as on the risk and compliance side. And I've had a number of meetings with large enterprises that are excited about both of those use cases. So, I feel like there's actually quite a bit of breadth there, and we're just at the early stages of delivering against that opportunity.\nTyler Radke: Great. And Cynthia, you talked about some early renewals in the quarter. And I guess I'm wondering, since the Q4 guidance was kind of in line with the prior implied guide, was the early renewals kind of the -- driving most of that upside that you saw in the quarter? And if you could just unpack what you think drove those early renewals. Was it customers consuming ahead of contracts that they renegotiated down post pandemic? And if that's the case, do you still think there could be some more of that as you look out in the coming quarters? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you. So we were super pleased with where the billings number came out. It did come out better than we were expecting, and it was driven primarily by early renewals. And when you look at the customer dynamic there, I would say a few things as we have dug into it. One is it's mainly -- we have a certain level of early renewals in every quarter. We had more early renewals coming in from Q4 into Q3 this quarter than we normally would have from a Q plus one. And it's really driven by where customers are in their usage of the product and capacity. And what we were seeing was there were more customers at capacity who were looking to expand or increase their usage with add-on products. And so that was leading to early renewals because they were at capacity on their subscription. And so those were brought in a quarter earlier than the renewal would have come due. And so I think to commend our sales team, taking deals off the table as they come due in the quarter is great. And we feel good about where we are for Q4. We're not anticipating that dynamic. We will have early renewals as we always do. But that level is baked into the guide now for Q4.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great. Congrats on a really strong quarter and welcome, Allan. Wanted to ask you about a comment you made around increasing competition for the core signature use cases. Was wondering how much of your business would you say fits in that category? And then more broadly, as you've been digging in on the space, just wondering for your take or your view on the competitive landscape and DocuSign's positioning? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yeah. So first of all, I think at the highest level from a category perspective, we feel good that fundamentally helping businesses close agreements electronically, it's both a cost and productivity saving and a better customer experience. And so we think that's relatively resilient from a macro perspective. In terms of the competitive landscape, we do see some competition at the low end. I would see generic eSignature without much of the value-add that I think we excel at. And so we've got to become a little bit more engaged competitively in that space without damaging our value and premium positioning. And so we're looking at ways to do that. But the vast majority of our products -- of our revenue come from customers who appreciate the value that DocuSign delivers. I'll just give you a couple of examples. We know from a variety of surveys that customers see that when they send agreements with DocuSign, people tend to sign faster. They're more likely to sign, they're more satisfied. There's a more positive brand halo. All of that feeds into a premium positioning. In addition to that, we tend to do very well on helping with the internal workflows in the companies that adopt DocuSign, which creates cost savings and efficiencies. So I feel pretty bullish that we can maintain our position. But it's absolutely true at the low end. It's super high-volume commodity eSignature, there's more competition. And we need to be more agile in responding to that, and we're working on that as we speak.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Williams: Hey. Great. This is Austin Williams on for Michael Turrin. I just wanted to go back to the expansion rate. It looked like the expansion ticked down a touch here. Is there anything you would call out as it relates to those expansions and how we should think about that settling in from here?\nCynthia Gaylor: That was on the dollar net retention number? You broke up a little bit.\nAustin Williams: Yes.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yeah. Yeah. So on last quarter's call, we talked about kind of that trend line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we would continue to expect the trend line to push downward in Q4. I think what's embedded in that number is mainly expansion rates are moderating, and so the growth and expansion is declining. As a reminder, that's a \u2013 it's a dollar net retention number. So it's based on our book of business. The book of business is quite large. So it takes larger dollars and larger rate of expansion to move the number up. And just given some of the dynamics we've been talking about the last few quarters around expansion rates and deal sizes contracting, we would expect to see continued pressure on that particular metric for Q4.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thanks for taking my questions, and welcome, Allan. I wanted to ask a question on Agreement Cloud. As the company starts to transition over the longer term, I understand towards a more workflow-oriented business. Today, we think of eSignature as transactional. Do you think there's a different go-to-market that's required here to really materially move the needle and gain some traction there? You talked about some SI efforts there, global SIs, et cetera. I assume they would play a role there. But any thoughts on that? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So a couple of points there, I think from a customer segment perspective, we have a very nicely balanced book of business now across SMB, mid-market and enterprise. A lot of our enterprise adoption has been departmental level historic, but we're negotiating more enterprise-level agreements. I think we need to continue to evolve our sophistication and readiness there. We've brought in some leaders with great experience there, but I think we're still coming up the curve in terms of being fully ready to being a broad enter platform supplier, if you will. So that would be my \u2013 the main point I'd make on that. In terms of the other parts of the business, I think the CLM business is already very much an enterprise play. And as we've rolled that out, we've seen a lot of our larger deals have a significant CLM element. So we're pushing hard on that. I think that is still a relatively early-stage market opportunity. As you noted, there's \u2013 it's so complicated and there's so much customization on a vertical or company-specific basis that inevitably, there's a strong service element to that. While we will have a base level of services, we absolutely need third-party partners like the big SIs and others. And they're very eager. In fact, we have a lot of inbound interest to partner with DocuSign in creating combined solutions to address those needs. So, I'm bullish on that, but I want to maintain DocuSign's focus as a SaaS software company with necessary customer success and professional services elements and then augment that with the ecosystem of ISVs and SIs and others to present solutions to enterprises that have more complicated needs.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks Allan. And then one for you, Cynthia, if I may, please. Just on the guidance for next year, low single-digit billings growth. This quarter, you saw, it looks like 19%. Obviously, you had some deals pulled into Q3, but good results in comparison to kind of the guide. So, just what are you factoring in for next year? Is it a worsening macro? You talked about some elongating sales cycles and perhaps deal size compression. Are you just assuming that, that environment sustains here? Any color on just what's factored into that next year outlook? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Sure. So, we're not technically guiding to next year. We're kind of giving you our best view of what we're seeing. And again, in the spirit of being transparent, we did want to provide some direction to what we're seeing as we look into Q4 and next year. The embedded assumption there, I guess, when you look at Q3, it was 17%. Q4 is, I think, 6%. And so we're certainly seeing kind of a more challenging macro environment and some softening trends materialize, right? And I talked about kind of smaller deal sizes, smaller expansions and expansions at a slower rate. So, I think those things in particular between the macro and then what we're just seeing with customer behavior on the softening trends of expansions. Customers are still expanding, but they're just expanding at a lower rate, and that puts pressure on the growth rate. I'd also say in the macro, there's just more scrutiny by customers on spend and budgets. So, we're not modeling material degradation there or material improvement. So, we're kind of assuming just kind of a softening macro environment that we're currently seeing.\nBrad Sills: Thanks Cynthia.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you very much and I'll add my congrats. Allan, I'm interested in how commonly do you sense that some of your customers might have overprovisioned themselves with DocuSign capacity during the pandemic. And maybe now they've been drawing down some of that eSignature inventory in a manner that maybe it could position them to run out of the excess capacity. It sounded like you actually might have seen a little bit of that here in Q3 and where they might be able to reengage on new purchases. Maybe it's in the back half of next year or somewhere out beyond that.\nAllan Thygesen: I do think that we're on the tail end of that part of the cycle as we've -- significantly lapping COVID as a broad phenomenon and the stance the companies took at that time. At the same time, of course, some of our customers saw very inflated volumes during COVID and during a very low interest rate environment. You're familiar with the government loan scenario. I think the mortgage and real estate volumes, which just simply lower now even if they have completely exhausted their pre-bought envelope allotments. So, I think I'd like to be cautiously optimistic along the lines that you note. But I think there's that counteracting factor of some of the things that were the most volatile, whether it was the most pre-buying, are probably also people who are now in a different demand environment, if that makes sense.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Yeah, understood. And just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the partnership between DocuSign and Microsoft? How that might evolve over time? Because I think there's a viewpoint out there that Microsoft is conspicuously absent from this market in some ways in that perhaps they could end up offering eSignature as part of Office 365. And I'm just wondering if you see any opportunity to be involved there or perhaps if you see some other angles to that relationship.\nAllan Thygesen: Yeah. I mean there's a lot of pieces to that. First, I'd just say, look, we're really excited about our evolving partnership with Microsoft. As you know, we entered into a large strategic partnership deal with them earlier this year. They are -- and we've delivered a number of really, I think, exciting new integrations with Microsoft, with Teams, with SharePoint, Builder and others. So I'm -- and we have -- I think we're still just scratching the surface of what we're capable of in terms of integration with a variety of Microsoft platforms. So look, I expect that Microsoft and Google will have some basic eSignature capability embedded in their office suite. But I don't really think that that's the core value that we provide. We provide a lot of richness and workflow around signature that goes well beyond what I think the core office suites will supply. And I don't feel that that is the biggest competitive risk that we face. I think we're very pleased with the progress of the partnership with Microsoft and with the other software suppliers. I think most of them view us as the best-of-breed partner for them, and we want to capitalize on that. And, of course, they're a huge partner for us with our amalgamation to Azure. So that's a whole separate topic.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hey thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the great quarter. So given signature usage from existing customers and the incremental new logo next year may be impacted as a result of the macro, how do you expect your expansion motion? So thinking about CLM, notary or premium pricing insurer capabilities like ID verification to perform next year.\nAllan Thygesen: Well, I think -- on the one hand, I think you will see us expand the number of products that we have that we can offer across the entire agreement workflow, as I outlined earlier. And at the same time, I think if we make it too complicated and itemize to buy too much, we make it harder to buy and we don't necessarily include some of the features that truly differentiate us from low-end competitors. And so one of the big pushes this quarter that I initiated was a better bundling mechanism to bring together some of these features so that we make -- as well as an initial onboarding for new clients to make sure they get off to the right start and that they are using not just the core eSignature capability, but some of the other features you alluded to. And the early signs of that are promising. So we are, at the same time, I think packaging more of the features that directly relate to eSignature and making sure that we're fully selling that bundle of features and expanding our footprint to other aspects of agreement workflow that we recharge for separately.\nJake Roberge: Great. Thanks. And then, Cynthia, if you could just add any commentary on the linearity of demand trends month-to-month throughout the quarter and into November. Did anything change over the last months leading into Q4 as it relates to demand or usage of your products?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, I would say there hasn't been material changes from exiting Q3 into Q4, and that kind of informed some of our macro comments. I would say and just maybe reiterate what we said on last quarter's call, we have been seeing a little bit of shift in linearity in the quarter itself between the months. And so I would say that continued in Q3 in month three. We saw softer linearity leaving the quarter than entering the quarter than we had historically -- than we have historically seen in the kind of those quarter linearity trends -- intra-quarter.\nJake Roberge: That's helpful commentary. Thanks again for taking my questions and congrats on the great results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Allan, welcome aboard and very much looking forward to working with you. Two questions, if I may, just on the kind of preliminary outlook or framework or whatever we want to call it for next year. Really appreciate the color, a helpful way of thinking about things. I guess, just for starters, if we think about low single-digit billings growth for next year, I'm sure there's some sort of cadence there in terms of maybe lower in the first half, higher in the second half, just given the macro picture. When we think about that, I mean, that kind of implies that calendar year 2024, FY 2025 will be mid-single-digits growth. And I know it's way too early to start talking guidance for that. But maybe more importantly, what would need to be done to bridge that gap from that baseline that you're talking about based on the billings guidance to a growth rate that you'd be happy with? Because I can't imagine you'd be happy with -- given the market opportunity and everything, with mid to high single-digits growth. So, maybe can you walk through what from an execution and market opportunity standpoint needs to happen to get that growth rate to where you'd want it to be? And then I've got a follow-up.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I think, first of all, we set aside macro, which obviously weighed heavily on us as we looked out to 2024. And you don't want to presume that the economy is necessarily going to get better. So, that is embedded in our forecast. But looking beyond that, I think the key levers for us are we got to get our digital motion to work much better, and that's a huge focus and investment area for us now. We think we can capture more business that way. But until we can really prove that to ourselves, we're certainly not going to put it in our guidance. And similarly, I think we have a series of product initiatives that will roll out over the next two, three quarters that I think will dramatically broaden our footprint. But again, until we have a little bit more solidity there, it would be imprudent to include that in even a preliminary outlook. So, I think we have -- our international opportunity is another one where we'll be doing some significant investing in 2024. That market is at a much earlier stage of evolution, and we have significant headroom there. So, I think there's a number of areas where we hope to see significant upside. Obviously, I didn't join to run a low or mid-single-digit revenue company. So, I'm pushing very hard to get us to a different place, and we're -- we hope to have a lot of news to report on that over the next few quarters.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. And I may--\nRishi Jaluria: Sorry, go ahead.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Sorry, I might just add to that. The -- our fiscal 2024 is calendar 2023, right? So, that's -- it's an outlook. It's not a guide; 90 days from now we'll give a more specific guide, so we'll be able to give you more detail there. Understand what you're talking about in terms of calendar 2023 into calendar 2024. As we said, we would expect the first half of next year to be kind of get off to a slower start, and that's partly macro and it's partly the initiatives that Allan was talking about. We are going to take some time to gain traction. And so the scenario where, I guess, calendar 2024 could be better would mean that macro has probably gotten better and then some of the initiatives are starting to take off. And you start seeing that in the back half of next year, because that can spill into the following year. I would just say, though, our -- when we give guidance and we give outlook, and you all have been following the company for quite some time, there are opportunities and there are risks. And we've, I think, balanced those things in what we're telling you in the spirit of the 2024 is really to provide transparency to what we're currently seeing, but it's still balancing those opportunities and risks. So I just want to make sure that you all understand that.\nAllan Thygesen: Yeah. I mean, I think what I would just add to that, Cynthia is exactly right. What we're giving you now is an extrapolation of our current trends. We have a lot of levers that we're pulling, and we hope to be able to update you on those over the course of the next several calls. We're bullish on long-term prospects. We think we have a lot of headroom and are very well-positioned.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Fantastic. Really helpful, both of you. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. If we think about the margin, not guidance, for next year, you're talking about the low end to about 20%. I guess given that you also have all these cost savings that you've been working at generating over the past quarter, two quarters, a 9% rip. I imagine that a lot of the upside that you're getting from those cost savings, you're reinvesting in the area. So maybe can you walk us through why would margins not be higher. And if it is, in fact, you're just reinvesting in other areas, what are those top investment priorities that's getting that margin to 20%, again, in spite of the cost cutting focus and the 9% rip? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. I'll talk about the margin and then Allan can talk about some of the investments. So on the margin, our long-term target margin has been 20% to 25%. So we're expecting to be at the lower end of that into next year would be what we'd expect. So we would get some uplift from the restructuring that we've done and are in the process of completing. But we -- as you said, we would be reinvesting in the business. And it's -- a lot of it is around things like international, the go-to-market initiatives and R&D in particular. And those pieces, I think, are going to be really important.\nAllan Thygesen: Yeah. Just to add to what Cynthia was saying, look, I think our go-to-market motion needs to become more efficient. We need to grow into -- we've made some adjustments. We need to grow into the infrastructure that we have and do a lot more on the digital side, as I've alluded to. So that's an area where I would hope to see our metrics continue to improve. I feel differently about our R&D investment. We are, frankly, below many of our SaaS peers in terms of our divestment relative revenue. And I think we have a lot of ideas, a lot of opportunity here. And I think we -- to the extent that we invest beyond baseline, that will probably where the bulk of it goes.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Hi, there. Thanks very much. Allan, maybe following on to your last comment on the go-to-market. Have most of those changes been put in place, I guess, to date? Obviously, some of those it's difficult to do that as you're trying to close up a fiscal year. Or are you waiting to sort of instrument some changes, perhaps on the direct side, as we get into the beginning of next year? I was just trying to get a sense on if there's still some -- I assume there's always going to be some tweaking, but have some of the more fundamental changes been established, or is that something that you're still waiting on doing once you close out this fiscal year?\nAllan Thygesen: No, we're not planning any broad efforts risk type of structures along the lines of what we did for the whole company last quarter. We're going to continue to tweak. I mean, I think the market environment is dynamic. We're going to continue to move resources around, as I alluded to. And individual functions and departments in the go-to-market function elsewhere, I think we'll see some prioritization or de-prioritization. But I'm not looking to do anything at the macro company-wide level. I do expect that we will get significantly more productive and efficient in our go-to-market motion and that's a hugely for us. In addition to the digital side, we've had an all-hands-on-deck effort to remove friction internally and to just realign and combine functions. We were overly segmented, I believe. And so there was just a lot of work to get our field operation organization in a better state. I think Steve Shute, our President of Fuels has done a very nice job pulling that together, bringing in senior leaders. And I think we're much better poised to grow with the resources that we have today than we were six months ago. And some of those initiatives that I alluded to on the self-serve side will obviously bear more fruit in the next few quarters.\nKirk Materne: That's really helpful. And then, Cynthia, really quickly, you brought up, obviously, in the cash flow discussion the ERP implementation. Are there any other big systems that need to be sort of upgraded given you guys have scaled so quickly, or is that sort of the biggest one that was outstanding? Just trying to get a sense if that's another area of potential spend for you all next year.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, I mean we need to continue to invest in our systems and more automation. But I would say ERP has been a multiyear endeavor that started before I even joined the company. So, it's a big milestone for the company that will enable a lot of other automation to happen. So, we'll continue to invest there, but I wouldn't expect another project as large as that project and cross-functional in the near-term.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I agree with that. Just to add to that, I think -- I don't think there's anything huge to talk about from an investment perspective. But just for color, this company feels like it has one of every SaaS product that's been backed by the venture industry in the last 10 years, certainly. So, we need to dramatically clean that up and get to a much smaller number of anchor tools. In addition to our ERP system, the other big focus this year has been on our sales force implementation, which obviously is a core platform. I think we're in much better shape now than we were at the beginning of the year. And there's a couple of other areas where I think we have opportunity to dramatically simplify and consolidate and that will help everyone become more productive. But it's not going to have not going to be able a magnitude that Cynthia went through with the ERP project.\nKirk Materne: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you all.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Allan Thygesen for closing remarks.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining to hear more about where we're headed. I'm excited to be on this call with all of you and to be leading this incredible iconic company. In closing, we believe we delivered a solid Q3, and we're focused on delivering an exciting product roadmap and improving the efficiency of our go-to-market to drive growth and profitability. My first two months have affirmed DocuSign's tremendous headroom, strong customer relationships and world-class talent. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers and our partners for their warm welcome and the insights dedication they've shared. I look forward to updating all of you as we make progress. Thank you for joining.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Thank you and have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Excellent. Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q3 results, delivering on the top and bottom line. We continue to expand our customer base and remain focused on progress against our key priorities as we execute against our long-term strategy. As the macro becomes more challenging, we are seeing softening demand trends materialize, including smaller deal sizes and expansion, with increased customer scrutiny on priorities and budgets in some cases. On the other hand, we are still seeing healthy results as customers recognize DocuSign offers high-ROI applications that are easy to use, efficient and cost-effective. Let me now review our Q3 results. Total revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $645 million, and subscription revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $624 million. The continued strengthening of the US dollar resulted in a couple-point headwind to total revenue growth in the quarter, in line with our previous expectations. The impact was not material to our results. Our international revenue grew 23% year-over-year to reach $157 million in the third quarter, representing 24% of our total revenue. Third quarter billings grew 17% year-over-year to $659 million as our installed base continued to expand. The strength in billings growth was partially driven by early renewals, particularly renewals from Q4. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter billings can fluctuate due to the timing and completion of deals, including timing of renewals and expansions. Customer growth remained strong as we added approximately 42,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total installed base to 1.32 million customers worldwide at the end of Q3, a 19% increase compared to a year ago. This includes the addition of approximately 10,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of $202,000, a 26% increase over last year. We also saw a 34% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,052 customers. These results demonstrate progress against our key initiatives. However, we continue to see the effects of a more challenging macro environment. Real estate and financial service verticals continue to see headwind. So even within these sectors, we see pockets of expansion with customers for specific use cases. Expansion use cases underscore our product differentiation and value for our customers as we continue to invest in innovation around broader agreement workflows. As it relates to verticals, we are also encouraged by relative strength in our manufacturing, retail, business services and technology sectors, highlighting the important benefit of our diversified customer base. And while the global slowdown presented challenges more generally, we saw varying degrees of strength and weakness across all regions and segments. Dollar net retention was 108% for the quarter. We continue to see more muted buying patterns and slower expansion rates from customers in the current climate. We expect buying patterns to remain cautious in the near-term, resulting in dollar net retention continuing to trend downward for the remainder of the year. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 83% compared to 82% last year. Q3 non-GAAP operating profit reached $147 million compared with $122 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% from 22% last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $118 million compared with $121 million in the third quarter of last year. As noted on our Q1 call this year, we introduced a non-GAAP tax rate within our non-GAAP net income calculation as we reached consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior three years. We're using a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for fiscal 2023. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. In September, we announced a restructuring plan, which included a workforce reduction in response to the changing environment. This was not an easy decision, but was an important step for the health of the business. Our GAAP results include $28 million in Q3 restructuring-related expenses as we take a long-term view of the opportunity ahead, we will evaluate the best ways to reinvest capital into areas that accelerate initiatives and present the strongest return. We are committed to making progress in a sustainable way towards our long-term target margin. We ended Q3 with 7,522 employees compared to 7,056 last year. The restructuring process is well underway, and we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal year. The workforce reductions, coupled with more disciplined spending and cost containment throughout the company, drove strong Q3 non-GAAP operating margin. While we are pleased with the Q3 margin, we delayed some spend in the quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate the most critical areas for investment. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $53 million, representing an 8% margin. Free cash flow was $36 million or a 6% margin. As we mentioned on our Q2 earnings call, during the third quarter, we implemented a new ERP, a foundational system for our company. The go-live was successful, with smooth implementation and no material disruptions to our core processes. As noted on our last call, the timing of cash collections and payments were impacted by the ERP transition as we anticipated, and some were pushed from Q3 to Q4. We also incurred one-time cash expenses in Q3 related to the restructuring. On a more normalized basis, excluding the impact from the restructuring and our ERP implementation, our operating cash flow margin would have been approximately 14%, and our free cash flow margin would have been approximately 12%. This compares with operating cash flow of $105 million or a 19% margin and free cash flow of $90 million or 17% margin for the same period last year. We expect lower restructuring cash payments to benefit fourth quarter cash flows relative to Q3. We exited Q3 with more than $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Turning to our share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 740,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $38 million, which demonstrates our confidence in the durability of our business and in the opportunities ahead. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately $137 million in remaining buyback capacity. We remain committed to opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to our Q4 and fiscal '23 guidance. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year '23, we anticipate total revenue of $637 million to $641 million in Q4 or a growth of 10% year-over-year and $2.493 billion to $2.497 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $624 million to $628 million in Q4 or growth of 11% year-over-year and $2.423 billion to $2.427 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 19% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $705 million to $715 million in Q4 or growth of 5% to 7% year-over-year and $2.626 billion to $2.636 billion for fiscal '23 or growth of 11% to 12% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 82% to 83% for Q4 and 81% to 82% for fiscal '23. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 20% to 22% for Q4 and 18% to 20% for fiscal '23. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 205 million to 210 million for both Q4 and fiscal '23. Looking ahead, we are in the early stages of planning for next year and focused on executing across our critical priorities to finish the year strong. While we will not be formally providing guidance for next year, we would like to share a preliminary outlook for fiscal '24 informed by what we are seeing across the business and in the broader macro environment. We currently expect a slower start to the fiscal year. For total revenue, we would expect high single-digit growth during fiscal '24. For billings, we would expect low single-digit growth for next year. We're committed to maintaining our disciplined approach to expenses, carefully addressing and prioritizing strategic investments that will drive our sustainable growth at scale. As a result, we expect to operate at the lower end of our long-term target operating margin range of 20% to 25% in fiscal '24. In closing, we delivered a solid Q3 despite a challenging operating environment. To drive growth, we'll continue to invest thoughtfully and closely monitor the returns on our investments, pivot as needed and evaluate opportunities to drive growth, efficiency and profitability at scale. Our Q3 results are a meaningful indicator of the strength of our business and the customer value proposition we deliver, that allows us to delight our customers in a meaningful way. We are thrilled to welcome Allan to DocuSign and want to take a moment to also thank our team for their exceptional work and focus during this time of transition. While we know it will take time for our progress to be fully reflected in our financial results, we are committed to advancing the business and executing against our long-term strategy, while delivering sustainable growth at scale. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you again for joining us. And with that, operator, let's please now open up the call for questions. Thank you. So we were super pleased with where the billings number came out. It did come out better than we were expecting, and it was driven primarily by early renewals. And when you look at the customer dynamic there, I would say a few things as we have dug into it. One is it's mainly -- we have a certain level of early renewals in every quarter. We had more early renewals coming in from Q4 into Q3 this quarter than we normally would have from a Q plus one. And it's really driven by where customers are in their usage of the product and capacity. And what we were seeing was there were more customers at capacity who were looking to expand or increase their usage with add-on products. And so that was leading to early renewals because they were at capacity on their subscription. And so those were brought in a quarter earlier than the renewal would have come due. And so I think to commend our sales team, taking deals off the table as they come due in the quarter is great. And we feel good about where we are for Q4. We're not anticipating that dynamic. We will have early renewals as we always do. But that level is baked into the guide now for Q4. That was on the dollar net retention number? You broke up a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. So on last quarter's call, we talked about kind of that trend line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we would continue to expect the trend line to push downward in Q4. I think what's embedded in that number is mainly expansion rates are moderating, and so the growth and expansion is declining. As a reminder, that's a \u2013 it's a dollar net retention number. So it's based on our book of business. The book of business is quite large. So it takes larger dollars and larger rate of expansion to move the number up. And just given some of the dynamics we've been talking about the last few quarters around expansion rates and deal sizes contracting, we would expect to see continued pressure on that particular metric for Q4. Yes. Sure. So, we're not technically guiding to next year. We're kind of giving you our best view of what we're seeing. And again, in the spirit of being transparent, we did want to provide some direction to what we're seeing as we look into Q4 and next year. The embedded assumption there, I guess, when you look at Q3, it was 17%. Q4 is, I think, 6%. And so we're certainly seeing kind of a more challenging macro environment and some softening trends materialize, right? And I talked about kind of smaller deal sizes, smaller expansions and expansions at a slower rate. So, I think those things in particular between the macro and then what we're just seeing with customer behavior on the softening trends of expansions. Customers are still expanding, but they're just expanding at a lower rate, and that puts pressure on the growth rate. I'd also say in the macro, there's just more scrutiny by customers on spend and budgets. So, we're not modeling material degradation there or material improvement. So, we're kind of assuming just kind of a softening macro environment that we're currently seeing. Yes, I would say there hasn't been material changes from exiting Q3 into Q4, and that kind of informed some of our macro comments. I would say and just maybe reiterate what we said on last quarter's call, we have been seeing a little bit of shift in linearity in the quarter itself between the months. And so I would say that continued in Q3 in month three. We saw softer linearity leaving the quarter than entering the quarter than we had historically -- than we have historically seen in the kind of those quarter linearity trends -- intra-quarter. Yes. And I may-- Yes. Sorry, I might just add to that. The -- our fiscal 2024 is calendar 2023, right? So, that's -- it's an outlook. It's not a guide; 90 days from now we'll give a more specific guide, so we'll be able to give you more detail there. Understand what you're talking about in terms of calendar 2023 into calendar 2024. As we said, we would expect the first half of next year to be kind of get off to a slower start, and that's partly macro and it's partly the initiatives that Allan was talking about. We are going to take some time to gain traction. And so the scenario where, I guess, calendar 2024 could be better would mean that macro has probably gotten better and then some of the initiatives are starting to take off. And you start seeing that in the back half of next year, because that can spill into the following year. I would just say, though, our -- when we give guidance and we give outlook, and you all have been following the company for quite some time, there are opportunities and there are risks. And we've, I think, balanced those things in what we're telling you in the spirit of the 2024 is really to provide transparency to what we're currently seeing, but it's still balancing those opportunities and risks. So I just want to make sure that you all understand that. Sure. I'll talk about the margin and then Allan can talk about some of the investments. So on the margin, our long-term target margin has been 20% to 25%. So we're expecting to be at the lower end of that into next year would be what we'd expect. So we would get some uplift from the restructuring that we've done and are in the process of completing. But we -- as you said, we would be reinvesting in the business. And it's -- a lot of it is around things like international, the go-to-market initiatives and R&D in particular. And those pieces, I think, are going to be really important. Yes, I mean we need to continue to invest in our systems and more automation. But I would say ERP has been a multiyear endeavor that started before I even joined the company. So, it's a big milestone for the company that will enable a lot of other automation to happen. So, we'll continue to invest there, but I wouldn't expect another project as large as that project and cross-functional in the near-term."

            "name": "Allan Thygesen",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to be here for my first earnings call as DocuSign's CEO. I'd like to begin by thanking Maggie Wilderotter for leading the team as Interim CEO. Maggie set the stage for a smooth and seamless transition, and we're grateful to her for her leadership and for her continued stewardship as our Board Chair. There are three main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. First, we delivered solid third quarter results, exceeding the key operating metrics we laid out last quarter despite the continued macro headwinds. Our results are a reflection, I think, of the continued signs of stabilization across the business. I'd like to commend our team for their unwavering commitment despite the considerable distraction. Second, as the global leader in the eSignature category, DocuSign is expanding across broader agreement related workflows. We have challenges to address, but we have an exceptionally strong foundation and meaningful competitive advantage, which leads me to my third point. I believe our future is bright. Along with the team, I'm personally energized by the opportunity and the work that lies ahead. I'm confident in our progress, and I believe we are unequivocally well-positioned for the long-term. Now before I move on to discuss the future of our business, I want to share what compelled me to join DocuSign. I followed the company for many years, and like our over 1 billion users, I find our value proposition distinctive and invaluable. We've built a powerful brand that's recognized by decision-makers well before we even engage with them. That combination of affinity that DocuSign has with customers and users, and our untapped market potential is very rare in the enterprise software space. DocuSign created and built the eSignature category, yet agreement process are still at the early stages of moving from pen to paper to more automated ways of working. In fact, I believe we're just at the beginning of revolutionizing how businesses initiate, negotiate and manage agreements, and we will leave that as we did for e-Signature. We provide solutions for customers of all sizes, industries and functions. During my almost 12 years at Google, I first led the global SMB and mid-market business, and then the enterprise business in the Americas, including managing our relationships with our largest global partners. I've experienced firsthand how exceptionally powerful a broad, diversified customer base can be, and I'm excited to bring that experience to DocuSign. For my first 60 days, I've focused on gaining a deeper understanding of our business, meeting with employees across the company as well as spending time with customers and partners. Through these conversations, I've started to identify some critical areas in which we can improve to strengthen our value proposition in addition to scaling the business by streamlining and creating efficiencies. I continue to see customers embrace and expand with our core eSignature offering. For example, this past quarter, one of the UK's largest health care providers expanded their use of e-Signature. They began the journey as a customer during the pandemic, and they've now migrated their entire patient onboarding process and adopted our products across their HR, legal, joint ventures and other departments. Key criteria in the recent competitive selection process, included privacy and security of their customer data, and the ability to utilize the advanced workflow features we offer. Notwithstanding our considerable strengths, I believe it's important to acknowledge where we have not executed as well. It's clear we did not pivot quickly enough and we were slow to make changes. As we experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic, we did not scale the team properly. We lost some innovation velocity. We didn't fully address the changing market dynamics nor mature our operations and systems sufficiently. We understand those gaps, and we're committed to moving forward with more transparency. I think the good news is that the future is in our own hands. So let me turn to our focus going forward. We are committed to broadening the category. That starts with a more clearly defined product road map that leverages our core eSignature strength and our ambition of delivering easier, smarter, trusted agreements. We see opportunities beyond the replacement of paper signatures to deliver innovative new experiences and integrate more deeply with partner applications. If you think about it, many use cases don't require editing or completion of the static, unstructured, highly formatted traditional agreement. Instead, I think data capture for agreements should happen through digital forms on the web or in an app. The agreements themselves should be dynamically generated, and the metadata should be automatically captured to enable personalization for future interactions. With our new web forms offering, which is currently in early beta, we're enabling our customers to transition from a PDF-centric experience to guided web-native experiences. We're also continuing to innovate on the CLM front, further solidifying our vision, customer validation and execution within the CLM space. Most recently, DocuSign was named the leader in the Gartner 2022 Magic Quadrant for CLM for the third consecutive year. We are placed highest of all vendors on the ability to execute access and second highest on the completeness of vision access. These products directly support each other. We're encouraged by how existing eSignature customers continue to embrace our CLM capabilities to enhance and speed their workflows. For example, this past quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of the largest ride-sharing organizations. Our team identified key areas of expansion using our Signature and CLM product to support their evolving business needs. They expanded their eSignature footprint and are now more streamlined in their internal processes, thanks to our CLM offering. Over the next few quarters, we'll expand our work here and augment the road map to broaden the power of managing workflows throughout the agreement life cycle. While we're not seeing dramatic shifts recently in the competitive landscape, it is important to recognize that today's market is more competitive, particularly for the basic sign use cases, which further highlights the importance of an innovative and differentiated product portfolio like DocuSign's. I want to touch on our plans to improve operations and sales productivity. While we are continuing to lead with innovation, we are staying hyper-focused on making the customer experience more seamless and integrated, particularly with our go-to-market motion. I think that starts with bolstering our self-service mill initiatives. I was deeply involved in enabling self-serving for every stage of the order cycle for customers at -- of all sizes at Google, and I know the power of a frictionless experience. I'm confident we can achieve both improved customer experiences and greater go-to-market efficiency as we move in this direction. We already have over 1 million customers who self-serve. The inbound traffic to our website continues to grow, and we have a highly recognized and trusted brand. So we have a lot to work with. We also want to create stronger efficiencies in our direct sales and field efforts and strengthen our partner ecosystem. So I'm pleased that sales attrition is continuing to moderate, and we're seeing stabilization in the field. Moving forward, we're focused on improving funnel conversion, consolidating and streamlining our teams, strengthening our focus on customer success and retention and implementing new incentive structures, all with the goal of driving efficiency and accountability. We're also leaning in on simplifying our pricing and packaging strategy, recently began rolling out new product bundles to enable customers to more easily access useful and differentiated productivity features, which in turn further the customer ROI and improve retention and being the customer a richer experience. We know that customers who use more than three features are more likely to expand their footprint with us, and that will be critical for more profitable growth at scale. We already have an industry-leading partner ecosystem. This represents a significant opportunity to expand customer value and distribution reach through our network of ISVs, resellers, system integrators and developers. By reimagining how we engage that ecosystem, we expect to create a platform that will see stronger revenue contribution from our partners and help unlock and fuel international expansion opportunities in particular. I personally visited customers and teams in four of our key European markets last week, which reaffirmed that one of our most significant growth opportunities, will come from international markets. During the trip, I had the pleasure to meet with one of the world's leading communications carriers. They've been a customer for seven years now. Our account team identified key areas to drive growth with expanded use cases, which accelerated adoption, which in turn led to an early renewal expansion. So we're excited to grow our footprint in their ecosystem as they continue to leverage our products to digitize their customer experience and reduce operating expenses while helping to create a more sustainable future. Lastly, internally, our operational focus has been on streamlining our processes, upgrading our internal systems and modernizing more of our own workflows to improve efficiency and scalability. As an example, we just closed our first quarter on our new ERP system, which has been a key dependency for automating more of our operations. In summary, I believe we're acting with urgency to recalibrate the business and leverage our strong foundation to adapt to the evolving business landscape and the changing and challenging macro environment. These efforts will take time, and they represent a continued evolution for DocuSign. However, I am fully confident that the opportunity is here for DocuSign and is within our reach with a clear strategy, focus and execution. Thank you for your time today. I'm thrilled to be leading DocuSign, and I'm committed to being transparent with all of you about our progress as we move forward. Now, I'll hand it over to Cynthia, who will take you through our Q3 financial results and outlook. Cynthia? Yes. Thanks for that. So the first thing I would say is if you think about all the steps in the agreement workflow, we did an excellent job nailing the specific use case of signing an agreement. But all of the other steps, I think, remain -- there remains plenty of opportunity to revamp that. And so as I alluded to in my prepared comments, we're excited about the opportunity, for example, to redefine what an agreement looks like. It doesn't have to be this highly formatted document. It's something you can enter on a web page. We already have clients who do this with us. Mobile carriers have people sign up through DocuSign, but it looks like a web interface. And a variety of health organizations use our new functionality to do this for patients. So, once they've gone through it once, they can pre-fill the agreements and sign-ins for future. So, I think this functionality around helping people both create the agreement and in a sense negotiate and complete them online is a significant opportunity. Looking on the personalization side. You can imagine, we do this today with Salesforce and a variety of other platforms. Reps can send out documents that are personalized and tailored to the customer based on data that's already in the system, again, a way of integrating directly with third-party applications and leveraging the simplicity and power of DocuSign. Post-agreement, I think the CLM space hold tremendous promise for DocuSign both in terms of extracting more value, more business value from agreements as well as on the risk and compliance side. And I've had a number of meetings with large enterprises that are excited about both of those use cases. So, I feel like there's actually quite a bit of breadth there, and we're just at the early stages of delivering against that opportunity. Yeah. So first of all, I think at the highest level from a category perspective, we feel good that fundamentally helping businesses close agreements electronically, it's both a cost and productivity saving and a better customer experience. And so we think that's relatively resilient from a macro perspective. In terms of the competitive landscape, we do see some competition at the low end. I would see generic eSignature without much of the value-add that I think we excel at. And so we've got to become a little bit more engaged competitively in that space without damaging our value and premium positioning. And so we're looking at ways to do that. But the vast majority of our products -- of our revenue come from customers who appreciate the value that DocuSign delivers. I'll just give you a couple of examples. We know from a variety of surveys that customers see that when they send agreements with DocuSign, people tend to sign faster. They're more likely to sign, they're more satisfied. There's a more positive brand halo. All of that feeds into a premium positioning. In addition to that, we tend to do very well on helping with the internal workflows in the companies that adopt DocuSign, which creates cost savings and efficiencies. So I feel pretty bullish that we can maintain our position. But it's absolutely true at the low end. It's super high-volume commodity eSignature, there's more competition. And we need to be more agile in responding to that, and we're working on that as we speak. Yes. So a couple of points there, I think from a customer segment perspective, we have a very nicely balanced book of business now across SMB, mid-market and enterprise. A lot of our enterprise adoption has been departmental level historic, but we're negotiating more enterprise-level agreements. I think we need to continue to evolve our sophistication and readiness there. We've brought in some leaders with great experience there, but I think we're still coming up the curve in terms of being fully ready to being a broad enter platform supplier, if you will. So that would be my \u2013 the main point I'd make on that. In terms of the other parts of the business, I think the CLM business is already very much an enterprise play. And as we've rolled that out, we've seen a lot of our larger deals have a significant CLM element. So we're pushing hard on that. I think that is still a relatively early-stage market opportunity. As you noted, there's \u2013 it's so complicated and there's so much customization on a vertical or company-specific basis that inevitably, there's a strong service element to that. While we will have a base level of services, we absolutely need third-party partners like the big SIs and others. And they're very eager. In fact, we have a lot of inbound interest to partner with DocuSign in creating combined solutions to address those needs. So, I'm bullish on that, but I want to maintain DocuSign's focus as a SaaS software company with necessary customer success and professional services elements and then augment that with the ecosystem of ISVs and SIs and others to present solutions to enterprises that have more complicated needs. I do think that we're on the tail end of that part of the cycle as we've -- significantly lapping COVID as a broad phenomenon and the stance the companies took at that time. At the same time, of course, some of our customers saw very inflated volumes during COVID and during a very low interest rate environment. You're familiar with the government loan scenario. I think the mortgage and real estate volumes, which just simply lower now even if they have completely exhausted their pre-bought envelope allotments. So, I think I'd like to be cautiously optimistic along the lines that you note. But I think there's that counteracting factor of some of the things that were the most volatile, whether it was the most pre-buying, are probably also people who are now in a different demand environment, if that makes sense. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of pieces to that. First, I'd just say, look, we're really excited about our evolving partnership with Microsoft. As you know, we entered into a large strategic partnership deal with them earlier this year. They are -- and we've delivered a number of really, I think, exciting new integrations with Microsoft, with Teams, with SharePoint, Builder and others. So I'm -- and we have -- I think we're still just scratching the surface of what we're capable of in terms of integration with a variety of Microsoft platforms. So look, I expect that Microsoft and Google will have some basic eSignature capability embedded in their office suite. But I don't really think that that's the core value that we provide. We provide a lot of richness and workflow around signature that goes well beyond what I think the core office suites will supply. And I don't feel that that is the biggest competitive risk that we face. I think we're very pleased with the progress of the partnership with Microsoft and with the other software suppliers. I think most of them view us as the best-of-breed partner for them, and we want to capitalize on that. And, of course, they're a huge partner for us with our amalgamation to Azure. So that's a whole separate topic. Well, I think -- on the one hand, I think you will see us expand the number of products that we have that we can offer across the entire agreement workflow, as I outlined earlier. And at the same time, I think if we make it too complicated and itemize to buy too much, we make it harder to buy and we don't necessarily include some of the features that truly differentiate us from low-end competitors. And so one of the big pushes this quarter that I initiated was a better bundling mechanism to bring together some of these features so that we make -- as well as an initial onboarding for new clients to make sure they get off to the right start and that they are using not just the core eSignature capability, but some of the other features you alluded to. And the early signs of that are promising. So we are, at the same time, I think packaging more of the features that directly relate to eSignature and making sure that we're fully selling that bundle of features and expanding our footprint to other aspects of agreement workflow that we recharge for separately. Yes, I think, first of all, we set aside macro, which obviously weighed heavily on us as we looked out to 2024. And you don't want to presume that the economy is necessarily going to get better. So, that is embedded in our forecast. But looking beyond that, I think the key levers for us are we got to get our digital motion to work much better, and that's a huge focus and investment area for us now. We think we can capture more business that way. But until we can really prove that to ourselves, we're certainly not going to put it in our guidance. And similarly, I think we have a series of product initiatives that will roll out over the next two, three quarters that I think will dramatically broaden our footprint. But again, until we have a little bit more solidity there, it would be imprudent to include that in even a preliminary outlook. So, I think we have -- our international opportunity is another one where we'll be doing some significant investing in 2024. That market is at a much earlier stage of evolution, and we have significant headroom there. So, I think there's a number of areas where we hope to see significant upside. Obviously, I didn't join to run a low or mid-single-digit revenue company. So, I'm pushing very hard to get us to a different place, and we're -- we hope to have a lot of news to report on that over the next few quarters. Yeah. I mean, I think what I would just add to that, Cynthia is exactly right. What we're giving you now is an extrapolation of our current trends. We have a lot of levers that we're pulling, and we hope to be able to update you on those over the course of the next several calls. We're bullish on long-term prospects. We think we have a lot of headroom and are very well-positioned. Yeah. Just to add to what Cynthia was saying, look, I think our go-to-market motion needs to become more efficient. We need to grow into -- we've made some adjustments. We need to grow into the infrastructure that we have and do a lot more on the digital side, as I've alluded to. So that's an area where I would hope to see our metrics continue to improve. I feel differently about our R&D investment. We are, frankly, below many of our SaaS peers in terms of our divestment relative revenue. And I think we have a lot of ideas, a lot of opportunity here. And I think we -- to the extent that we invest beyond baseline, that will probably where the bulk of it goes. No, we're not planning any broad efforts risk type of structures along the lines of what we did for the whole company last quarter. We're going to continue to tweak. I mean, I think the market environment is dynamic. We're going to continue to move resources around, as I alluded to. And individual functions and departments in the go-to-market function elsewhere, I think we'll see some prioritization or de-prioritization. But I'm not looking to do anything at the macro company-wide level. I do expect that we will get significantly more productive and efficient in our go-to-market motion and that's a hugely for us. In addition to the digital side, we've had an all-hands-on-deck effort to remove friction internally and to just realign and combine functions. We were overly segmented, I believe. And so there was just a lot of work to get our field operation organization in a better state. I think Steve Shute, our President of Fuels has done a very nice job pulling that together, bringing in senior leaders. And I think we're much better poised to grow with the resources that we have today than we were six months ago. And some of those initiatives that I alluded to on the self-serve side will obviously bear more fruit in the next few quarters. Yes, I agree with that. Just to add to that, I think -- I don't think there's anything huge to talk about from an investment perspective. But just for color, this company feels like it has one of every SaaS product that's been backed by the venture industry in the last 10 years, certainly. So, we need to dramatically clean that up and get to a much smaller number of anchor tools. In addition to our ERP system, the other big focus this year has been on our sales force implementation, which obviously is a core platform. I think we're in much better shape now than we were at the beginning of the year. And there's a couple of other areas where I think we have opportunity to dramatically simplify and consolidate and that will help everyone become more productive. But it's not going to have not going to be able a magnitude that Cynthia went through with the ERP project. Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining to hear more about where we're headed. I'm excited to be on this call with all of you and to be leading this incredible iconic company. In closing, we believe we delivered a solid Q3, and we're focused on delivering an exciting product roadmap and improving the efficiency of our go-to-market to drive growth and profitability. My first two months have affirmed DocuSign's tremendous headroom, strong customer relationships and world-class talent. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers and our partners for their warm welcome and the insights dedication they've shared. I look forward to updating all of you as we make progress. Thank you for joining."

I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Maggie Wilderotter. Maggie?\nMaggie Wilderotter: Thanks very much, Heather and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. First, let me introduce myself. I have been on the DocuSign Board for over 5 years and Board Chair for the last few years. In addition to my Board service here at DocuSign, I also sit on several other public and private Boards. I have had the privilege to serve on 51 corporate Boards in my career, 36 public and 15 private, starting at age 28 when I first joined a corporate Board. I also have 18 years of CEO operating experience at private and public companies, and most recently was CEO of a Fortune 500, Frontier Communications, for 12 years, retiring 5 years ago. I have had the privilege in my career to hire and lead great teams, to find clear strategies for success, driving results through clarity of deliverables and accountability. And I have also done so with a maniacal focus on serving customers, both internal and external. I am taking the same approach in my interim role as CEO of DocuSign. Since joining as CEO, I prioritized connecting with customers and employees around the globe through frequent town halls, office visits, virtual connections and in-person meetings. This broad focus on listening, learning and interacting has enabled me to move quickly to set a new agenda for success. We entered Q3 with a clear set of vital few deliverables for our people initiatives, product roadmap and our focus on improving sustainable and profitable growth at scale. 6 of our 8 executive leaders joined during Q2 and are seasoned scale players. They join Cynthia Gaylor, our CFO that you are going to hear from after me and also Shanthi Iyer, our CIO, on the executive leadership team. Our new executive leadership team and I have worked together over the past few weeks to clarify a clear strategic focus and define what is required from all employees for DocuSign to be successful. Let me start with our strategy. DocuSign is the leader in providing end-to-end digital agreements on a fully integrated platform. This starts with delivering simple, intuitive, integrated and trusted customer and partner experiences that remove friction from all steps in creating, using and managing digital agreements. To support this strategy, we have upgraded talent, launched retention initiatives to include a new employee training program that will commence this month teaching our teams how to operate with excellence. Inhi Suh, our new President of Product has already put in place a clear product roadmap that mapped out releases starting next month. Steve Shute, our new President of go-to-market, has revamped our selling motion and performance expectations for the small, medium business and enterprise segments. Our marketing team is delivering new collateral, messaging and tools for Steve\u2019s teams as well as a simplified digital motion for consumers and one-time users. Finally, DocuSign has also added two additional seasoned scale leaders. I am pleased that Jennifer Christie is our new Chief Human Resources Officer and veteran Jim Shaughnessy is our new General Counsel. I am privileged to lead such a terrific group of executives who have all hit the ground running by working together with a single focus, set the company on a path for continuous performance improvements in Q3 and Q4 and beyond. I am optimistic about the power of our brand, our value proposition for customers and partners and the renewed results orientation being embraced by our employee base. Finally, the search for our next CEO is a top board priority. All of our independent directors have been actively interviewing great candidates and we are close to making a decision. Terrific candidate pool participating in this process has reinforced the strength of our brand and the shared belief that DocuSign has a tremendous future growth opportunity. I look forward to letting you know who the next CEO will be. With this preface, let me turn to some other Q2 results highlights. As you have seen in our earnings release, Q2 revenue was $622 million, representing a 22% year-over-year increase. We added 44,000 new customers during the quarter, again, a 22% increase year-over-year, which brings our total global paying customer count to 1.28 million. We delivered an 18% operating margin in Q2 as well. The second half of this fiscal year, our goal is to drive operating expense reductions in order to meet the current operating margin guidance range of 16% to 18% that we had previously communicated to you. We are reviewing all categories of expenses and will adjust our spending accordingly. These expected expense reduction initiatives will create capacity for the right investments for our expected scale growth. For example, our IT and internal systems development teams are focused on key automation and software system upgrades, including our planned ERP system cutover this quarter. These enhanced capabilities will enable us to eliminate current manual processes resulting in lower operational costs in the back half of this fiscal year and it will also improve our customer and partner experiences. I am excited to share that we closed a number of large enterprise deals during the quarter that include both Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. In addition, our focus on partner expansion includes a new integration with Stripe to enable users of both product sets to view DocuSign agreements and Stripe payments side by side. Stripe customers can also create new DocuSign agreements directly from Stripe dashboards. This is another strong example of taking friction out of the customer agreement transaction. Over the past few months, with increasing interest rates and inflation on a macroeconomic level, we also have started to see some softness in certain verticals like real estate and financial services. But despite these headwinds, our business model benefits from a well-diversified customer base across industries, geographies and segments. Our products help all of our customers from large to small improve their productivity, be more efficient and improve their time to value creation. In closing, I am honored to continue to lead the DocuSign team until a successor is in place. During this time, we remain committed to stay focused on our vital few priorities, driving profitable growth at scale and delivering further enhancements to the digital agreement platform to delight our customers. We have a $50 billion global market opportunity with an industry leading product and market share position. We will use this position to aggressively expand our capabilities through wise investments, focus and continuous improvement in our performance. DocuSign cannot be successful without strong shareholder support. So let me end my remarks here with thanking all of you for your continued support of our company. We know our results over the previous three quarters did not meet expectations. We got the message. That change was needed and I hope you can see that we are fully committed to build upon our current momentum to deliver for all of our stakeholders. I will now hand it over to our CFO, Cynthia Gaylor, who will walk you through our Q2 financial results and outlook. Cynthia?\nCynthia Gaylor: Great. Thanks, Maggie and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid Q2 and continue to make progress against our top priorities as we drive the business forward. We landed ahead of our expectations for last quarter on multiple fronts. Importantly, we further expanded our customer installed base during the quarter and continue to execute towards our long-term goals, successfully balancing growth with improved profitability. Delivering our customers an unmatched and innovative value proposition will remain our top priority. Our mission is also uniquely aligned with today\u2019s macro backdrop, delighting our customers with high ROI products that are easy to use, efficient in both cost saving and cost effective, all while helping the environment. Let me review some key highlights within our Q2 results. Total revenue increased 22% year-over-year to $622 million, and subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $605 million. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter resulted in a couple of point headwind to total revenue growth, though it was not a meaningful factor in the quarter. Our international revenue grew at 35% year-over-year to reach $154 million in the second quarter and was 25% of our total revenue. Second quarter billings rose 9% year-over-year to $648 million with a 4 quarter rolling average growth of 19%. Customer growth remained strong as we added approximately 44,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total installed base to 1.28 million customers worldwide at the end of Q2, a 22% increase compared to a year ago. This includes approximately 10,000 additional direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 191,000 and 29% year-over-year increase. We saw a 39% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 992 customers. However, while we successfully delivered strong results related to key metrics, we too are seeing more measured buying patterns noted by our peers, coupled with generally longer conversion cycles within some areas of our business. This is more pronounced in real estate and within those verticals exposed to the lending market. However, with our diversified customer base, we saw relative strengthening in technology, food and beverage and manufacturing verticals. It\u2019s also notable that SMB continues to show signs of durability within our direct business with higher relative growth. Enhancing our go-to-market effectiveness also remains a key priority to drive top line growth and ensure solid profitability. While progress in our go-to-market activities will take some time to meaningfully resonate in our quarterly results, we have taken a number of tangible steps to drive future success, including rounding out the leadership team, stabilizing the sales force, aligning sales goals to current expectations and driving accountability throughout the field. Our team is focused on ensuring that customers understand the many ways DocuSign positions them for success over time. Furthermore, innovation across our product portfolio continues to drive future growth and remains core to our differentiation in the marketplace. To share one example from our enterprise business, we recently expanded our relationship with one of Latin America\u2019s leading pulp and paper companies. As an existing eSignature customer, this client expanded its DocuSign footprint by purchasing CLM to digitize their forest departments agreement process. CLM therefore enables our clients to automate various stages of the agreement process, including contract drafting and automatic task delegation, which has since saved hours of valuable time and manual work while mitigating human error. We initially began our relationship with fewer than 50 CLM users. Today, this customer has leveled up to 500 users on our platform. This is one of many examples, which underscores our successful strategy of landing and expanding customers who then grow with us over time in new use cases with new products or features to address their evolving business needs. Another example in core eSignature is a long-term DocuSign customer, a notable clean energy fintech company, which expanded its use of DocuSign to address an important gap in their e-signature experience. Our team identified this customer\u2019s need for increased optimizations in their e-signature journey as many of their customers signed via mobile. We leveraged our unique product and future expansions to ensure that signers now have the appropriate functionality and security through their mobile device. This includes our responsive signing and smart sections viewing features with added security through SMS and ID verification. Now turning back to our Q2 results. We achieved 110% dollar net retention for the quarter, which was slightly below the low end of our 112% to 119% historic range. As we noted last quarter, our customer base continues to expand, however, at a lower rate relative to the peak expansion rates. Given these moderating expansion rates, coupled with the macro environment we\u2019re seeing, we expect our dollar net retention rate for Q3 to remain below the historic range. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 82%, in line with last year, while subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with last year. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit reached $112 million compared with $100 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 18% compared to 19% last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $90 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of last year. As discussed last quarter, we introduced a non-GAAP tax rate in our non-GAAP net income calculation as we reach consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior 3 years. We\u2019re using a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for fiscal \u201823. Q2 non-GAAP EPS is $0.44, which includes the impact of the 20% non-GAAP tax rate. We ended the quarter with 8,061 employees, a 22% increase compared to last year. We have seen attrition rates moderate with new leaders now on board as teams settle in with clearly defined priorities and against the backdrop of a changing macro environment. We are encouraged by the improvements we\u2019re seeing. We exited Q2 with over $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $121 million or 19% margin. This compares with $178 million or a 35% margin for the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $105 million or a 17% margin in the quarter compared to $162 million or 32% in the prior year. We are in the process of implementing a new ERP platform, which will enable improved management of our business as we continue to scale. Looking ahead, Q3 operating cash flow and free cash flow could be impacted by the timing of collections related to our expecting ERP implementation as well as by onetime lease modification expenses. Now turning to our share repurchase program announced earlier this year. We repurchased 400,000 shares during the second quarter for approximately $25 million. As of the end of Q2, we had approximately $175 million in remaining buyback capacity, which demonstrates our confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business and in the opportunities which lie ahead. We remain committed to opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. Taking a step back, we have operating leverage in our business and are evaluating our investments against the vital few priorities we\u2019ve identified, with an eye towards ensuring sustainable growth at scale. We are committed to achieving our long-term target margins of 20% to 25%. To that end, Maggie has charged our leaders with taking a careful look to ensure our teams are aligned to our vital few priorities and to identify areas where our business can be further streamlined and optimized. For example, we are reassessing our overall expense base, which includes a careful review of our people, programs, consultants and T&E spend. Along these lines, we are also taking a measured approach to hiring. And as we progress towards a more scaled model with improved operating efficiencies, investments will continue to be directed toward our systems and tools, specifically ERP as a foundational business system. Further, we\u2019re evaluating our global real estate portfolio to optimize for team collaboration and our physical footprint. This rigor and discipline will ensure we operate from a position of strength and fiscal flexibility. With that, let me now turn to guidance. For the third quarter and fiscal year \u201823, we anticipate total revenue of $624 million to $628 million in Q3 or growth of 14% to 15% year-over-year and $2.47 billion to $2.482 billion for fiscal \u201823 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $609 million to $613 million in Q3 or growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year and $2.405 billion to $2.417 billion for fiscal \u201823 or growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $584 million to $594 million in Q3 or growth of 3% to 5% year-over-year and $2.550 billion to $2.570 billion for fiscal \u201823 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q3 and fiscal \u201823. We expect non-GAAP operating margin at 16% to 18% for Q3 and fiscal \u201823. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income. And as noted last quarter, the fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP tax rate remained at 20%. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $205 million to $210 million for both Q3 and fiscal \u201823. In closing, we delivered a solid Q2 amid a time of transition and despite continued macro headwinds. Our focus as a leadership team remains steadfast in serving our customers, employees and investors as we continue to innovate, build, and position DocuSign for the unmatched opportunity, which the future holds. This quarter has further demonstrated that digital transformation continues to be our customers\u2019 priority and that DocuSign enables the world to nimbly adapt to today\u2019s dynamic environment as once customers move from pen and paper, they don\u2019t go back. We will maintain our disciplined and focused investment approach across our top priorities as we further operationalize the business at scale. We are committed to achieving our long-term operating margin targets while driving sustainable growth with profitability as we navigate the current environment. The progress we have made thus far is gaining traction driven by our team\u2019s commitment to delivering value for our customers and results for our stakeholders. Thanks again for joining us today. With that, operator, we can now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on outperformance in the quarter. I wanted to dig in on some of the categories of expenses that you\u2019re reviewing to make capacity for those needed investments. I mean it seems very broad-based sort of listing people and programs and real estate. I was hoping you could dig into some of the specific areas of spend that will contribute the most to operating efficiency?\nMaggie Wilderotter: Hi, this is Maggie. I just wanted to say that we are in the process right now as a leadership team of identifying what goes underneath each of those broad categories that Cynthia mentioned. So I don\u2019t have a list in front of me that I can say, this, we\u2019re going to do this, this and this. But I will reinforce that there are no expense categories in the company that will not be reviewed for where we can get efficiencies and effectiveness for the business.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then, Maggie, I wanted to ask on the new messaging from a marketing perspective, if you could sort of expand on some of those changes from that marketing message? And that\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Yes. I think one of the things that I\u2019m most excited about and so is the team is to look at the creation of a digital agreement platform versus a focus on a cloud environment. When we think about cloud, cloud is a repository for a lot of different things that don\u2019t necessarily integrate or talk to each other. And what we want is the end-to-end digital agreement to be fully integrated with each of the different capabilities of that agreement as well as with eSignature. So for example, document generation, along with forms or identity or notary or monitor should all be integrated with eSignature. And that also includes our CLM product sets, too. So I think when you think about what we\u2019ve been doing, the elegance of coming to this new way of thinking about the agreement, creates an environment where customers don\u2019t have to go anywhere else for pieces of the agreement platform. They can get it all from DocuSign. And having that end-to-end approach to what we\u2019re doing is something that we\u2019re very excited about and the customers we\u2019ve talked to about it are excited about it as well.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. And I might just elaborate on that a little bit more. I think it\u2019s really about amplifying the key messages that make DocuSign special and really serve our customers. So when you think about our innovation and differentiation, right, we are positioned with customers across the agreement platform, but making sure we really stitch together all the different pieces of the functionality to make it really frictionless for the customer. We also, in today\u2019s environment, with some of the macro headwinds making sure that customers really understand the value proposition, right? We have a very high NPS score with customers in terms of delighting them. It\u2019s easy to use. It reduces friction with their customers, which is why they love using DocuSign. So I think really helping customers understand just the efficiency and effectiveness in the belt-tightening environment that we\u2019re in, our marketing team is really focused on amplifying that because we have very much a land-and-expand model where we start small. We serve some of the smallest customers around the globe and some of the largest, but many of them, regardless of their size, they start small with us and land and expand. And so the value is really there, but I think also just really sharpening our focus in marketing around that. So customers understand that out of the gate is one of those key areas.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about what you\u2019re seeing with customer renewals. There is been some chatter about some down sells just given economic activity is under pressure and customers are optimizing investments. I guess two questions related to that. First, do you feel like you\u2019ve processed most of kind of these renewals at a normalized rate? And secondly, how much of that, if you are \u2013 to the extent you are seeing some compression on the renewals is related to macro factors versus potentially competitive or other factors? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: I\u2019ll take that one. Thank you for the question. So renewals in kind of our book of business is a very important part of the business. And as you know, we\u2019ve doubled the size of the business in a very short period of time going from $1 billion in revenue to over $2 billion. So that renewal piece of the book of business is very important in terms of continuing to scale it, but also it provides a lot of predictability to our business model because we have a large customer base who is using the product. We know once people get on the platform, they are not going back to pen and paper. And because of the land and expand, we really have a lot of operating leverage in that model. That being said, and we talked about this a little bit in the last few quarters, we are seeing smaller expansions, right? So during the peak of the pandemic, the expansions \u2013 we had customers who bought conservatively because they didn\u2019t know how long the pandemic would last. And then they had to expand because things lasted longer than they thought. But also once they started using the product, they were using it in many, many use cases. I think as we got to scale to the place we are now, we\u2019re seeing smaller upsells and expansions as customers continue to consume what they bought and the timing of those renewals also impacts kind of those expansion rates. And you see that a little bit in our dollar net retention metric that\u2019s kind of related to that expansion and renewal base. But we still see a very strong base of renewals expansions within the renewal base. And of course, dollar net retention also reflects any downsized renewals or downsides of churn, but those are \u2013 it\u2019s more of a backward-looking metric than a forward-looking metric. So try to be comprehensive in that answer. Hopefully, that was helpful.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Tyler, is over the last quarter, we have not really had the leadership in the customer success organization because we had a fair amount of turnover. And when we think about customer success at DocuSign, those are our teams that will work with existing customers to expand into use cases in other areas of the business. And so we\u2019re really excited. We have a brand-new Chief Customer Officer, who\u2019s got great operating experience at scale, who has joined the company and just started this week. And one of the priorities we\u2019re doing on the go-forward basis is really getting that muscle back into the upgrade land-and-expand motion that we\u2019ve enjoyed in the past that have really helped us take a small deal that gets done with a customer and expand it throughout an organization. So you\u2019re going to see a lot more focus on that in the second half of the year.\nTyler Radke: That\u2019s helpful. I guess would it be fair to say that you think the worst from a attrition perspective, in terms of employee attrition is behind you? And consequently, how should we think about that layering on of incremental sales capacity and customer support capacity to drive expansion rates over time? In other words, when would you expect that net retention rate to resume towards historical levels? Thank you.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Well, I can say that at this point, we have definitely stabilized the attrition again, by bringing in great scale leaders and having everybody focused on their people as a number one priority in our vital few deliverables. We want to make sure our people are well taken care of, that they have the tools and capabilities to do their jobs, that they understand what\u2019s expected of them from an accountability perspective, and we\u2019re going to measure that success and reward that success. And I truly do believe, too, that we filled in a lot of the blanks over these last several months of key management positions that were left open, especially in the sales and go-to-market, which was necessary for us to fill in order to get the coverage back out with the customer base that we needed. So I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. I also think that there has been some tightening in terms of job availability, especially in the United States and over in certain areas of Europe. That has also enabled us to have a little bit more stability with the current workforce that we have.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed with your question. \nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I just wanted to start out with \u2013 I mean, you talked a lot about some of the cost-cutting measures and being really disciplined. While obviously, I applaud focusing on not wasting money, you\u2019re not a super high cash burner, and it feels like a higher priority might be sales execution, finding new use cases, expanding internationally. So why spend so much management time and attention right now, identifying areas for cost savings, scrutinizing cost savings and for that matter, upgrading or migrating your ERP system as well when realistically, it feels like from my perspective, it should be on sales execution and that kind of stuff and then maybe identify cost savings later? Maybe some color there would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Rishi, thanks for the question. It\u2019s Cynthia here. So a couple of things. I think we\u2019ve always talked about prioritizing growth and we will invest for growth. And so I think part of the initiative right now is making sure that the spend across the company is productive spend and that we\u2019re freeing up resources for growth. And so part of that is we scaled really quickly in a very short period of time, and there were a lot of things we didn\u2019t operationalize efficiently. So I think part of the exercise, it\u2019s partly expense, but it\u2019s also streamlining processes, managing complexity at scale, those types of things. When we look at the go-to-market specifically, there is a focus on the vital few, which begins and ends with selling software and making our customers successful. There is a stabilization of the team there, providing accountability within the field and importantly, aligning goals with the current outlook at the company. So that is very much front and center because at the end of the day, we\u2019re a subscription software company. We\u2019re growing at scale. We want to continue to grow at scale, and we\u2019ve had some speed bumps, right, coming out of the pandemic. So the cost piece of it is really to free up investment to focus on top line growth, but it\u2019s not top line growth at any cost. We\u2019re also very focused on profitability. And as you noted, we have strong cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. And so we would expect that to continue and something we\u2019re monitoring very closely.\nRishi Jaluria: Alright. Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just as I think about the guidance, right, you\u2019re talking about mid-single-digit billings in the near-term, and I guess, turnarounds take time. So maybe help us understand, looking beyond this year, and I\u2019m not asking for guidance for next year, but what sort of underlying growth rates would you be pleased with or happy with? And what are kind of the steps to get from that mid-single-digit level, which if we\u2019re looking at billings as the best leading indicator to a healthier kind of more robust growth rate? Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Thanks, Rishi. So I think we were really pleased to be able to raise the full year guide here in \u2013 for the year, at this point in the year and maintain our margin. And so that\u2019s really based on the progress that we\u2019ve made to date and what we\u2019re seeing in the business. That being said, there is still macro headwinds that are really on a global basis. And our visibility into the business is still not what we would like it to be. So that\u2019s reflected in the guide. But again, we were really pleased to be able to raise the guide for the full year at this point. I think when we look into next year, there is a couple of things that we\u2019re looking at. One is we are encouraged by the progress. I think part of it is next year\u2019s growth will be a function of several factors. Part of it is stabilizing the business and the go-to-market motion, some of the things that Maggie was talking about, and positioning ourselves for further growth headed into fiscal \u201824. Part of that is based on where we land for the year. Part of it will be the AEs and the reps that we brought on board, they need time to ramp, and it\u2019s a multi-quarter process. So that\u2019s in process. And that will be a key factor heading into fiscal \u201824. And then as well, the macro environment will be important there. So I think when we look into next year, there is kind of the importance of where we land. There is the importance of how we set up the capacity model across the field going into next year and really operationalize some of the things that got ahead of us during the peaks of the pandemic and operationalizing those at scale.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Yes. The only thing I would add, Rishi, this is Maggie, is we are also investing and shifting investments into the product roadmap and the product portfolio, not only to get the entire digital agreement platform integrated, but to add enhancements that improve our customer and partner experiences and simplify that. And we\u2019re also looking at the modernization of our product architecture, so we can make changes more quickly and continue to bring out new enhancements with different types of use cases as an example. And we really do believe by driving a product portfolio that can really expand into companies in a very specific way where you have use cases for purchasing versus use cases for human resources, etcetera, we can establish a better alignment with our customers in terms of what they are trying to do with digital transformation. So I really do believe that with the ramp that we\u2019re doing with our sales force, especially with a lot of the new people that we hired, in addition to bringing in people still into the sales organization that are seasoned, scale, the sales executives, that combination will definitely set us up that by the end of the year, we will have a better flywheel of anticipated growth that we will see next year year-over-year.\nRishi Jaluria: Alright. Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. \nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you alluded to a little bit on the previous question, but curious now that you\u2019re several quarters into this effort to pivot back to expansion deals, it sounds like you\u2019re seeing some progress already. Are there any use cases or areas where you\u2019ve seen some early signs of improvement? I know it\u2019s still a work in progress, but any areas that you\u2019ve seen some progress so far? And are there others that we should expect to improve from here?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So we continue to see progress in expansion across the business. In my prepared remarks, I noted two customers. We also have seen some long-term customers even in the financial services segment, which has seen more headwinds in various pockets. But we had a large money manager this last quarter who conservatively bought during the pandemic. They have been a long-term DocuSign customer, but they are experiencing faster digitization and they are further expanding their e-signature footprint with us during the second quarter. So not only do they see heightened demand across their internal business lines, but they have a very trusted relationship with us with their customers in terms of our branded products for their end customers. So they are really using DocuSign to strengthen their own relationships with their end customers. And I think that would be a really great example of strong expansion rates, long-term customer, land and expand a very notable global money manager doing a lot with us in that core eSignature piece. I think there is \u2013 in the \u2013 on CLM, we\u2019ve also seen quite a bit. You may have seen we announced the Slack integration with CLM earlier this week which, again, is really about embedding DocuSign in workflows that already exist, and it\u2019s a key innovative differentiator for us in terms of the AI and analytics around those types of products within workflows that companies are using. So I think that\u2019s another really big opportunity as we continue on the product roadmap and to innovate where customers will see a lot of value and we will see further room for expansion.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Cynthia. And then one more if I may, just on the guidance here for billings. It assumes it looks like a 9% sequential decline. You don\u2019t typically see that decline in billings quarter-on-quarter in Q3. You did last year, but that was also a quarter in which you were experiencing some of these expansion deal softness. So just curious, it sounds like execution is improving here a bit as some of these changes that you put forth are having effect. The macro is moving away a little bit from what\u2019s assumed in the guidance for Q3 in billings? Thank you.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Thank you for the question. So as you know, billings, there is puts and takes in billings, timing of deals, billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter around timing of deals, start dates, when an expansion or add-on happens relative to the timing of the overall contract. A customer may have early renewals also impacts that. I would say Q2 was certainly a little bit stronger than we were anticipating. And so I would say Q2 was probably stronger given some of those factors like timing of deals and start dates. And similarly, I think Q3 just seasonally is not as strong a quarter for us. So, I think that\u2019s embedded. But again, we were really pleased to be able to raise the full year guide range across that metric, but recognize that Q2 to Q3, that dynamic we have seen in the last few years and Q3 tends to not be as strong. The only other thing I would note is we did continue to see softness in linearity within Q2, so as we exited Q2 and entered into Q3. And so that certainly is embedded in the guide just given some of the softness related to macro and then as our field teams ramp.\nBrad Sills: That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks Cynthia.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks. Maybe two, one for Cynthia, one for Maggie. Cynthia, just on the real estate and banking side, perhaps the areas where you are seeing some more pressure, which makes sense given the macro environment. Do you feel like you have better visibility into the companies that perhaps either over-provisioned or \u2013 during COVID, so that you guys have a better sense of where they are at in terms of the usage patterns today versus maybe six months ago when you were sort of just lapping them, it was more uncertain. I was trying to get a sense on just sort of your visibility into that particular part of the business. And then, Maggie, Steve, obviously started, I think, four months, five months ago. I was just kind of curious what he has been doing from a sort of sales organization perspective to try to help get greater cross-selling going in terms of selling the full agreement platform? I think it\u2019s something that sort of got \u2013 people got sidetracked because there is so much demand for eSignature in COVID. So, I was kind of curious if there is anything you are doing in particular around selling the fuller suite from a sales perspective. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure. So, I think on the consumption patterns and cohorts, we do a very detailed analysis on the cohorts and how they are expanding, how they are consuming with our new Success Officer, I think there will be even more focus on some of those metrics at scale. I would say we are still in a period where we don\u2019t have precise visibility across the cohorts in the way that we would like. Part of that is scale, but part of that is during the pandemic, which has really been the last 8 quarters to 10 quarters, different cohorts have expanded at different rates and also within different verticals. So, the one thing I will leave you with there is part of the beauty of our model is the diversification of those cohorts and verticals. And so verticals that maybe were quite strong during the pandemic, we are still seeing expansion, but it would be more in pockets, right. So, the things that are more susceptible to the lending environment may not be as strong now whereas things related to like my money manager, for example, might be showing more strength. Similarly, sectors like food and beverage or technology or even travel and entertainment, manufacturing. Those segments have been growing on a relative basis relative to some of the other ones that were stronger. So, I think part of that is just the diversification of our customer base. And then we will continue to look at kind of the cohorts, but the cohorts don\u2019t show perfect information. I would say they show directional because even within those cohorts you have pockets of different verticals or size of companies that may be having different impacts depending on what\u2019s going on within their sector.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Hi Kirk, this is Maggie. With regard to your question on Steve Shute and the sales organization and their cross-selling and motions, I will say this, Steve has been rebuilding that organization. And part of that rebuild is to really come up with a list of areas of opportunity for us to expand not just in the enterprise space, which is \u2013 has a long sales cycle today. So, one of the things that we are doing differently in enterprise and what we have done before, is I have \u2013 after running a Fortune 500 for many years, I have a very large network at the top of the house for big enterprise customers. And I am opening doors at the CEO level of those companies which also allows us to get in front of the top leaders of the company, i.e., the executive team reporting also to the CEO with the CEO\u2019s help. And that is an ability for us to accelerate going in and looking at an enterprise agreement that\u2019s end-to-end from multiple departments at the same time versus just a land and expand in one certain department. And we give that visibility to those leaders and would be able to get agreements that have more use cases when we get started because we also find with our customers, the more use cases they have, the less likely they are to leave DocuSign or to take business away from us. It really makes them very sticky. So, the other part of that is partnering with our product portfolio folks and within Heather [ph] and her team on making sure that we are coming up with the right capabilities, our product for these customers and APIs for our partner portfolio because in a lot of cases with enterprise, we have SIs and ISVs that have to go in and really help integrate what we are doing with other capabilities that they already have in place at the enterprise level. We have been doing some one-off of that over in the past, which also slows down our implementation. But by being able to get some standardization and how we can expand into enterprise in a faster way has been part of the work that Steve has been doing also over the last couple of months. And just the last thing I will say is we are also taking friction out of the digital motion. We have a lot of customers, millions of customers that come to our website every month in order to sign a document and create a document. And these are usually one-offs. But if you can get more take rate of the folks that visit to do that and completion, there is a lot of money that we can add to the bottom line by doing that in a more frictionless way. And then as Cynthia mentioned, we did have pretty strong small and medium business growth. That\u2019s been a heartbeat for our company for many, many years, and we are going to continue to keep our heads down on what makes sense for the use cases for that set of customers as well.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. Maybe I have got two questions. Cynthia, a few on billings. One is did the large deals you flagged Microsoft and Goldman Sachs, did that have any material impact on either 2Q billings or the second half outlook?\nCynthia Gaylor: Well, so first off say we were very pleased with those deals, but I would say no. We have a very diversified business. So, one or two deals don\u2019t really put us over the edge one way or the other. So, I would say no. But I would say more generally, the timing of deals, the timing of renewals, early renewals or late renewals and start dates can impact billings, but I would not say that those two deals impacted the rate one way or the other.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Yes.\nCynthia Gaylor: Just want to add to that is, for example, like the Goldman Sachs deal was just done in the last week or so. So, they are not implemented yet, either in some cases.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. I just wanted to check. Thank you. And then maybe, Cynthia, just on the fourth quarter billings, if I look at your 3Q guide, look at your full year guide back into implied 4Q billings, it\u2019s $709 million. So, that\u2019s $120 million sequential increase 3Q to 4Q. That\u2019s your strongest ever and much stronger than the prior 4Qs. Is there anything you would help us understand, point to about 4Q, maybe you have got a better renewal base or you are counting on something that might get us comfortable with that outlook? Thanks so much.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Thank you. So, Q4 is seasonally our strongest quarter, and we expect this year to be no different. I think some of the actions that we have been talking about across the go-to-market, we are expecting to see results from the progress that we are making as we move into Q4. Again, we have stabilized the team there. We are making progress with the leaders. We brought in quite a few new leaders in enterprise, commercial, SMB, customer success. And so we would expect, as we move through the year that we will continue to see progress as those teams ramp in addition to Q4 seasonally being a strong quarter for us.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAllan Verkhovski: Hey there. This is Allan Verkhovski on for Alex. Again, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one for me, I wanted to \u2013 if you look at the ARPU for new bookings this quarter and how that compared to last year, would it be the same, higher or lower? And can you further tie this to the level of discounting being done right now by DocuSign as well as competitors, along with any kind of commentary you think is important to flag in the competitive environment right now.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, I would say we don\u2019t look at ARPU in the way you are describing it. But what I can tell you is we do have this land-and-expand model, where customers start out small and expand over time. And we have seen kind of those expansions come in. So, that may be a triangulation on the metric that you are looking at. I think when we look at the competitive environment and pricing and how we think about pricing and packaging, we are always looking to stay competitive in the market, but we also don\u2019t race to the bottom, right. And so our goal is to really serve customers, create value and innovate and then monetize around what customers need and the products and the innovation we have for customers and really reducing the friction there. So, I would say we haven\u2019t seen material changes in the competitive landscape or pricing from that perspective, although our goal is we will compete on the low end, and we compete on the high end given all the differentiation. So, it depends on what customers need, the features, functionality and then how we cross-sell and up-sell products as customers expand. I would also just note, I think our NPS score is quite high and continues to be quite high. And so we really think of that as a metric that\u2019s around delighting our customers the ease of use of what we do even given some of the underbelly of the complexity of the product, I think is really a testament to that high ROI and what customers get from using DocuSign, and we think that\u2019s a big differentiator in the marketplace.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Allan, hi, this is Maggie. Just to put an exclamation point to what Cynthia has just said. With Adobe, for example, we don\u2019t see any real change in that dynamic. We do see at times lower end use cases are the most vulnerable for us. So, we are actually in the process right now of putting in differentiated use case and use case pricing based upon high-end premium use cases and then sort of medium and lower end use cases. And we also think by doing that, it helps to streamline for our customers to do business with us and get the benefits that they are looking for from that price value.\nAllan Verkhovski: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Maggie Wilderotter for closing remarks.\nMaggie Wilderotter: Thank you again, operator, for facilitating for us. And thank you all for joining and for your continued support of DocuSign. I think you can rest assured that the leadership team here in the company will continue to keep our heads down and focused on delivering enhancements and profitability for the company as well as expanding and delighting our customers on a day-to-day basis. We also look forward to providing you with continued updates on our progress. So, thank you again for joining us today.\nCynthia Gaylor: Good-bye.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Maggie Wilderotter",
            "content": "Thanks very much, Heather and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. First, let me introduce myself. I have been on the DocuSign Board for over 5 years and Board Chair for the last few years. In addition to my Board service here at DocuSign, I also sit on several other public and private Boards. I have had the privilege to serve on 51 corporate Boards in my career, 36 public and 15 private, starting at age 28 when I first joined a corporate Board. I also have 18 years of CEO operating experience at private and public companies, and most recently was CEO of a Fortune 500, Frontier Communications, for 12 years, retiring 5 years ago. I have had the privilege in my career to hire and lead great teams, to find clear strategies for success, driving results through clarity of deliverables and accountability. And I have also done so with a maniacal focus on serving customers, both internal and external. I am taking the same approach in my interim role as CEO of DocuSign. Since joining as CEO, I prioritized connecting with customers and employees around the globe through frequent town halls, office visits, virtual connections and in-person meetings. This broad focus on listening, learning and interacting has enabled me to move quickly to set a new agenda for success. We entered Q3 with a clear set of vital few deliverables for our people initiatives, product roadmap and our focus on improving sustainable and profitable growth at scale. 6 of our 8 executive leaders joined during Q2 and are seasoned scale players. They join Cynthia Gaylor, our CFO that you are going to hear from after me and also Shanthi Iyer, our CIO, on the executive leadership team. Our new executive leadership team and I have worked together over the past few weeks to clarify a clear strategic focus and define what is required from all employees for DocuSign to be successful. Let me start with our strategy. DocuSign is the leader in providing end-to-end digital agreements on a fully integrated platform. This starts with delivering simple, intuitive, integrated and trusted customer and partner experiences that remove friction from all steps in creating, using and managing digital agreements. To support this strategy, we have upgraded talent, launched retention initiatives to include a new employee training program that will commence this month teaching our teams how to operate with excellence. Inhi Suh, our new President of Product has already put in place a clear product roadmap that mapped out releases starting next month. Steve Shute, our new President of go-to-market, has revamped our selling motion and performance expectations for the small, medium business and enterprise segments. Our marketing team is delivering new collateral, messaging and tools for Steve's teams as well as a simplified digital motion for consumers and one-time users. Finally, DocuSign has also added two additional seasoned scale leaders. I am pleased that Jennifer Christie is our new Chief Human Resources Officer and veteran Jim Shaughnessy is our new General Counsel. I am privileged to lead such a terrific group of executives who have all hit the ground running by working together with a single focus, set the company on a path for continuous performance improvements in Q3 and Q4 and beyond. I am optimistic about the power of our brand, our value proposition for customers and partners and the renewed results orientation being embraced by our employee base. Finally, the search for our next CEO is a top board priority. All of our independent directors have been actively interviewing great candidates and we are close to making a decision. Terrific candidate pool participating in this process has reinforced the strength of our brand and the shared belief that DocuSign has a tremendous future growth opportunity. I look forward to letting you know who the next CEO will be. With this preface, let me turn to some other Q2 results highlights. As you have seen in our earnings release, Q2 revenue was $622 million, representing a 22% year-over-year increase. We added 44,000 new customers during the quarter, again, a 22% increase year-over-year, which brings our total global paying customer count to 1.28 million. We delivered an 18% operating margin in Q2 as well. The second half of this fiscal year, our goal is to drive operating expense reductions in order to meet the current operating margin guidance range of 16% to 18% that we had previously communicated to you. We are reviewing all categories of expenses and will adjust our spending accordingly. These expected expense reduction initiatives will create capacity for the right investments for our expected scale growth. For example, our IT and internal systems development teams are focused on key automation and software system upgrades, including our planned ERP system cutover this quarter. These enhanced capabilities will enable us to eliminate current manual processes resulting in lower operational costs in the back half of this fiscal year and it will also improve our customer and partner experiences. I am excited to share that we closed a number of large enterprise deals during the quarter that include both Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. In addition, our focus on partner expansion includes a new integration with Stripe to enable users of both product sets to view DocuSign agreements and Stripe payments side by side. Stripe customers can also create new DocuSign agreements directly from Stripe dashboards. This is another strong example of taking friction out of the customer agreement transaction. Over the past few months, with increasing interest rates and inflation on a macroeconomic level, we also have started to see some softness in certain verticals like real estate and financial services. But despite these headwinds, our business model benefits from a well-diversified customer base across industries, geographies and segments. Our products help all of our customers from large to small improve their productivity, be more efficient and improve their time to value creation. In closing, I am honored to continue to lead the DocuSign team until a successor is in place. During this time, we remain committed to stay focused on our vital few priorities, driving profitable growth at scale and delivering further enhancements to the digital agreement platform to delight our customers. We have a $50 billion global market opportunity with an industry leading product and market share position. We will use this position to aggressively expand our capabilities through wise investments, focus and continuous improvement in our performance. DocuSign cannot be successful without strong shareholder support. So let me end my remarks here with thanking all of you for your continued support of our company. We know our results over the previous three quarters did not meet expectations. We got the message. That change was needed and I hope you can see that we are fully committed to build upon our current momentum to deliver for all of our stakeholders. I will now hand it over to our CFO, Cynthia Gaylor, who will walk you through our Q2 financial results and outlook. Cynthia? Hi, this is Maggie. I just wanted to say that we are in the process right now as a leadership team of identifying what goes underneath each of those broad categories that Cynthia mentioned. So I don't have a list in front of me that I can say, this, we're going to do this, this and this. But I will reinforce that there are no expense categories in the company that will not be reviewed for where we can get efficiencies and effectiveness for the business. Yes. I think one of the things that I'm most excited about and so is the team is to look at the creation of a digital agreement platform versus a focus on a cloud environment. When we think about cloud, cloud is a repository for a lot of different things that don't necessarily integrate or talk to each other. And what we want is the end-to-end digital agreement to be fully integrated with each of the different capabilities of that agreement as well as with eSignature. So for example, document generation, along with forms or identity or notary or monitor should all be integrated with eSignature. And that also includes our CLM product sets, too. So I think when you think about what we've been doing, the elegance of coming to this new way of thinking about the agreement, creates an environment where customers don't have to go anywhere else for pieces of the agreement platform. They can get it all from DocuSign. And having that end-to-end approach to what we're doing is something that we're very excited about and the customers we've talked to about it are excited about it as well. Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Tyler, is over the last quarter, we have not really had the leadership in the customer success organization because we had a fair amount of turnover. And when we think about customer success at DocuSign, those are our teams that will work with existing customers to expand into use cases in other areas of the business. And so we're really excited. We have a brand-new Chief Customer Officer, who's got great operating experience at scale, who has joined the company and just started this week. And one of the priorities we're doing on the go-forward basis is really getting that muscle back into the upgrade land-and-expand motion that we've enjoyed in the past that have really helped us take a small deal that gets done with a customer and expand it throughout an organization. So you're going to see a lot more focus on that in the second half of the year. Well, I can say that at this point, we have definitely stabilized the attrition again, by bringing in great scale leaders and having everybody focused on their people as a number one priority in our vital few deliverables. We want to make sure our people are well taken care of, that they have the tools and capabilities to do their jobs, that they understand what's expected of them from an accountability perspective, and we're going to measure that success and reward that success. And I truly do believe, too, that we filled in a lot of the blanks over these last several months of key management positions that were left open, especially in the sales and go-to-market, which was necessary for us to fill in order to get the coverage back out with the customer base that we needed. So I'm cautiously optimistic. I also think that there has been some tightening in terms of job availability, especially in the United States and over in certain areas of Europe. That has also enabled us to have a little bit more stability with the current workforce that we have. Yes. The only thing I would add, Rishi, this is Maggie, is we are also investing and shifting investments into the product roadmap and the product portfolio, not only to get the entire digital agreement platform integrated, but to add enhancements that improve our customer and partner experiences and simplify that. And we're also looking at the modernization of our product architecture, so we can make changes more quickly and continue to bring out new enhancements with different types of use cases as an example. And we really do believe by driving a product portfolio that can really expand into companies in a very specific way where you have use cases for purchasing versus use cases for human resources, etcetera, we can establish a better alignment with our customers in terms of what they are trying to do with digital transformation. So I really do believe that with the ramp that we're doing with our sales force, especially with a lot of the new people that we hired, in addition to bringing in people still into the sales organization that are seasoned, scale, the sales executives, that combination will definitely set us up that by the end of the year, we will have a better flywheel of anticipated growth that we will see next year year-over-year. Hi Kirk, this is Maggie. With regard to your question on Steve Shute and the sales organization and their cross-selling and motions, I will say this, Steve has been rebuilding that organization. And part of that rebuild is to really come up with a list of areas of opportunity for us to expand not just in the enterprise space, which is \u2013 has a long sales cycle today.

            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Maggie and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid Q2 and continue to make progress against our top priorities as we drive the business forward. We landed ahead of our expectations for last quarter on multiple fronts. Importantly, we further expanded our customer installed base during the quarter and continue to execute towards our long-term goals, successfully balancing growth with improved profitability. Delivering our customers an unmatched and innovative value proposition will remain our top priority. Our mission is also uniquely aligned with today's macro backdrop, delighting our customers with high ROI products that are easy to use, efficient in both cost saving and cost effective, all while helping the environment. Let me review some key highlights within our Q2 results. Total revenue increased 22% year-over-year to $622 million, and subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $605 million. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter resulted in a couple of point headwind to total revenue growth, though it was not a meaningful factor in the quarter. Our international revenue grew at 35% year-over-year to reach $154 million in the second quarter and was 25% of our total revenue. Second quarter billings rose 9% year-over-year to $648 million with a 4 quarter rolling average growth of 19%. Customer growth remained strong as we added approximately 44,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total installed base to 1.28 million customers worldwide at the end of Q2, a 22% increase compared to a year ago. This includes approximately 10,000 additional direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 191,000 and 29% year-over-year increase. We saw a 39% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 992 customers. However, while we successfully delivered strong results related to key metrics, we too are seeing more measured buying patterns noted by our peers, coupled with generally longer conversion cycles within some areas of our business. This is more pronounced in real estate and within those verticals exposed to the lending market. However, with our diversified customer base, we saw relative strengthening in technology, food and beverage and manufacturing verticals. It's also notable that SMB continues to show signs of durability within our direct business with higher relative growth. Enhancing our go-to-market effectiveness also remains a key priority to drive top line growth and ensure solid profitability. While progress in our go-to-market activities will take some time to meaningfully resonate in our quarterly results, we have taken a number of tangible steps to drive future success, including rounding out the leadership team, stabilizing the sales force, aligning sales goals to current expectations and driving accountability throughout the field. Our team is focused on ensuring that customers understand the many ways DocuSign positions them for success over time. Furthermore, innovation across our product portfolio continues to drive future growth and remains core to our differentiation in the marketplace. To share one example from our enterprise business, we recently expanded our relationship with one of Latin America's leading pulp and paper companies. As an existing eSignature customer, this client expanded its DocuSign footprint by purchasing CLM to digitize their forest departments agreement process. CLM therefore enables our clients to automate various stages of the agreement process, including contract drafting and automatic task delegation, which has since saved hours of valuable time and manual work while mitigating human error. We initially began our relationship with fewer than 50 CLM users. Today, this customer has leveled up to 500 users on our platform. This is one of many examples, which underscores our successful strategy of landing and expanding customers who then grow with us over time in new use cases with new products or features to address their evolving business needs. Another example in core eSignature is a long-term DocuSign customer, a notable clean energy fintech company, which expanded its use of DocuSign to address an important gap in their e-signature experience. Our team identified this customer's need for increased optimizations in their e-signature journey as many of their customers signed via mobile. We leveraged our unique product and future expansions to ensure that signers now have the appropriate functionality and security through their mobile device. This includes our responsive signing and smart sections viewing features with added security through SMS and ID verification. Now turning back to our Q2 results. We achieved 110% dollar net retention for the quarter, which was slightly below the low end of our 112% to 119% historic range. As we noted last quarter, our customer base continues to expand, however, at a lower rate relative to the peak expansion rates. Given these moderating expansion rates, coupled with the macro environment we're seeing, we expect our dollar net retention rate for Q3 to remain below the historic range. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 82%, in line with last year, while subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with last year. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit reached $112 million compared with $100 million last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 18% compared to 19% last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $90 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of last year. As discussed last quarter, we introduced a non-GAAP tax rate in our non-GAAP net income calculation as we reach consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior 3 years. We're using a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for fiscal \u201823. Q2 non-GAAP EPS is $0.44, which includes the impact of the 20% non-GAAP tax rate. We ended the quarter with 8,061 employees, a 22% increase compared to last year. We have seen attrition rates moderate with new leaders now on board as teams settle in with clearly defined priorities and against the backdrop of a changing macro environment. We are encouraged by the improvements we're seeing. We exited Q2 with over $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $121 million or 19% margin. This compares with $178 million or a 35% margin for the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $105 million or a 17% margin in the quarter compared to $162 million or 32% in the prior year. We are in the process of implementing a new ERP platform, which will enable improved management of our business as we continue to scale. Looking ahead, Q3 operating cash flow and free cash flow could be impacted by the timing of collections related to our expecting ERP implementation as well as by onetime lease modification expenses. Now turning to our share repurchase program announced earlier this year. We repurchased 400,000 shares during the second quarter for approximately $25 million. As of the end of Q2, we had approximately $175 million in remaining buyback capacity, which demonstrates our confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business and in the opportunities which lie ahead. We remain committed to opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. Taking a step back, we have operating leverage in our business and are evaluating our investments against the vital few priorities we've identified, with an eye towards ensuring sustainable growth at scale. We are committed to achieving our long-term target margins of 20% to 25%. To that end, Maggie has charged our leaders with taking a careful look to ensure our teams are aligned to our vital few priorities and to identify areas where our business can be further streamlined and optimized. For example, we are reassessing our overall expense base, which includes a careful review of our people, programs, consultants and T&E spend. Along these lines, we are also taking a measured approach to hiring. And as we progress towards a more scaled model with improved operating efficiencies, investments will continue to be directed toward our systems and tools, specifically ERP as a foundational business system. Further, we're evaluating our global real estate portfolio to optimize for team collaboration and our physical footprint. This rigor and discipline will ensure we operate from a position of strength and fiscal flexibility. With that, let me now turn to guidance. For the third quarter and fiscal year \u201823, we anticipate total revenue of $624 million to $628 million in Q3 or growth of 14% to 15% year-over-year and $2.47 billion to $2.482 billion for fiscal \u201823 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $609 million to $613 million in Q3 or growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year and $2.405 billion to $2.417 billion for fiscal \u201823 or growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $584 million to $594 million in Q3 or growth of 3% to 5% year-over-year and $2.550 billion to $2.570 billion for fiscal \u201823 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q3 and fiscal \u201823. We expect non-GAAP operating margin at 16% to 18% for Q3 and fiscal \u201823. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income. And as noted last quarter, the fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP tax rate remained at 20%. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $205 million to $210 million for both Q3 and fiscal \u201823. In closing, we delivered a solid Q2 amid a time of transition and despite continued macro headwinds. Our focus as a leadership team remains steadfast in serving our customers, employees and investors as we continue to innovate, build, and position DocuSign for the unmatched opportunity, which the future holds. This quarter has further demonstrated that digital transformation continues to be our customers' priority and that DocuSign enables the world to nimbly adapt to today's dynamic environment as once customers move from pen and paper, they don't go back. We will maintain our disciplined and focused investment approach across our top priorities as we further operationalize the business at scale. We are committed to achieving our long-term operating margin targets while driving sustainable growth with profitability as we navigate the current environment. The progress we have made thus far is gaining traction driven by our team's commitment to delivering value for our customers and results for our stakeholders. Thanks again for joining us today. With that, operator, we can now open up the call for questions. Yes. And I might just elaborate on that a little bit more. I think it's really about amplifying the key messages that make DocuSign special and really serve our customers. So when you think about our innovation and differentiation, right, we are positioned with customers across the agreement platform, but making sure we really stitch together all the different pieces of the functionality to make it really frictionless for the customer. We also, in today's environment, with some of the macro headwinds making sure that customers really understand the value proposition, right? We have a very high NPS score with customers in terms of delighting them. It's easy to use. It reduces friction with their customers, which is why they love using DocuSign. So I think really helping customers understand just the efficiency and effectiveness in the belt-tightening environment that we're in, our marketing team is really focused on amplifying that because we have very much a land-and-expand model where we start small. We serve some of the smallest customers around the globe and some of the largest, but many of them, regardless of their size, they start small with us and land and expand. And so the value is really there, but I think also just really sharpening our focus in marketing around that. So customers understand that out of the gate is one of those key areas. I'll take that one. Thank you for the question. So renewals in kind of our book of business is a very important part of the business. And as you know, we've doubled the size of the business in a very short period of time going from $1 billion in revenue to over $2 billion. So that renewal piece of the book of business is very important in terms of continuing to scale it, but also it provides a lot of predictability to our business model because we have a large customer base who is using the product. We know once people get on the platform, they are not going back to pen and paper. And because of the land and expand, we really have a lot of operating leverage in that model. That being said, and we talked about this a little bit in the last few quarters, we are seeing smaller expansions, right? So during the peak of the pandemic, the expansions \u2013 we had customers who bought conservatively because they didn't know how long the pandemic would last. And then they had to expand because things lasted longer than they thought. But also once they started using the product, they were using it in many, many use cases. I think as we got to scale to the place we are now, we're seeing smaller upsells and expansions as customers continue to consume what they bought and the timing of those renewals also impacts kind of those expansion rates. And you see that a little bit in our dollar net retention metric that's kind of related to that expansion and renewal base. But we still see a very strong base of renewals expansions within the renewal base. And of course, dollar net retention also reflects any downsized renewals or downsides of churn, but those are \u2013 it's more of a backward-looking metric than a forward-looking metric. So try to be comprehensive in that answer. Hopefully, that was helpful. Yes. Rishi, thanks for the question. It's Cynthia here. So a couple of things. I think we've always talked about prioritizing growth and we will invest for growth. And so I think part of the initiative right now is making sure that the spend across the company is productive spend and that we're freeing up resources for growth. And so part of that is we scaled really quickly in a very short period of time, and there were a lot of things we didn't operationalize efficiently. So I think part of the exercise, it's partly expense, but it's also streamlining processes, managing complexity at scale, those types of things. When we look at the go-to-market specifically, there is a focus on the vital few, which begins and ends with selling software and making our customers successful. There is a stabilization of the team there, providing accountability within the field and importantly, aligning goals with the current outlook at the company. So that is very much front and center because at the end of the day, we're a subscription software company. We're growing at scale. We want to continue to grow at scale, and we've had some speed bumps, right, coming out of the pandemic. So the cost piece of it is really to free up investment to focus on top line growth, but it's not top line growth at any cost. We're also very focused on profitability. And as you noted, we have strong cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. And so we would expect that to continue and something we're monitoring very closely. Yes. Thanks, Rishi. So I think we were really pleased to be able to raise the full year guide here in \u2013 for the year, at this point in the year and maintain our margin. And so that's really based on the progress that we've made to date and what we're seeing in the business. That being said, there is still macro headwinds that are really on a global basis. And our visibility into the business is still not what we would like it to be. So that's reflected in the guide. But again, we were really pleased to be able to raise the guide for the full year at this point. I think when we look into next year, there is a couple of things that we're looking at. One is we are encouraged by the progress. I think part of it is next year's growth will be a function of several factors. Part of it is stabilizing the business and the go-to-market motion, some of the things that Maggie was talking about, and positioning ourselves for further growth headed into fiscal \u201824. Part of that is based on where we land for the year. Part of it will be the AEs and the reps that we brought on board, they need time to ramp, and it's a multi-quarter process. So that's in process. And that will be a key factor heading into fiscal \u201824. And then as well, the macro environment will be important there. So I think when we look into next year, there is kind of the importance of where we land. There is the importance of how we set up the capacity model across the field going into next year and really operationalize some of the things that got ahead of us during the peaks of the pandemic and operationalizing those at scale. Yes. So we continue to see progress in expansion across the business. In my prepared remarks, I noted two customers. We also have seen some long-term customers even in the financial services segment, which has seen more headwinds in various pockets. But we had a large money manager this last quarter who conservatively bought during the pandemic. They have been a long-term DocuSign customer, but they are experiencing faster digitization and they are further expanding their e-signature footprint with us during the second quarter. So not only do they see heightened demand across their internal business lines, but they have a very trusted relationship with us with their customers in terms of our branded products for their end customers. So they are really using DocuSign to strengthen their own relationships with their end customers. And I think that would be a really great example of strong expansion rates, long-term customer, land and expand a very notable global money manager doing a lot with us in that core eSignature piece. I think there is \u2013 in the \u2013 on CLM, we've also seen quite a bit. You may have seen we announced the Slack integration with CLM earlier this week which, again, is really about embedding DocuSign in workflows that already exist, and it's a key innovative differentiator for us in terms of the AI and analytics around those types of products within workflows that companies are using. So I think that's another really big opportunity as we continue on the product roadmap and to innovate where customers will see a lot of value and we will see further room for expansion. Yes. Thank you for the question. So as you know, billings, there is puts and takes in billings, timing of deals, billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter around timing of deals, start dates, when an expansion or add-on happens relative to the timing of the overall contract. A customer may have early renewals also impacts that. I would say Q2 was certainly a little bit stronger than we were anticipating. And so I would say Q2 was probably stronger given some of those factors like timing of deals and start dates. And similarly, I think Q3 just seasonally is not as strong a quarter for us. So, I think that's embedded. But again, we were really pleased to be able to raise the full year guide range across that metric, but recognize that Q2 to Q3, that dynamic we have seen in the last few years and Q3 tends to not be as strong. The only other thing I would note is we did continue to see softness in linearity within Q2, so as we exited Q2 and entered into Q3. And so that certainly is embedded in the guide just given some of the softness related to macro and then as our field teams ramp. Sure. So, I think on the consumption patterns and cohorts, we do a very detailed analysis on the cohorts and how they are expanding, how they are consuming with our new Success Officer, I think there will be even more focus on some of those metrics at scale. I would say we are still in a period where we don't have precise visibility across the cohorts in the way that we would like. Part of that is scale, but part of that is during the pandemic, which has really been the last 8 quarters to 10 quarters, different cohorts have expanded at different rates and also within different verticals. So, the one thing I will leave you with there is part of the beauty of our model is the diversification of those cohorts and verticals. And so verticals that maybe were quite strong during the pandemic, we are still seeing expansion, but it would be more in pockets, right. So, the things that are more susceptible to the lending environment may not be as strong now whereas things related to like my money manager, for example, might be showing more strength. Similarly, sectors like food and beverage or technology or even travel and entertainment, manufacturing. Those segments have been growing on a relative basis relative to some of the other ones that were stronger. So, I think part of that is just the diversification of our customer base. And then we will continue to look at kind of the cohorts, but the cohorts don't show perfect information. I would say they show directional because even within those cohorts you have pockets of different verticals or size of companies that may be having different impacts depending on what's going on within their sector. Well, so first off say we were very pleased with those deals, but I would say no. We have a very diversified business. So, one or two deals don't really put us over the edge one way or the other. So, I would say no. But I would say more generally, the timing of deals, the timing of renewals, early renewals or late renewals and start dates can impact billings, but I would not say that those two deals impacted the rate one way or the other. Just want to add to that is, for example, like the Goldman Sachs deal was just done in the last week or so. So, they are not implemented yet, either in some cases. Yes, it's a great question. Thank you. So, Q4 is seasonally our strongest quarter, and we expect this year to be no different. I think some of the actions that we have been talking about across the go-to-market, we are expecting to see results from the progress that we are making as we move into Q4. Again, we have stabilized the team there. We are making progress with the leaders. We brought in quite a few new leaders in enterprise, commercial, SMB, customer success. And so we would expect, as we move through the year that we will continue to see progress as those teams ramp in addition to Q4 seasonally being a strong quarter for us. Yes. Thank you for the question. So, I would say we don't look at ARPU in the way you are describing it. But what I can tell you is we do have this land-and-expand model, where customers start out small and expand over time. And we have seen kind of those expansions come in. So, that may be a triangulation on the metric that you are looking at. I think when we look at the competitive environment and pricing and how we think about pricing and packaging, we are always looking to stay competitive in the market, but we also don't race to the bottom, right. And so our goal is to really serve customers, create value and innovate and then monetize around what customers need and the products and the innovation we have for customers and really reducing the friction there. So, I would say we haven't seen material changes in the competitive landscape or pricing from that perspective, although our goal is we will compete on the low end, and we compete on the high end given all the differentiation. So, it depends on what customers need, the features, functionality and then how we cross-sell and up-sell products as customers expand. I would also just note, I think our NPS score is quite high and continues to be quite high. And so we really think of that as a metric that's around delighting our customers the ease of use of what we do even given some of the underbelly of the complexity of the product, I think is really a testament to that high ROI and what customers get from using DocuSign, and we think that's a big differentiator in the marketplace. Good-bye."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Dan Springer. Dan?\nDan Springer: Thanks, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 earnings call today. I want to begin by highlighting some of the quarter's results and then go into some important announcements we made around building a scaled organization and enhancing our DocuSign Agreement Cloud suite of products. DocuSign has begun the year delivering solid results. First quarter revenue was $589 million, representing 25% growth year-over-year. International revenue grew 43% year-over-year, making up 25% of total revenue versus 21% in Q1 of last year. Our billings grew 16% in the quarter, and we delivered dollar net retention of 114%, which is within our historical range. Lastly, we added nearly 67,000 new customers in Q1, an increase of 25% year-over-year, bringing our total to 1.24 million paying customers around the world. These results have required our team's unwavering commitment and flexibility, as we are adapting our go-to-market strategy to the post-pandemic world. Our results also highlight our continued momentum in the digital transformation of Agreement workflows for businesses across the globe. But we are experiencing many of the macro challenges that our peers are seeing, with inflationary concerns, a volatile workforce environment and general global instability, we are ramping our execution and go-to-market capabilities as well as strengthening our leadership team for the growth opportunities ahead. The dynamic macro environment only highlights the need for digital investments like DocuSign, and we will continue to partner with our customers to advance their digital transformation journeys. We're confident in our strategy and path to becoming a $5 billion revenue company. DocuSign continues to be the clear market leader in the electronic signature space, and we are excited about our progress in defining the broader Agreement Cloud category as well. Our dedication to innovation and our investments in attracting high-caliber talent position us to build upon our leading market share. Our plan to scale is well underway, and we are encouraged by the early traction we are seeing. So the level of growth in certain areas is lower than our prior expectations. Let me share some of the specifics with you. In Q1, we made further progress in strengthening the foundation for our next phase of growth; building for scale and tackling the go-to-market challenges we've seen in recent quarters as we transition from the height of the pandemic. Last quarter, I shared that we would be bringing in a world-class sales and success leader and I'm very pleased to note that we made an important hire with Steve Shute, as our new President of Worldwide Field Operations. Also, as I mentioned last quarter, we onboarded a number of outstanding sales leaders in our North American commercial and SMB segments who now have been in their seats for a quarter. Finally, we just hired a new North American enterprise team leader, rounding out our initiative to scale our go-to-market leadership. This seasoned team has hit the ground running, focused on recruiting, training and enablement, and with a laser focus on driving DocuSign to $5 billion in revenue and beyond. We also bolstered a team in other key areas and just announced the appointment of Inhi Cho Suh from IBM, who will transition from being a DocuSign board member to becoming President of Product and Technology, where she will be instrumental in accelerating innovation within our agreement cloud; Jim Shaughnessy, as Chief Legal Officer, previously in that role at Workday; and Jennifer Christie, as Chief People Officer, formerly the CHRO of Twitter. In light of these key hires and with the team we now have in place, we are focused on a second half growth plan that allows us to be successful despite some of the current macro headwinds and gives us a foundation sustainable and predictable growth going into fiscal year 2024. I want to now turn to some noteworthy product callouts. The big announcement in Q1 was our launch of CLM Essentials, a new addition to our expanding family of contract life cycle management products. It's a streamlined CLM solution focused on faster time to value and is built specifically for growing organizations to centralize and automate the creating, negotiating and secure storage of their contracts. Essentials also allows customers to easily accelerate contract work in the quote-to-cash process via deep integration with Salesforce. And as our customers' needs grow, there's a seamless upgrade path to our full CLM or CLM+ products. The other big area of innovation last quarter was in eSignature, where we continue to release a steady pace of features to further simplify and secure Signature workflows. Our latest ID verification feature, enables signers to verify their identity via trusted financial institutions like Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo. This is a great example of how we're continuing our steady pace of innovation where it counts and leading our category as the name in eSignature. And that lead is reflected in our customer metrics. For example, we grew our customers with a greater than $300,000 ACV by 32% from a year ago, as our successes during the quarter demonstrate, we continue to see both growth and leadership in eSignature, as well as progress across the rest of the Agreement Cloud suite. So whether the customers are Fortune 500 or Digital SMBs in our high-growth international markets like Germany or here in the US we see the same land and expand opportunities. The lands tend to start with eSignature, but the expansions are quite varied. Let me share a couple of brief examples. One of the largest multinational payments corporations, who has been a customer for over a decade have steadily and significantly expanded their use of eSignature over the last few quarters. Last quarter, the company deployed a new remote work request system with an eSignature to their over 60,000 global employees. This is aligned with their flexible work-from-home policy, which predates the pandemic. Additionally, this customer recently opened new employee health clinics within each of their main US office locations where they have turned to DocuSign for a streamlined process when using forms within the clinic operations. In Q1, we also saw the continued trend of deeper Agreement Cloud adoption. For example, one of the world's largest and most prestigious global consulting firms made the jump from being a long-time eSignature customer to implementing CLM+ globally. With this move, they can now build and execute standardized end-to-end agreement processes, have centralized document repository with comprehensive metadata and leverage our AI to identify risk levels in previously executed, as well as in-flight agreements. So to summarize, we posted a solid first quarter for fiscal year 2023. We are beginning to see benefits from the optimizations we are making in our go-to-market motions post pandemic and from our new scale, sales and success leadership. While we continue to invest in our employee base to capitalize on the considerable opportunities ahead, we are moderating the tempo of our hiring plans to appropriately balance growth and profitability. With a $50 billion TAM, we have confidence in our business strategy and importantly, the outstanding team we have in place. As we work to build momentum amidst macro headwinds, we're seeing a steady stream of wins and increased interest from our partner ecosystem to build deeper relationships. Just this week, we announced that we are expanding our global strategic partnership with Microsoft to accelerate what we call anywhere work and reinforce the DocuSign Agreement Cloud as a preferred solution within the Microsoft AppSource. We have a deep relationship with Microsoft. We've been a long-standing customer and a partner of DocuSign. We expect to continue to broaden these times and deliver a number of new integrations and capabilities across Microsoft's business solutions, including office, dynamics and the power platform applications. So we have a vast market, the industry-leading product portfolio and a growing world-class team that is focused on driving both growth and margin expansion with discipline and operational excellence. Our plan to reignite enviable growth is underway and progressing. With these objectives plainly insight, I'm optimistic about the future as I've ever been. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Cynthia to walk through our results and outlook in greater detail. Cynthia?\nCynthia Gaylor: Great. Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we delivered a solid Q1 as we continue to focus on execution and delivering on our long-term strategy amid a more challenging macro environment. We made steady progress towards our operating and financial goals added customers at a healthy pace and expanded our international footprint. Let me review some key highlights within our Q1 results. Total revenue increased 25% year-over-year to $589 million and subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $569 million. Our international revenue continued to outpace our domestic growth, with a 43% year-over-year increase to reach $144 million in the first quarter and contributing 25% to total revenue. While the strengthening US dollar caused some FX headwinds during the quarter, the impact to our results was not material. Customer growth remained strong, reflected in approximately 67,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total installed base to nearly 1.24 million customers worldwide at the end of Q1, a 25% increase compared to a year ago. This includes 12,000 additional direct customers, bringing our total direct customer base to 182,000, a 34% increase year-over-year. We saw customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grew 32% year-over-year to a total of 886 customers. We achieved 114% dollar net retention for the quarter, which is within our historic range of 112% to 119%. And while we have added customers at a steady tempo and they continue to expand their usage of DocuSign, they are expanding at a slower rate relative to their peak levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 81% in line with last year, while subscription gross margin was 84% compared with 85% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating profit reached $102 million compared with $93 million last. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17% compared to 20% last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was $77 million compared with $92 million in the first quarter of last year. In light of consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior three years, as of Q1 fiscal 2023, we are including a non-GAAP tax rate in our non-GAAP net income calculation. For fiscal 2023, we are using a projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 20%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. We ended the quarter with 7,642 employees, a 26% increase compared to last year. We exited Q1 with over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow reached all-time highs in Q1 with strong cash collections, building on our strong Q4 finish. Operating cash flow in the first quarter grew 45% year-over-year to $196 million or a 33% margin. This compares with $136 million or 29% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $175 million or a 30% margin in the quarter compared to $123 million or 26% in the prior year, an increase of 42% over last year. We recently moved to accelerate our infrastructure migration to the cloud, as we continue to scale our business and drive efficiency. This move will have minimal in-year financial impact and over time will shift our model away from capital intensive physical data centers to a more flexible and sustainable model at scale. Now let me turn to guidance. As we've indicated, we are confident in our long-term opportunity and in our ability to add new customers and power their digital transformation across the Agreement Cloud with DocuSign. However, we are not immune to the macro challenges with our customers and peer space. As Dan discussed, we are focused on that, which is within our control, innovation across our product portfolio and improving our go-to-market execution. While we have made considerable progress bringing in leaders with significant experience at scale, it's important to recognize that meaningful traction and better visibility will take multiple quarters. We have operating leverage in our business model and are committed to balancing growth with profitability, while also exercising expense discipline. We remain on track to reach our long-term target operating margins. We will continue to make thoughtful and disciplined investments across the company, with a particular focus on our highest priorities, which will drive our growth and success over time. Specifically, in fiscal 2023, we are moderating our expenses and managing our hiring plans at a more measured pace, appropriately aligning our investments with the current climate and our growth. These elements have been incorporated in the current outlook. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2023, we anticipate total revenue of $600 million to $604 million in Q2 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year and $2.47 billion to $2.482 billion for fiscal 2023 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $583 million to $587 million in Q2 or a growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year and 2.394 billion to $2.406 billion for fiscal 2023 or growth of 18% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $599 million to $609 million in Q2, or growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year and $2.521 billion to $2.541 billion for fiscal 2023 or growth of 7% to 8% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q2 and fiscal 2023, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 16% to 18% for Q2 and fiscal 2023. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, and we also expect a tax provision of approximately $7 million to $11 million for fiscal 2023. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $205 million to $210 million for both Q2 and fiscal 2023. In closing, while we are pleased with our Q1 performance, we also acknowledge the work ahead to reaccelerate our growth. The market opportunity is compelling. We have the leading product portfolio and an unwavering focus on driving sustainable growth at scale. We are in a strong position to execute on our go-to-market strategy that will deliver on our commitments to our customers while helping them transform their businesses across the Agreement Cloud. We are taking the necessary steps, and we are confident and energized by the plan we have in place. We're focused on execution and on balancing growth with profitability as we partner with customers to transform how agreements are prepared, signed, acted upon and managed around the world. Thank you for joining us today. With that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great, thank you. Appreciate the question. Wanted to get a better sense kind of just between macro and normalization post-COVID as far as demand and competition that just like what might be impacting the revised outlook, I guess. So first on competition, was wondering if you've picked up any change in win rates or any change in the need to discount pricing? And then, related to macro and COVID normalization, was hoping you could characterize the pipeline. Is it healthy and deals are getting pushed because of macro, or is it a weaker pipeline just given the gap in demand as demand normalizes post the pandemic? Thank you.\nDan Springer: So, a couple of different questions in there. Let me start with your first piece and trying to disaggregate, if you will, sort of global macroeconomic versus the post pandemic impact to DocuSign. It's very difficult, as you would imagine, on the sort of a deal-by-deal basis to do that disaggregation. I think we believe the larger impact for us is coming off the sort of very aggressive buying that we had during COVID. But we also do see, and as we talk to other peer software companies, they're sort of reiterating, particularly in Europe, that there may be some impact there. So it\u2019s very difficult to really quantitatively disaggregate it, but I would say the most substantial piece is coming off the COVID high as opposed to the macroeconomic component. In terms of the competitive set, Cynthia and I do an assessment before every single earnings call, where we sit down with our competitive team and our pricing team, and we have not seen anything substantial that changes. Things are a little bit different in different markets. But in general, we're not seeing any change from a standpoint of thinking about win rates, thinking about the average price that we are achieving. And I'm talking primarily on eSignature here, because it's the largest piece of our business substantially, but that's sort of the core analysis that we dive into. In the standpoint of pipeline, I'd say a couple of things. I would say that we have had a reasonable amount of churn and change in our field organization. Some of that is absolutely attributable to the so-called great resignation. And I think it's consistent with what we're seeing in other software companies. We traditionally had very, very low attrition in our company in single-digit impact to the last couple of years. And we're now sort of more at industry averages, we think. So that's been a big change for us. And I think one of the challenges when you have turnover in the field, it's tougher to build pipeline, right? If you think about most of our revenue in any given period, doesn't come from the NewCo. And as since articulated with very strong NewCo again, which I think is a good testimony to the strength of our business and the value proposition, the strength of our brand is really more on the upsell. And that is where our field, whether that's CSMs or AEs, need to be out with our customers and say, 'Hey, great, you've got good ROI from your first sort of use cases of DocuSign, let's expand into the next one. And what we're seeing is with that change in the team, not as much focus has been on building pipeline. And I would say that would be a factor in the change in guidance for billings that Cindy articulated. Hopefully, that got each of your questions covered.\nJosh Baer: Yes, thanks for the answers. I'll leave it there, since that was three questions already. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. I wanted to ask about some of the execution challenges that you kind of outlined earlier in the call. I think three quarters ago, when you embarked on this refocus on expansion activity, you outlined some stuff being taken there and some changes in leadership. We're now two or three quarters into that. And it looks like this effort is turning out to be a bit more material than perhaps you thought initially. I guess my question is, what are some of the learnings as you pivoted back towards expansion? What's already working? And do you feel like you have the leadership in place now with these changes to be able to continue on that path to kind of refocus on that expansion activity?\nDan Springer: Yes. So first off, I would agree with the assessment that initially probably underestimated, I underestimated sort of the impact in the post-COVID sort of demand acceleration and maybe how dramatic that was. Clearly, we saw that the business growth rate practically doubled, and we doubled the size of the company in sort of like six to seven quarters. So it wasn't that we were not aware of the dramatic economics of it. I think we just didn't understand what portion of that would be things like one-time use cases or an acceleration, where people bought in a more fulsome way. So that the removal of that very, very strong tailwind effectively felt like a headwind. So I think that's absolutely a fair articulation of my misunderstanding of how dramatic that was. Second piece, I think while we talked about the need to sort of enhance and augment the leadership we had for both the scale we've now achieved as well as for this -- the new model going forward. It wasn't really until more recently in the last quarter so that we, in fact, started to bring in the new sales leadership and go-to-market leadership that we talked about earlier on the call. So I'd associate it's fairly early days for most of those leaders. The North American commercial in SMB leaders are just probably about a quarter in. Of course, Steve is just a number of weeks and the new enterprise leader hasn't been -- we just hired hasn't begun yet. So I would say it's still fairly early in the tenure of that augmented leadership. But lastly, I would say, I think in terms of lessons learned, it is that -- the core thing that DocuSign had always done sort of pre-pandemic about really driving customer success, being an organization that's focused on driving adoption and the consumption of what people have purchased are there -- is the core things we need to do. As I mentioned in the last question, we did have reasonable Q1 turnover in our field, which means that we are now onboarding at a higher rate of the number of people we need to fill those slots to drive growth which makes it -- a lot of activity has to be spent on the onboarding and enablement of those folks in sort of the DocuSign way. And that, I think, is probably the biggest single contributor to why it's going to take longer than we would have initially said to get back to the annual growth rates we'd like to see.\nBrad Sills: Thanks for that. And one more, if I may, please. I think you alluded to some early signs of perhaps slowdown in Europe in particular? If you could just articulate a little bit on what you're seeing in the different regions, North America, Europe, Asia with regard to demand, just given all the moving parts of the macro. Thanks, again.\nDan Springer: Sure. Well, I would tell you, overall, international has continued to take share, right, and now up to 25%. So we're quite pleased with the relative growth rate of international and Europe is substantially the largest piece there. But I would say sort of as you move further east across Europe, we've seen probably some stalled and delayed deals where people said, we're not sure what's happening to our economy and want to be maybe a little bit more prudent. So that's where we would probably see the places where sort of the unrest has hit us the most after the war in Ukraine. And I think the German economy is probably the substantial economy that's going to be most impacted across Western Europe. We -- I wouldn't say we've seen anything from the global unrest in other regions like LatAm or APJ. And in terms of the global macro, I don't think we have an ability to really give a huge insight other than saying we just generally see across the board from all regions. A sense of that companies are thinking about inflation, they're thinking about potential looming recession and maybe being more cautious on their buying base.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you, Cynthia, I think everybody just wants to stress test half billings guidance, just to arrive at a viewpoint as to how conservative it is. So I think your second half billings guidance implies $1.31 billion or call it, roughly $650 million in billings per quarter, 3Q and 4Q. I'd just love to ask you what assumptions you're baking into that guidance? What you're assuming in terms of the continuation of the customer hesitation that Dan just flagged, what you're assuming in terms of sales productivity improvements in the third and fourth quarter, just so that we can get an understanding of how conservative it is. Appreciate any color. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. Thanks for the question, Karl. So I mean our guidance philosophy hasn't changed. We guide to what we see and the visibility we have, and we don't have the level of visibility that we would like. However, I would say the philosophy bakes into the risks and opportunities we're seeing in the business. And so some of the things that Dan touched upon in terms of bringing in new leaders, ramping up the field teams, looking at customer demand and use cases and product opportunities within the customers, and then the macro environment that we're seeing, that is baked into our current outlook in the back half of the year.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you, Cynthia.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. If I may, I'll do one for each of you. Dan, why are so many of the reps quitting? I'm sure you've analyzed that. What are sort of the top two reasons? And then, Cynthia, if you have 7% to 8% billings growth this year, doesn't that suggest that you would have sort of 7% to 8% revenue growth next year?\nDan Springer: I'll go in the order you put them out there, Pat. I'd say there's two things. One -- and I do think the most substantial component for us and pretty much everyone I talked to in the software world is this construct that equity values are clearly down pretty much across the board with the reassessment of multiples. And the people live through some tough years in COVID and they're tired and people want to change. And I think the concept that we see a lot of people who have been DocuSigners, the people that have left that have been longer-term DocuSign that I love the culture, I love the place. I just want to change. I'm tired. And it was tough. And there was a lot of hard work in the two years with the big growth, but then it's also difficult to feel like, hey, where the opportunity is not what it felt like it used to be. And so that's probably those conversations. We also had a significant number of people that we added during those two years of the very dramatic COVID growth. And they kind of knew only one DocuSign, which was, quite frankly, achieving the sales success was a heck of a lot easier than it had been previously. And definitely, a lot easier than is now. And for some of those folks, I said, the market is telling me that I can get guaranteed compensation someplace else. And since I'm no longer brand new at DocuSign, I don't have that opportunity. And so from a compensation standpoint, they said, I think I'd be better off trying some place new, particularly a lot of the start-ups, up until at least recently have saying, we'll guarantee your first year of compensation. So, I think those are probably the two biggest drivers that we see for why people would say in the field, I want to try a different sales role.\nCynthia Gaylor: And then the question on the back half of the year. So, we're not guiding\u2014\nPat Walravens: Not the back half of the year, not the back half of the year, sorry, if I wasn\u2019t clear. So, if it's 7% to 8% billings growth for all of fiscal 2023, does that mean fiscal 2024 revenue growth is going to be something like 7% to 8%?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, I mean we're not guiding to next year at this point. I mean, as Dan said, we have new leaders in place. We're ramping the go-to-market. We are guiding for this year to what we're seeing, Pat. And so I think it wouldn't be prudent for us to go beyond this year. We're very encouraged by the steps we've taken. We're very focused on what's in our control, whether that's the innovation, the go-to-market pieces we've talked about, bringing on new team members, kind of, prioritizing the investments, those are the things we're focused on along with, and importantly, making customers successful on the platform so that they can continue to grow and expand with us, right? And so those are the things we're really focused on. And we'll have more to say as we move through the back half of the year, but we're certainly facing headwinds across a few of those different dimensions.\nPat Walravens: Okay. I just figured we might as well get the bad news out now. Isn't that kind of the mechanics of how the business works?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I wouldn't say that's the mechanics. I mean, we're -- every day or every quarter, we're looking to make the right investments to grow the top line across the go-to-market. And so our guide is reflected on what we're seeing in the business. And as I said, as we move through the back half of the year, we're currently anticipating some headwinds relative to what we saw 90 days ago, as we've looked at how the markets have developed and the go-to-market changes that we're making are going to take a little bit longer to actually see in the financial results.\nPat Walravens: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could just touch on how the CLM solution has been tracking? I know you talked about some exciting new product launches. But is that solution seeing the same cross-sell headwinds that Signature is experiencing right now, or are you starting to see some better growth in that segment of the business?\nDan Springer: Yes. CLM, thanks for asking, was a bright spot in Q1. We were over 100% of our goal for what we wanted to see in terms of growth there. As you may recall, CLM had before the pandemic started to look like it was really picking up and then across that entire space of other CLM providers. During the pandemic, it got much tougher as people sort of tried to focus on those shorter-term ROI wins that you see in something like Signature, right, which really took off during the pandemic. And some of those longer cycle deals in CLM where you take more implementation time, you need to have some sort of systems integration work, as a sort of a requirement to execute on installing that software. Now we're seeing that there's a lot of enthusiasm for that. And I would tell you, particularly bright spot is we just launched CLM Essentials, and we already have dozens of wins there with people that are saying, this is the way that says we say, democratize CLM. So we're quite bullish on the momentum that's going there.\nJake Roberge: Great. And then just thinking about international again. So it sounds like EMEA, Eastern Europe might be a little softer. But just curious how you launched in Mexico, three or four quarters, has that geography been tracking as expected? And when we think about the moderation of some of the sales investments you're talking about, will that mainly be international, or will you be moderating investments in the States?\nDan Springer: So the first piece in terms of international, yes, I think your assessment that from the impact from global instability, Eastern Europe would be the area for obvious reasons that would be most impacted. And so then as you move -- I mean, we don't have a significant business -- we have no direct business in the Ukraine or in Russia. And this very small amount of business we've had through our digital, we sort of stopped taking customers in Russia as part of our support for Ukraine. So that's not meaningful in any way. But as you move further into Europe, I suppose we'd say that's probably the most likely impact for that to happen. In terms of other markets, like Mexico and Mexico is very, very early for us, of course, which is a small number of employees there. So it wouldn't be -- have any sort of meaningful impact even in the overall international business in the short run. So I probably wouldn't look to that for an insight there. And I'm sorry, and the last piece, I apologize. You have one last\u2026\nJake Roberge: Yeah. Just in terms of the -- you were talking about moderating some of your investments. And so would that be primarily international?\nDan Springer: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. No, I think the answer is international would probably have less impact, quite frankly. We see that as growing -- continuing to grow and take share as has been our plan to grow faster internationally. So I think when you think about the moderation of hiring, so two things to think about. One, we are committed to deliver on the profitability goals that we've set forward. And if we're going to have any reduction in the top line growth, that we want to make sure we're being thoughtful about the spending level. And, of course, our largest pending item is headcount. We're not doing layoffs. We're not reducing our workforce. We're just tapering the growth rate and the number of hires that we will make. The vast majority of those would be in North America. And the other thing that I would say to that point, one of the challenges we talked about earlier was the fact that there have been heightened attrition, which may be starting to -- again, as a particular the start-up community starts pulling back a little, we may see that get a little bit easier. But our concern was that the amount of new people we were hiring to try to drive that growth rate was just very difficult to onboard them successfully into the company. So the other aspect is in moderating the hiring again, primarily in North America, is to ensure that we can make DocuSigners and bring them on and make them successful for the long-term growth of the company. So that's how I think about those factors.\nJake Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDan Springer: Of course.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Thank you. Cynthia, you talked about some lower visibility in your guidance. And I'm curious what you're assuming for renewal rates and net retention. I know that in the past, you've talked about underestimating the one-time use cases. So are you expecting that churn picks up just as there's maybe more one-time use cases on the platform? And how should we just think about the assumptions on net revenue retention rate relative to your historical range for the back half?\nCynthia Gaylor: Sure, sure. Yeah. So we reported 114, which is within the historic range. For Q2, we're expecting it to be around the low end of the new historic range. Remember, dollar net retention is more of a lagging indicator than a leading indicator, given how the measurements taken off of last year, and the court has snapped on customers, who were customers last year and how they expanded over time. So that metric does include churn. And as you noted, it does factor in if there were one-time use cases, it would be factored into that metric. We're not guiding to the year, but I can tell you, as we usually give color on one quarter out that we are anticipating it to be around the low end of that historic range of 112 to 119.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Thank you. And Dan, you talked about some of the go-to-market changes just as you're looking to reaccelerate growth. And, obviously, you sound like you still believe in a $5 billion target at some point. So, I guess, just how long do you think -- how many quarters will it take to drive that growth back to a level that you're targeting? And where do you aspire the post-pandemic growth rate to be for DocuSign?\nDan Springer: Yes. We don't have long-term growth rate that we've ever put out or published as a perspective. I would tell you this from your core part of your first question is that we've provided guidance today that says, 'Hey, this is probably a longer term set of changes to work those through the field than we initially thought. But if you take a look at sort of the growth in absolute dollars, we want to see that picking up in the second half. We want to see getting impact from the changes that we're making quickly. And I think it would be probably not prudent to say we have a specific date where we think we're kind of there, but rather just say we're going to be making progress. And as we continue to come out of the kind of post-pandemic impact that we talked about in sort of the second half will start to lap those quarters where we were post the most dramatic impact that we had from a tailwind standpoint. I think you'll start to see us getting more and more excited about the growth coming back.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Yeah. Hey, just two for me. I guess I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding. It sounds like most of the issues, Dan, that you guys are talking about, are still to prior point, execution-driven rather than macro-oriented. But then I guess just in the guidance, I think everybody would appreciate a little bit more clarity is -- are you assuming sales cycles lengthen? Are you assuming -- particularly in the US, are you assuming that your retention rate goes down or your churn increases or that small business, the digital portion goes down? I mean we -- I think I appreciate that today, it's -- most companies are talking about Europe, but there's definitely companies that are talking about domestic deals pushing and seeing domestic impact. And then as a follow-up, you talked about the moderating hiring, but I think you reaffirmed your margin targets for the year. So where are we going to -- is there a playbook for a more volatile macro that you're anticipating and planning for from a margin perspective? And where -- if you think about the free cash flow, which a lot of investors focus on for your stock, where is kind of the bottom end of that, that you'd be comfortable with for the year?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yeah. So, let me take some of the guidelines first and then Dan can chime in. So, on sales cycle, we haven't necessarily seen elongated sales cycle. I think the biggest factor that we talked about in the prepared remarks was really around the expansion rate and that customers, which Alex, as you know, customers, we have a land and expand model. Customers start small. They expand over time. That expansion rate and rate of expansion is coming off of the peak levels. And so there are smaller expansions and that is the -- that is a big driver of some of the metrics, whether it's the -- on the growth rates and then on that dollar net retention is the expansion -- the customers are expanding at a smaller rate or slower rate. And so we're focused on things like making sure that we're talking an enabling -- talking to the field and enabling customers around different use cases, different products, future functionalities, selling into different departments as well as landing new customers. And our new customer rate continues to be strong in terms of our net adds. So we're quite pleased with that metric. I think when you think about kind of that back half of the year, we're not guiding on the dollar net retention, but it's fair to say that it is reflected in some of the growth rates and in Q2 we would expect it to be around the bottom end of that historical range. And then hopefully, when we get to next quarter, we'll have better visibility and we'll be able to tell you what it looks like more specifically, but that's kind of where we're at now on that. Dan, maybe you want to talk about the other part.\nDan Springer: Well, just two other pieces, one, I\u2019d just take e a finer point on what Cynthia talked about in terms of the deals. You asked a question around thinking about our field and execution. One of the things I think early on, when we did not see the growth we wanted to see, we sort of looked at that and said to our field, hey, why are we not achieving it? And I think initially put a lot of focus on the fact that we need to sort of sell more. Again, most of the dollars that come in, come from the growth of our existing business, not the NewCo. NewCo, we haven't seen a dramatic change, but we see continue to see very strong numbers there. But as we look deeper into it. From an execution standpoint, we're doing the same number of deals, not that we're not getting deals done. And to your macro question, whether it's Europe or North America, we're not seeing the customers are saying, I don't want to transact with DocuSign. They're saying, 'I bought a lot in the last couple of years, and I'm going to have smaller deal sizes now. And we did not forecast. We thought about the book of business and said, we initially assumed we would grow same percentage we had grown before off that book of business, which was now twice as big as it was before the pandemic. And a lot of our customers said, I'm not going to grow at twice the rate in a dollar standpoint, the same rate that I was growing with you before. And we probably had unreasonable expectation of what the field could deliver on that. But again, this is a deal size as opposed to deals pushing or customers leaving. We're just getting smaller incremental growth because we're one-off a larger base. And two, people had so fulsomely bought during the pandemic time with us. And then just to your margin question, we're actually saying, we're holding our margins. So, we're saying, despite seeing some macro or broader headwinds that other people are also as you said, commenting on other software companies are coming on. We believe, we have a really strong model and we can continue to deliver those margins and that's with an operating income. If you take a look at it from a free cash flow, we had an unbelievably strong quarter in free cash flow. And we expect we're going to continue to have a strong cash generation business because we have a really attractive business model.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Maybe just following up on that answer. From an expansion perspective, is it still to the extent that you have those expand deals that you're in the pipeline contemplating and they're just not occurring, they're taking longer to get done, or these customers are literally saying, we have what we need for indefinite period of time, and now you \u2013 in order to make up for that, you need to land double the volume of new deals.\nDan Springer: So, a couple of thoughts. Across the 1.24 million customers or even 180-odd thousand direct customers, there's no simple answer because we have quite a range of customers, of course, but if I try to think through it on average, it's dramatically more people saying, I only need a little bit more as opposed to a lot more, which I needed last year as opposed to people saying, I'm pushing or deals are taking longer to close. We haven't sort of seen anything significant on that dimension. It is people saying, I've got a lot, I love it. I want more, but just not the same percentage increases I wanted before.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey Dan and Cynthia, thanks for taking my question. I got two here. One, I want to really understand the mechanics of the Q2 billings guidance, right? Because if we look at it, not only is it optically really disappointing at 1% year-over-year, but you're talking about effectively adding $0 in deferred revenue from Q1 to Q2. And I mean, I guess, what assumptions are baked into that? I don't think I've ever seen that historically happen in your business from a Q1 to Q2, where you're adding $0 of net new DR. Was there like some pull-forward business from Q2 that landed in Q1, or what's going on in that guidance? Maybe just help us better understand that. And then I've got a follow-up.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yeah. So it's a good observation. So yes, it's unusual for Q1 to Q2, but we have had other quarters that I would characterize as flattish quarter-on-quarter. So understand, it's unusual for Q1 to Q2. However, remember with billings, there are timing of when deals fall in or out of the quarter. Q1, net-net came out pretty much where we were expecting, but there were definitely puts and takes that was felt in the quarter versus what's felt out the quarter and the impacts on Q2. So I understand your point, but I would just remind you that billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We do look at the trailing four quarter averages on those growth rates. And as we said, we also look at kind of first half, second half. So you can kind of look at first half, second half growth rates and what that implies as well. But understand the question, but I'd just remind you about timing of deals, particularly when it comes to billings, and that's why we tend to look at averages there.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay. So point taken, I get it. But like unless there was an actual pull forward of business from Q2 to Q1, right. The Q2 billings is a \u2013 is a guidance you're giving us, right? It's not a number that's actually happened we can say things moved around. And I guess, I'm still struggling to understand that, but I'll leave that alone. I want to turn to geographies, right? So international growth slowed down that itself is disappointing, but then if I look at the US side of the business that grew 1% \u2013 sorry, 0.6% sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And yet you're talking about being underpenetrated in the market opportunity. Is this just the one-time use cases turning off? Is it \u2013 or what's leading that because we're effectively on the edge of US revenue starting to decline sequentially, right? We're not that far away from that, especially because revenue is a lagging indicator and macro is only going to get worse from here, right, not better. Just help me understand what's going on and how I should be reading that number? Thank you.\nDan Springer: Let me take the first piece, and you can add on, Cynthia. Yeah, I think the answer is I don't want \u2013 I don't want to give you the sense that one-time use cases is substantially the driver, but I would say, it's an absolutely significant contributor. We gave some examples that we talked about before around we had some very large deals around some of the government loans, to be loans that occurred. And our biggest sort of growth in the prior year was in Q1, the PPP loans. So we knew that was going to come to an end, obviously, this quarter, and that was quite substantial. And I would say that other, particularly where interest rates are right now, other loans, which is financial services is a big vertical for us. And as interest rates go up, we would expect that people would do fewer loans in a higher interest rate environment, particularly on the mortgage side. So I think our expectation is that, sort of, a phenomenon from that macro issue that you're describing. But for us, the one-time truly disappearing use case, I think is smaller than the broader component of, hey, we really grew quickly over those two years. And we pulled forward a significant amount of demand where customers wasn't so much DocuSign pushing our customer is saying, 'Hey, we really want to buy in a more fulsome way. And those pieces, I think, in aggregate, are bigger than the actual one-time use cases, but one-time use cases in Q1, Q2, we would say those would be meaningful drivers as well.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. Thank you very much. So, can you describe what areas in field sales needed most improvement? And what actions do you think Steve Shute is going to undertake accordingly?\nDan Springer: Well, and again, I look at it as we try to augment the capabilities that we had there, say there's a couple of things. One was, we just got to a different scale level than we have been, and we had strong -- many, many years of strong growth, but at a much smaller business. And then again, we doubled over sort of six or seven quarters. And if I think we needed to enhance the overall sales leadership that we had, and that is probably around some of the discipline around forecasting and planning is probably the single biggest area. In terms of the actual execution in the field, which we have talked about, I do believe that we had a challenge where we brought in a lot of people in a very hectic environment of growth and did not have the opportunity to enable them for the post pandemic, because they were only here during the pandemic mindset, and it was easier in that period of time. So it's not that all of a sudden our fields became incapable, but we did bring in a lot of people who hadn't worked in a more traditional environment for buying DocuSign. And I think that's the core piece that he's focused on now is that enabling the current force on the DocuSign way. And it is that core land-and-expand model that we talk about, that was sort of back to the basics. And I think Steve is going to do a fantastic job of working with the new sales leadership we brought in, to augment the talent we already had in stronger delivery there.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Dan Springer for any closing comments.\nDan Springer: Thank you very much. As we said, just in summary, we are pleased with the Q1 delivery that we had, but we're really focused and locked in on what we need to do to continue to deliver strong profitability and reigniting the growth that we talk so much about on the call today. We look forward to having the opportunity to speak with you all soon, and thank you very much for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we delivered a solid Q1 as we continue to focus on execution and delivering on our long-term strategy amid a more challenging macro environment. We made steady progress towards our operating and financial goals added customers at a healthy pace and expanded our international footprint. Let me review some key highlights within our Q1 results. Total revenue increased 25% year-over-year to $589 million and subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $569 million. Our international revenue continued to outpace our domestic growth, with a 43% year-over-year increase to reach $144 million in the first quarter and contributing 25% to total revenue. While the strengthening US dollar caused some FX headwinds during the quarter, the impact to our results was not material. Customer growth remained strong, reflected in approximately 67,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total installed base to nearly 1.24 million customers worldwide at the end of Q1, a 25% increase compared to a year ago. This includes 12,000 additional direct customers, bringing our total direct customer base to 182,000, a 34% increase year-over-year. We saw customers with an annual spend greater than $300,000 grew 32% year-over-year to a total of 886 customers. We achieved 114% dollar net retention for the quarter, which is within our historic range of 112% to 119%. And while we have added customers at a steady tempo and they continue to expand their usage of DocuSign, they are expanding at a slower rate relative to their peak levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 81% in line with last year, while subscription gross margin was 84% compared with 85% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating profit reached $102 million compared with $93 million last. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17% compared to 20% last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was $77 million compared with $92 million in the first quarter of last year. In light of consistent non-GAAP profits for the prior three years, as of Q1 fiscal 2023, we are including a non-GAAP tax rate in our non-GAAP net income calculation. For fiscal 2023, we are using a projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 20%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. We ended the quarter with 7,642 employees, a 26% increase compared to last year. We exited Q1 with over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow reached all-time highs in Q1 with strong cash collections, building on our strong Q4 finish. Operating cash flow in the first quarter grew 45% year-over-year to $196 million or a 33% margin. This compares with $136 million or 29% in the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $175 million or a 30% margin in the quarter compared to $123 million or 26% in the prior year, an increase of 42% over last year. We recently moved to accelerate our infrastructure migration to the cloud, as we continue to scale our business and drive efficiency. This move will have minimal in-year financial impact and over time will shift our model away from capital intensive physical data centers to a more flexible and sustainable model at scale. Now let me turn to guidance. As we've indicated, we are confident in our long-term opportunity and in our ability to add new customers and power their digital transformation across the Agreement Cloud with DocuSign. However, we are not immune to the macro challenges with our customers and peer space. As Dan discussed, we are focused on that, which is within our control, innovation across our product portfolio and improving our go-to-market execution. While we have made considerable progress bringing in leaders with significant experience at scale, it's important to recognize that meaningful traction and better visibility will take multiple quarters. We have operating leverage in our business model and are committed to balancing growth with profitability, while also exercising expense discipline. We remain on track to reach our long-term target operating margins. We will continue to make thoughtful and disciplined investments across the company, with a particular focus on our highest priorities, which will drive our growth and success over time. Specifically, in fiscal 2023, we are moderating our expenses and managing our hiring plans at a more measured pace, appropriately aligning our investments with the current climate and our growth. These elements have been incorporated in the current outlook. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2023, we anticipate total revenue of $600 million to $604 million in Q2 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year and $2.47 billion to $2.482 billion for fiscal 2023 or growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $583 million to $587 million in Q2 or a growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year and 2.394 billion to $2.406 billion for fiscal 2023 or growth of 18% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $599 million to $609 million in Q2, or growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year and $2.521 billion to $2.541 billion for fiscal 2023 or growth of 7% to 8% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 79% to 81% for both Q2 and fiscal 2023, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 16% to 18% for Q2 and fiscal 2023. We expect to see a de minimis amount of interest and other income, and we also expect a tax provision of approximately $7 million to $11 million for fiscal 2023. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $205 million to $210 million for both Q2 and fiscal 2023. In closing, while we are pleased with our Q1 performance, we also acknowledge the work ahead to reaccelerate our growth. The market opportunity is compelling. We have the leading product portfolio and an unwavering focus on driving sustainable growth at scale. We are in a strong position to execute on our go-to-market strategy that will deliver on our commitments to our customers while helping them transform their businesses across the Agreement Cloud. We are taking the necessary steps, and we are confident and energized by the plan we have in place. We're focused on execution and on balancing growth with profitability as we partner with customers to transform how agreements are prepared, signed, acted upon and managed around the world. Thank you for joining us today. With that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator? Yes. Thanks for the question, Karl. So I mean our guidance philosophy hasn't changed. We guide to what we see and the visibility we have, and we don't have the level of visibility that we would like. However, I would say the philosophy bakes into the risks and opportunities we're seeing in the business. And so some of the things that Dan touched upon in terms of bringing in new leaders, ramping up the field teams, looking at customer demand and use cases and product opportunities within the customers, and then the macro environment that we're seeing, that is baked into our current outlook in the back half of the year. And then the question on the back half of the year. So, we're not guiding\u2014 Yes. So, I mean we're not guiding to next year at this point. I mean, as Dan said, we have new leaders in place. We're ramping the go-to-market. We are guiding for this year to what we're seeing, Pat. And so I think it wouldn't be prudent for us to go beyond this year. We're very encouraged by the steps we've taken. We're very focused on what's in our control, whether that's the innovation, the go-to-market pieces we've talked about, bringing on new team members, kind of, prioritizing the investments, those are the things we're focused on along with, and importantly, making customers successful on the platform so that they can continue to grow and expand with us, right? And so those are the things we're really focused on. And we'll have more to say as we move through the back half of the year, but we're certainly facing headwinds across a few of those different dimensions. Yes. I wouldn't say that's the mechanics. I mean, we're -- every day or every quarter, we're looking to make the right investments to grow the top line across the go-to-market. And so our guide is reflected on what we're seeing in the business. And as I said, as we move through the back half of the year, we're currently anticipating some headwinds relative to what we saw 90 days ago, as we've looked at how the markets have developed and the go-to-market changes that we're making are going to take a little bit longer to actually see in the financial results. Sure, sure. Yeah. So we reported 114, which is within the historic range. For Q2, we're expecting it to be around the low end of the new historic range. Remember, dollar net retention is more of a lagging indicator than a leading indicator, given how the measurements taken off of last year, and the court has snapped on customers, who were customers last year and how they expanded over time. So that metric does include churn. And as you noted, it does factor in if there were one-time use cases, it would be factored into that metric. We're not guiding to the year, but I can tell you, as we usually give color on one quarter out that we are anticipating it to be around the low end of that historic range of 112 to 119. Yeah. So, let me take some of the guidelines first and then Dan can chime in. So, on sales cycle, we haven't necessarily seen elongated sales cycle. I think the biggest factor that we talked about in the prepared remarks was really around the expansion rate and that customers, which Alex, as you know, customers, we have a land and expand model. Customers start small. They expand over time. That expansion rate and rate of expansion is coming off of the peak levels. And so there are smaller expansions and that is the -- that is a big driver of some of the metrics, whether it's the -- on the growth rates and then on that dollar net retention is the expansion -- the customers are expanding at a smaller rate or slower rate. And so we're focused on things like making sure that we're talking an enabling -- talking to the field and enabling customers around different use cases, different products, future functionalities, selling into different departments as well as landing new customers. And our new customer rate continues to be strong in terms of our net adds. So we're quite pleased with that metric. I think when you think about kind of that back half of the year, we're not guiding on the dollar net retention, but it's fair to say that it is reflected in some of the growth rates and in Q2 we would expect it to be around the bottom end of that historical range. And then hopefully, when we get to next quarter, we'll have better visibility and we'll be able to tell you what it looks like more specifically, but that's kind of where we're at now on that. Dan, maybe you want to talk about the other part. Yeah. So it's a good observation. So yes, it's unusual for Q1 to Q2, but we have had other quarters that I would characterize as flattish quarter-on-quarter. So understand, it's unusual for Q1 to Q2. However, remember with billings, there are timing of when deals fall in or out of the quarter. Q1, net-net came out pretty much where we were expecting, but there were definitely puts and takes that was felt in the quarter versus what's felt out the quarter and the impacts on Q2. So I understand your point, but I would just remind you that billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We do look at the trailing four quarter averages on those growth rates. And as we said, we also look at kind of first half, second half. So you can kind of look at first half, second half growth rates and what that implies as well. But understand the question, but I'd just remind you about timing of deals, particularly when it comes to billings, and that's why we tend to look at averages there."

            "name": "Dan Springer",
            "content": "Thanks, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 earnings call today. I want to begin by highlighting some of the quarter's results and then go into some important announcements we made around building a scaled organization and enhancing our DocuSign Agreement Cloud suite of products. DocuSign has begun the year delivering solid results. First quarter revenue was $589 million, representing 25% growth year-over-year. International revenue grew 43% year-over-year, making up 25% of total revenue versus 21% in Q1 of last year. Our billings grew 16% in the quarter, and we delivered dollar net retention of 114%, which is within our historical range. Lastly, we added nearly 67,000 new customers in Q1, an increase of 25% year-over-year, bringing our total to 1.24 million paying customers around the world. These results have required our team's unwavering commitment and flexibility, as we are adapting our go-to-market strategy to the post-pandemic world. Our results also highlight our continued momentum in the digital transformation of Agreement workflows for businesses across the globe. But we are experiencing many of the macro challenges that our peers are seeing, with inflationary concerns, a volatile workforce environment and general global instability, we are ramping our execution and go-to-market capabilities as well as strengthening our leadership team for the growth opportunities ahead. The dynamic macro environment only highlights the need for digital investments like DocuSign, and we will continue to partner with our customers to advance their digital transformation journeys. We're confident in our strategy and path to becoming a $5 billion revenue company. DocuSign continues to be the clear market leader in the electronic signature space, and we are excited about our progress in defining the broader Agreement Cloud category as well. Our dedication to innovation and our investments in attracting high-caliber talent position us to build upon our leading market share. Our plan to scale is well underway, and we are encouraged by the early traction we are seeing. So the level of growth in certain areas is lower than our prior expectations. Let me share some of the specifics with you. In Q1, we made further progress in strengthening the foundation for our next phase of growth; building for scale and tackling the go-to-market challenges we've seen in recent quarters as we transition from the height of the pandemic. Last quarter, I shared that we would be bringing in a world-class sales and success leader and I'm very pleased to note that we made an important hire with Steve Shute, as our new President of Worldwide Field Operations. Also, as I mentioned last quarter, we onboarded a number of outstanding sales leaders in our North American commercial and SMB segments who now have been in their seats for a quarter. Finally, we just hired a new North American enterprise team leader, rounding out our initiative to scale our go-to-market leadership. This seasoned team has hit the ground running, focused on recruiting, training and enablement, and with a laser focus on driving DocuSign to $5 billion in revenue and beyond. We also bolstered a team in other key areas and just announced the appointment of Inhi Cho Suh from IBM, who will transition from being a DocuSign board member to becoming President of Product and Technology, where she will be instrumental in accelerating innovation within our agreement cloud; Jim Shaughnessy, as Chief Legal Officer, previously in that role at Workday; and Jennifer Christie, as Chief People Officer, formerly the CHRO of Twitter. In light of these key hires and with the team we now have in place, we are focused on a second half growth plan that allows us to be successful despite some of the current macro headwinds and gives us a foundation sustainable and predictable growth going into fiscal year 2024. I want to now turn to some noteworthy product callouts. The big announcement in Q1 was our launch of CLM Essentials, a new addition to our expanding family of contract life cycle management products. It's a streamlined CLM solution focused on faster time to value and is built specifically for growing organizations to centralize and automate the creating, negotiating and secure storage of their contracts. Essentials also allows customers to easily accelerate contract work in the quote-to-cash process via deep integration with Salesforce. And as our customers' needs grow, there's a seamless upgrade path to our full CLM or CLM+ products. The other big area of innovation last quarter was in eSignature, where we continue to release a steady pace of features to further simplify and secure Signature workflows. Our latest ID verification feature, enables signers to verify their identity via trusted financial institutions like Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo. This is a great example of how we're continuing our steady pace of innovation where it counts and leading our category as the name in eSignature. And that lead is reflected in our customer metrics. For example, we grew our customers with a greater than $300,000 ACV by 32% from a year ago, as our successes during the quarter demonstrate, we continue to see both growth and leadership in eSignature, as well as progress across the rest of the Agreement Cloud suite. So whether the customers are Fortune 500 or Digital SMBs in our high-growth international markets like Germany or here in the US we see the same land and expand opportunities. The lands tend to start with eSignature, but the expansions are quite varied. Let me share a couple of brief examples. One of the largest multinational payments corporations, who has been a customer for over a decade have steadily and significantly expanded their use of eSignature over the last few quarters. Last quarter, the company deployed a new remote work request system with an eSignature to their over 60,000 global employees. This is aligned with their flexible work-from-home policy, which predates the pandemic. Additionally, this customer recently opened new employee health clinics within each of their main US office locations where they have turned to DocuSign for a streamlined process when using forms within the clinic operations. In Q1, we also saw the continued trend of deeper Agreement Cloud adoption. For example, one of the world's largest and most prestigious global consulting firms made the jump from being a long-time eSignature customer to implementing CLM+ globally. With this move, they can now build and execute standardized end-to-end agreement processes, have centralized document repository with comprehensive metadata and leverage our AI to identify risk levels in previously executed, as well as in-flight agreements. So to summarize, we posted a solid first quarter for fiscal year 2023. We are beginning to see benefits from the optimizations we are making in our go-to-market motions post pandemic and from our new scale, sales and success leadership. While we continue to invest in our employee base to capitalize on the considerable opportunities ahead, we are moderating the tempo of our hiring plans to appropriately balance growth and profitability. With a $50 billion TAM, we have confidence in our business strategy and importantly, the outstanding team we have in place. As we work to build momentum amidst macro headwinds, we're seeing a steady stream of wins and increased interest from our partner ecosystem to build deeper relationships. Just this week, we announced that we are expanding our global strategic partnership with Microsoft to accelerate what we call anywhere work and reinforce the DocuSign Agreement Cloud as a preferred solution within the Microsoft AppSource. We have a deep relationship with Microsoft. We've been a long-standing customer and a partner of DocuSign. We expect to continue to broaden these times and deliver a number of new integrations and capabilities across Microsoft's business solutions, including office, dynamics and the power platform applications. So we have a vast market, the industry-leading product portfolio and a growing world-class team that is focused on driving both growth and margin expansion with discipline and operational excellence. Our plan to reignite enviable growth is underway and progressing. With these objectives plainly insight, I'm optimistic about the future as I've ever been. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Cynthia to walk through our results and outlook in greater detail. Cynthia? So, a couple of different questions in there. Let me start with your first piece and trying to disaggregate, if you will, sort of global macroeconomic versus the post pandemic impact to DocuSign. It's very difficult, as you would imagine, on the sort of a deal-by-deal basis to do that disaggregation. I think we believe the larger impact for us is coming off the sort of very aggressive buying that we had during COVID. But we also do see, and as we talk to other peer software companies, they're sort of reiterating, particularly in Europe, that there may be some impact there. So it's very difficult to really quantitatively disaggregate it, but I would say the most substantial piece is coming off the COVID high as opposed to the macroeconomic component. In terms of the competitive set, Cynthia and I do an assessment before every single earnings call, where we sit down with our competitive team and our pricing team, and we have not seen anything substantial that changes. Things are a little bit different in different markets. But in general, we're not seeing any change from a standpoint of thinking about win rates, thinking about the average price that we are achieving. And I'm talking primarily on eSignature here, because it's the largest piece of our business substantially, but that's sort of the core analysis that we dive into. In the standpoint of pipeline, I'd say a couple of things. I would say that we have had a reasonable amount of churn and change in our field organization. Some of that is absolutely attributable to the so-called great resignation. And I think it's consistent with what we're seeing in other software companies. We traditionally had very, very low attrition in our company in single-digit impact to the last couple of years. And we're now sort of more at industry averages, we think. So that's been a big change for us. And I think one of the challenges when you have turnover in the field, it's tougher to build pipeline, right? If you think about most of our revenue in any given period, doesn't come from the NewCo. And as since articulated with very strong NewCo again, which I think is a good testimony to the strength of our business and the value proposition, the strength of our brand is really more on the upsell. And that is where our field, whether that's CSMs or AEs, need to be out with our customers and say, 'Hey, great, you've got good ROI from your first sort of use cases of DocuSign, let's expand into the next one. And what we're seeing is with that change in the team, not as much focus has been on building pipeline. And I would say that would be a factor in the change in guidance for billings that Cindy articulated. Hopefully, that got each of your questions covered. Yes. So first off, I would agree with the assessment that initially probably underestimated, I underestimated sort of the impact in the post-COVID sort of demand acceleration and maybe how dramatic that was. Clearly, we saw that the business growth rate practically doubled, and we doubled the size of the company in sort of like six to seven quarters. So it wasn't that we were not aware of the dramatic economics of it. I think we just didn't understand what portion of that would be things like one-time use cases or an acceleration, where people bought in a more fulsome way. So that the removal of that very, very strong tailwind effectively felt like a headwind. So I think that's absolutely a fair articulation of my misunderstanding of how dramatic that was. Second piece, I think while we talked about the need to sort of enhance and augment the leadership we had for both the scale we've now achieved as well as for this -- the new model going forward. It wasn't really until more recently in the last quarter so that we, in fact, started to bring in the new sales leadership and go-to-market leadership that we talked about earlier on the call. So I'd associate it's fairly early days for most of those leaders. The North American commercial in SMB leaders are just probably about a quarter in. Of course, Steve is just a number of weeks and the new enterprise leader hasn't been -- we just hired hasn't begun yet. So I would say it's still fairly early in the tenure of that augmented leadership. But lastly, I would say, I think in terms of lessons learned, it is that -- the core thing that DocuSign had always done sort of pre-pandemic about really driving customer success, being an organization that's focused on driving adoption and the consumption of what people have purchased are there -- is the core things we need to do. As I mentioned in the last question, we did have reasonable Q1 turnover in our field, which means that we are now onboarding at a higher rate of the number of people we need to fill those slots to drive growth which makes it -- a lot of activity has to be spent on the onboarding and enablement of those folks in sort of the DocuSign way. And that, I think, is probably the biggest single contributor to why it's going to take longer than we would have initially said to get back to the annual growth rates we'd like to see. Sure. Well, I would tell you, overall, international has continued to take share, right, and now up to 25%. So we're quite pleased with the relative growth rate of international and Europe is substantially the largest piece there. But I would say sort of as you move further east across Europe, we've seen probably some stalled and delayed deals where people said, we're not sure what's happening to our economy and want to be maybe a little bit more prudent. So that's where we would probably see the places where sort of the unrest has hit us the most after the war in Ukraine. And I think the German economy is probably the substantial economy that's going to be most impacted across Western Europe. We -- I wouldn't say we've seen anything from the global unrest in other regions like LatAm or APJ. And in terms of the global macro, I don't think we have an ability to really give a huge insight other than saying we just generally see across the board from all regions. A sense of that companies are thinking about inflation, they're thinking about potential looming recession and maybe being more cautious on their buying base. I'll go in the order you put them out there, Pat. I'd say there's two things. One -- and I do think the most substantial component for us and pretty much everyone I talked to in the software world is this construct that equity values are clearly down pretty much across the board with the reassessment of multiples. And the people live through some tough years in COVID and they're tired and people want to change. And I think the concept that we see a lot of people who have been DocuSigners, the people that have left that have been longer-term DocuSign that I love the culture, I love the place. I just want to change. I'm tired. And it was tough. And there was a lot of hard work in the two years with the big growth, but then it's also difficult to feel like, hey, where the opportunity is not what it felt like it used to be. And so that's probably those conversations. We also had a significant number of people that we added during those two years of the very dramatic COVID growth. And they kind of knew only one DocuSign, which was, quite frankly, achieving the sales success was a heck of a lot easier than it had been previously. And definitely, a lot easier than is now. And for some of those folks, I said, the market is telling me that I can get guaranteed compensation someplace else. And since I'm no longer brand new at DocuSign, I don't have that opportunity. And so from a compensation standpoint, they said, I think I'd be better off trying some place new, particularly a lot of the start-ups, up until at least recently have saying, we'll guarantee your first year of compensation. So, I think those are probably the two biggest drivers that we see for why people would say in the field, I want to try a different sales role. Yes. CLM, thanks for asking, was a bright spot in Q1. We were over 100% of our goal for what we wanted to see in terms of growth there. As you may recall, CLM had before the pandemic started to look like it was really picking up and then across that entire space of other CLM providers. During the pandemic, it got much tougher as people sort of tried to focus on those shorter-term ROI wins that you see in something like Signature, right, which really took off during the pandemic. And some of those longer cycle deals in CLM where you take more implementation time, you need to have some sort of systems integration work, as a sort of a requirement to execute on installing that software. Now we're seeing that there's a lot of enthusiasm for that. And I would tell you, particularly bright spot is we just launched CLM Essentials, and we already have dozens of wins there with people that are saying, this is the way that says we say, democratize CLM. So we're quite bullish on the momentum that's going there. So the first piece in terms of international, yes, I think your assessment that from the impact from global instability, Eastern Europe would be the area for obvious reasons that would be most impacted. And so then as you move -- I mean, we don't have a significant business -- we have no direct business in the Ukraine or in Russia. And this very small amount of business we've had through our digital, we sort of stopped taking customers in Russia as part of our support for Ukraine. So that's not meaningful in any way. But as you move further into Europe, I suppose we'd say that's probably the most likely impact for that to happen. In terms of other markets, like Mexico and Mexico is very, very early for us, of course, which is a small number of employees there. So it wouldn't be -- have any sort of meaningful impact even in the overall international business in the short run. So I probably wouldn't look to that for an insight there. And I'm sorry, and the last piece, I apologize. You have one last... Yeah, yeah, absolutely. No, I think the answer is international would probably have less impact, quite frankly. We see that as growing -- continuing to grow and take share as has been our plan to grow faster internationally. So I think when you think about the moderation of hiring, so two things to think about. One, we are committed to deliver on the profitability goals that we've set forward. And if we're going to have any reduction in the top line growth, that we want to make sure we're being thoughtful about the spending level. And, of course, our largest pending item is headcount. We're not doing layoffs. We're not reducing our workforce. We're just tapering the growth rate and the number of hires that we will make. The vast majority of those would be in North America. And the other thing that I would say to that point, one of the challenges we talked about earlier was the fact that there have been heightened attrition, which may be starting to -- again, as a particular the start-up community starts pulling back a little, we may see that get a little bit easier. But our concern was that the amount of new people we were hiring to try to drive that growth rate was just very difficult to onboard them successfully into the company. So the other aspect is in moderating the hiring again, primarily in North America, is to ensure that we can make DocuSigners and bring them on and make them successful for the long-term growth of the company. So that's how I think about those factors. Of course. Yes. We don't have long-term growth rate that we've ever put out or published as a perspective. I would tell you this from your core part of your first question is that we've provided guidance today that says, 'Hey, this is probably a longer term set of changes to work those through the field than we initially thought. But if you take a look at sort of the growth in absolute dollars, we want to see that picking up in the second half. We want to see getting impact from the changes that we're making quickly. And I think it would be probably not prudent to say we have a specific date where we think we're kind of there, but rather just say we're going to be making progress. And as we continue to come out of the kind of post-pandemic impact that we talked about in sort of the second half will start to lap those quarters where we were post the most dramatic impact that we had from a tailwind standpoint. I think you'll start to see us getting more and more excited about the growth coming back. Well, just two other pieces, one, I'd just take e a finer point on what Cynthia talked about in terms of the deals. You asked a question around thinking about our field and execution. One of the things I think early on, when we did not see the growth we wanted to see, we sort of looked at that and said to our field, hey, why are we not achieving it? And I think initially put a lot of focus on the fact that we need to sort of sell more. Again, most of the dollars that come in, come from the growth of our existing business, not the NewCo. NewCo, we haven't seen a dramatic change, but we see continue to see very strong numbers there. But as we look deeper into it. From an execution standpoint, we're doing the same number of deals, not that we're not getting deals done. And to your macro question, whether it's Europe or North America, we're not seeing the customers are saying, I don't want to transact with DocuSign. They're saying, 'I bought a lot in the last couple of years, and I'm going to have smaller deal sizes now. And we did not forecast. We thought about the book of business and said, we initially assumed we would grow same percentage we had grown before off that book of business, which was now twice as big as it was before the pandemic. And a lot of our customers said, I'm not going to grow at twice the rate in a dollar standpoint, the same rate that I was growing with you before. And we probably had unreasonable expectation of what the field could deliver on that. But again, this is a deal size as opposed to deals pushing or customers leaving. We're just getting smaller incremental growth because we're one-off a larger base. And two, people had so fulsomely bought during the pandemic time with us. And then just to your margin question, we're actually saying, we're holding our margins. So, we're saying, despite seeing some macro or broader headwinds that other people are also as you said, commenting on other software companies are coming on. We believe, we have a really strong model and we can continue to deliver those margins and that's with an operating income. If you take a look at it from a free cash flow, we had an unbelievably strong quarter in free cash flow. And we expect we're going to continue to have a strong cash generation business because we have a really attractive business model. So, a couple of thoughts. Across the 1.24 million customers or even 180-odd thousand direct customers, there's no simple answer because we have quite a range of customers, of course, but if I try to think through it on average, it's dramatically more people saying, I only need a little bit more as opposed to a lot more, which I needed last year as opposed to people saying, I'm pushing or deals are taking longer to close. We haven't sort of seen anything significant on that dimension. It is people saying, I've got a lot, I love it. I want more, but just not the same percentage increases I wanted before. Let me take the first piece, and you can add on, Cynthia. Yeah, I think the answer is I don't want \u2013 I don't want to give you the sense that one-time use cases is substantially the driver, but I would say, it's an absolutely significant contributor. We gave some examples that we talked about before around we had some very large deals around some of the government loans, to be loans that occurred. And our biggest sort of growth in the prior year was in Q1, the PPP loans. So we knew that was going to come to an end, obviously, this quarter, and that was quite substantial. And I would say that other, particularly where interest rates are right now, other loans, which is financial services is a big vertical for us. And as interest rates go up, we would expect that people would do fewer loans in a higher interest rate environment, particularly on the mortgage side. So I think our expectation is that, sort of, a phenomenon from that macro issue that you're describing. But for us, the one-time truly disappearing use case, I think is smaller than the broader component of, hey, we really grew quickly over those two years. And we pulled forward a significant amount of demand where customers wasn't so much DocuSign pushing our customer is saying, 'Hey, we really want to buy in a more fulsome way. And those pieces, I think, in aggregate, are bigger than the actual one-time use cases, but one-time use cases in Q1, Q2, we would say those would be meaningful drivers as well. Well, and again, I look at it as we try to augment the capabilities that we had there, say there's a couple of things. One was, we just got to a different scale level than we have been, and we had strong -- many, many years of strong growth, but at a much smaller business. And then again, we doubled over sort of six or seven quarters. And if I think we needed to enhance the overall sales leadership that we had, and that is probably around some of the discipline around forecasting and planning is probably the single biggest area. In terms of the actual execution in the field, which we have talked about, I do believe that we had a challenge where we brought in a lot of people in a very hectic environment of growth and did not have the opportunity to enable them for the post pandemic, because they were only here during the pandemic mindset, and it was easier in that period of time. So it's not that all of a sudden our fields became incapable, but we did bring in a lot of people who hadn't worked in a more traditional environment for buying DocuSign. And I think that's the core piece that he's focused on now is that enabling the current force on the DocuSign way. And it is that core land-and-expand model that we talk about, that was sort of back to the basics. And I think Steve is going to do a fantastic job of working with the new sales leadership we brought in, to augment the talent we already had in stronger delivery there. Thank you very much. As we said, just in summary, we are pleased with the Q1 delivery that we had, but we're really focused and locked in on what we need to do to continue to deliver strong profitability and reigniting the growth that we talk so much about on the call today. We look forward to having the opportunity to speak with you all soon, and thank you very much for joining us."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. DocuSign's fourth quarter operating results reflect strong progress across the three pillars of our strategic vision, accelerating product innovation, improving the reach and effectiveness of our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives and strengthening operating and financial efficiency. Before discussing the pillars, I'll briefly highlight Q4's strong business results. Q4 revenue was $712 million, up 8% year-over-year, while full year revenue was $2.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year, both outperformed our expectations. Our continued focus on efficiency while still investing for long-term growth, drove significantly improved profitability. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin rose to 25%, up one point versus last year, while full year non-GAAP operating margin improved by more than five points to 26% from 21% in fiscal '23. In addition, free cash flow more than doubled in fiscal '24 to nearly $900 million. Similar to Q3, we're encouraged by momentum across the business. From solid retention and improving usage with existing customers to strong new customer growth, organizations, large and small, continue to invest in DocuSign's value proposition. Let's turn to our strategic pillars, starting with continued improvement in our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives. In Q4, we were encouraged by improving performance with customers managed by the direct sales force. We substantially increased the amount of business from customers signing and renewing multiyear, multimillion dollar contracts with DocuSign, including Fortune 500 global leaders in energy, industrials, consumer goods, insurance and several federal and state government agencies. Our partner channel has been instrumental in driving large customer momentum. We continue to deepen relationships with strategic, enterprise-focused organizations, including SAP, Microsoft and Deloitte. These organizations are helping to accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. They also represent progress in building a vibrant partner ecosystem to extend DocuSign's reach into new markets and customer segments. To that end, we recently launched global participation in Microsoft Azure's marketplace. We can now co-sell our entire suite of products to Microsoft's enterprise customers who can draw on their existing Azure commitments to purchase DocuSign licenses. We're encouraged to already have our first $1 million customer from that channel. These partners and many more help us accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. We also continue to deliver more efficient customer growth even as we scale. In fiscal '24, we invested to improve our digital and self-serve motions, leading to sustained new customer acquisition growth. In Q4, we surpassed 1.5 million total customers across our digital and direct channels. Our breadth, scale and customer affinity is unique in the broader SaaS landscape and speaks to the continued large opportunity in front of DocuSign. Across our digital direct and partner channels, international continues to be a strong underlying growth driver. In Q4, international revenue grew more than twice as fast as total revenue and now represents more than 27% of the business, up from 25% last year. The international opportunity remains substantial and is one of our key long-term growth drivers. CRESOL, which is a financial cooperative in Brazil, recently adopted the new WhatsApp integration, adding WhatsApp signing to existing e-signature e-mail usage has reduced delays, increased response times and help CRESOL generate more revenue and broaden its reach. Much of CRESOL's credit business is with farmers and the agricultural industry with limited rule connectivity. The DocuSign WhatsApp integration allows CRESOL to bridge that connectivity gap and accelerate its credit process from days to hours. Let's turn to product innovation. Across all aspects of go-to-market, product investment is driving customer adoption. The WhatsApp integration I just mentioned led to significant envelope usage in recent customer wins in Latin America. Over 1,000 customers in UK and Europe have used and now benefit from stronger identity verification products like AI-enabled IDV Premier and our recently launched QES-compliant Identity Wallet. The recent free launch of our premium DocuSign monitor created 1,500 new accounts just this quarter. First Financial Bank, a financial services company headquartered in Indiana is using ID verification, increase the speed of consumer lending and home equity line of credit offerings. This improved security for bank staff removes manual workflows for underwriters and creates a stronger customer experience. First Financial is expanding ID verification to other use cases like credit cards and online account openings. Looking ahead, as we exited Q4, we have several hundred customers in beta in new platform services that will transform DocuSign into a more powerful solution. We'll have much more to share, and we're excited to have you join us virtually to hear about our evolving platform at this year's Momentum Customer Conference in New York on April 11th. Product momentum is clearly creating value for our customers. In fiscal '24, that momentum was validated by third parties like IDC, who named us the e-signature industry leader versus 17 other vendors in its annual worldwide assessment. Also, Gartner named DocuSign as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for contract life cycle management for the fourth year running. To that end, DocuSign CLM customers continue to be at the front line of embracing a broader agreement management use case. In Q4, DocuSign CLM growth once again significantly outpaced overall revenue. This is a positive sign as we see CLM product demand as a precursor to the value we can create across all 1.5 million DocuSign customers. Today, DocuSign CLM helps users automate and manage complex workflows, and we see the future is taking those capabilities to a broader set of users than CLM reaches today. We're seeing strong adoption of our CLM product among enterprise customers. Just this quarter, a luxury automaker used our CLM to create an elegant sales experience to match its brand value proposition. A multibillion dollar global manufacturers sped up its legal and supply chain operations with a company-wide implementation of DocuSign CLM. And a global energy company accelerated its sales processes and streamlined procurement with CLM. Our third strategic pillar is strengthening DocuSign's operating and financial efficiency. In February, we announced further cost management initiatives, including a reduction in force. This decision streamlined our business and focused investments on initiatives that provide the strongest foundation for long-term growth. Blake will share more details on the financial impact and its impact on improving profitability. In fiscal 2025, we will continue focusing on efficiency while investing to reinvigorate long-term growth. In conclusion, fiscal '24 was critical to strengthening DocuSign's foundation. We've reaccelerated product innovation, invested in our leadership talent and rightsized our organization. These are all critical steps to realize the multiyear journey to transform agreement management. And we're just getting started. The opportunity in front of DocuSign remains massive. Today's world runs on agreements, but agreement processes haven't changed in the last 100 years. Even with the evolution to digital documents, agreements and how we use their insights remain relics of antiquated paper-based systems. Sign a document stored as a flat file preserved, but disconnected from the systems that run your operations. Our sole focus is transforming those systems for our 1.5 million existing customers to make agreements more valuable for enterprises and SMBs alike. As organizations transition to a digital world, customers turn to DocuSign as the world's most trusted agreement company. We are excited for fiscal '25 and the continued impact we will have on our customers. Thank you to our incredible team for your passion and dedication to our vision and culture. With that, let me turn it over to Blake.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continue to build a solid foundation on the three pillars of our strategic vision, accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives and strengthening our operating and financial efficiency. As a result, in Q4, we delivered strong operating and financial results. Q4's financial performance exceeded the high end of guidance across every metric, with material improvements in operating income, operating margin and free cash flow. Total revenue in Q4 increased 8% year-over-year to $712 million, and subscription revenue also grew 8% year-over-year to $696 million. Billings of $833 million grew 13% year-over-year, accelerating from 5% year-over-year in Q3. Q4 represented our highest year-over-year billings growth performance in over a year. With respect to billings, approximately half of the eight point acceleration versus Q3 came from solid execution around renewals, especially with large customers. This includes spillovers from the prior quarter and better early renewal strength from contracts that would have otherwise been billed in fiscal year '25. The remaining half came from a strong close to Q4 and net new growth, which will support the business in future quarters. Similar to Q3 results, we are encouraged by continuing signs of stabilization in the business. First, customer usage continues to improve. Total envelope cent increased moderately year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we saw improving year-over-year usage trends in key verticals with technology, insurance, business services, financial services and health care, all growing faster than the total business baseline. Also, consumption with direct customers, our contract utilization measure increased slightly year-over-year. Second, customer retention is stable with positive large customer momentum. Gross retention was flat year-over-year in Q4 across the direct book of business. As expected, dollar net retention trended downward in Q4 to 98%, and we're encouraged that the pace of year-over-year decline slowed substantially in fiscal year '24 versus fiscal year '23. We anticipate the moderating trend to continue in fiscal year '25, and we expect dollar net retention to be flat to down slightly in Q1 '25. While overall net new expansion continues to be impacted by software optimization and macro-related customer purchasing cost and we are encouraged by large customer spending behavior. The number of customers spending over $300,000 annually rose to 1,060 in Q4, increasing sequentially for the second quarter in a row. Also, Q4 bookings for customers with total contract value over $1 million increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Third, new customer acquisition volume remained strong in Q4, partly due to improvement in go-to-market initiatives. DocuSign ended the year with over 1.5 million customers, up 11% year-over-year and consistent with growth in Q3. Direct customers grew 15% year-over-year also consistent with Q3, bringing total direct customers to 242,000. International revenue, a key long-term growth driver, grew at more than double the overall revenue growth rate and is now 27% of total revenue. We believe the international growth opportunity remains large. Also, the scale and breadth of our customer base is unique across the software landscape and an asset we can leverage as we expand our product offerings in the future. Turning to our financials. Operating and financial efficiency initiatives drove strong performance in fiscal year '24. Improved execution led to a significant expansion in operating margin and a more than doubling of free cash flow versus fiscal year '23. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 82.5%, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with the prior year. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margin was 83%, up slightly from last year. Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $178 million, up 15% year-over-year with an operating margin of 25%, improving over 100 basis points year-over-year. We saw a more significant improvement in fiscal year '24, with a record non-GAAP operating income of $711 million, up 38% year-over-year, resulting in a 26% operating margin. This is a substantial increase of over 500 basis points versus 21% in fiscal year '23. We will continue to focus on realizing opportunities to achieve greater efficiency as we invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. Free cash flow improvement was even stronger in Q4 and fiscal year '24. In Q4, free cash flow was $249 million. And for the full year, we generated $887 million in free cash flow, with both periods more than doubling year-over-year, resulting in a 32% free cash flow margin for fiscal year '24. Greater operating efficiency led to a substantial working capital improvement that drove free cash flow yield above our operating profit margin. Going forward, we anticipate free cash flow margin to more closely approximate non-GAAP operating margin. In fiscal year '24, we used a portion of free cash flow to purchase DocuSign shares. We used $146 million towards repurchasing common stock. In addition, we used $144 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact of our equity programs. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for Q4 was $0.76, an $0.11 per share improvement from $0.65 last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal year '24 was $2.98 per share, a $0.95 improvement from $2.03 per share last year. Fiscal year '24 also represented DocuSign's first full year of producing positive GAAP net income. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.36 versus negative $0.49 in the prior year. Going forward, we expect continued improvements in GAAP net income and per share profitability as we work to manage the dilution and cost of our equity programs. We currently expect stock-based compensation to be approximately flat year-over-year in fiscal year '25 and expect SBC as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year. We ended Q4 with 6,840 employees, a 7% decrease year-over-year from 7,336 at the end of fiscal year '23. This results from our ongoing focus on investing efficiently in the business and does not reflect the reduction in force announced on February 6th of this year. We will continue to optimize our hiring plans to align our sales organization with our digital and partner GTM motions, support long-term growth opportunities in R&D and realize efficiencies of scale and G&A. With regard to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we used approximately $690 million of cash to settle our remaining outstanding convertible debt. We currently have no debt on the balance sheet. At the end of fiscal year '24, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This strong financial foundation, including a business model that generates significant free cash flow, supports its future investment and increases our ability to opportunistically return excess capital to shareholders. With that, let me turn to guidance. For Q1 '25 and fiscal year '25, we expect total revenue of $704 million to $708 million in Q1, or a 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For fiscal year '25, we expect revenue between $2.915 billion to $2.927 billion, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $686 million to $690 million in Q1, or an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. And $2.843 billion to $2.855 billion for fiscal '25, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For billings, we expect $685 million to $695 million. And $2.970 to $3.024 billion for fiscal '25. As continually shown in recent quarters and years, billings are heavily impacted by the timing of customer renewals, which can create meaningful variability from period to period. This impacts year-over-year comparisons and is further amplified by the scale of our book of business. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q1 and fiscal '25. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 27% to 28% for Q1, and 26.5% to 28% for fiscal '25. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance includes the impact from the recently announced restructuring of approximately 400 employees or around 6% of our employee base. While we intend to reinvest a small portion of the restructuring savings into the business, primarily in R&D, the vast majority of savings will drop to the bottom line as reflected in our expected operating margin expansion in fiscal year '25. We are committed to improving efficiency while still investing in the areas we believe will drive long-term growth. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 208 million to 213 million for both Q1 and fiscal '25. In closing, we're pleased to report another quarter of progress against our three strategic pillars, accelerating product innovation, enhancing our go-to-market initiatives and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. Q4 execution was particularly strong as the team delivered accelerating billings growth, double-digit customer growth, with improving operating margins and record free cash flow generation. While we still have work ahead to reaccelerate our top line growth, I'm proud of this team for its focus on execution as we continue to be the default trusted partner for customers around agreement management. We have over 1.5 million customers, ranging from the largest enterprises in the world to wide-scale adoption by the small and medium-sized businesses that power the global economy. That scale gives us the opportunity to help customers accelerate their business growth, mitigate risk and enable delightful customer experiences. I'm excited about the opportunity ahead of us and look forward to sharing our progress along the way. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. A couple for Blake, just to kick things off. So Blake, I appreciate the comments on kind of unpacking the Q4 billings outperformance. Obviously, the nine point beat versus the guide was pretty impressive. As I think about the moving pieces on that, could you just help frame the Q1 guide relative to the full year guide on billings. I think the full year would imply you need to grow a little bit faster than you're guiding to on billings in Q1. So curious if some of that's related to the pull forward? And then secondly, how should we think about NRR trends? I think that dipped below 100% at 98%. So as you just think about the drivers between expansions and new business for next year, just help us understand the trajectory of that and how that all fits into the guide. Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And thanks for the question. So to address the question on billings, I think it's helpful to kind of cover it in totality. So starting with Q4 and then going into 2025, because the timing does play a big role as you think about the year-over-year comps. So just to recap quickly, Q4, really pleased with the execution and the acceleration from Q3. And like you heard in the prepared remarks, half of that acceleration was from renewals timing, and that includes early renewals from fiscal year '25. In Q4, our book of renewals have the highest contribution from early renewals for any quarter that we've seen all year long, and that's okay because that's great execution by the team, like we're super happy about that. And then the other half was just from strong net new growth. We had a great close to Q4. And so that was a nice job again by the team there. Now that timing component impacts fiscal '25. So with respect to Q1, and this also applies to Q2, there's -- we've got two hard comps to deal with -- address in this first half of this year. The first is, if you recall, we had really strong on-time renewals in the first half of 2024, that came about because we made some adjustments to our sales incentive plans to improve execution there, and we did, and we did a really good job with it, when you go back and look at our billings performance in the first half of last year or 2024. And then the other hard comp is that Q4 component that I just mentioned that leads to some less spillover into Q1. And so those two hard comps apply, obviously, to the full year as well. So you've got to kind of normalize for that a bit. And so just to give some direction too, as you think about that on a quarterly basis, and you mentioned this about how the full year is a little bit higher than the midpoint guide versus Q1. I expect to see Q2 to decel a bit from Q1, but then reaccelerate into the second half of the year. And again, we got those hard comps that we're dealing with in the first half of this year and then you see that reacceleration. And then you just use your -- that fiscal '25 guide with regards to the magnitude of the quarters. Overall, I'm really pleased with the fiscal '25 billings guide. It's almost exactly $3 billion at the midpoint. But the timing of these renewals makes the year-over-year comps pretty noisy. And so one way that you might think about -- how to think about or try to normalize it is like on a two-year stack view, to normalize for some of those period-over-period components, to kind of normalize for those effects. But I hope that helps just kind of how you think about billings for Q4 and then relative to the full year. And then to your dollar net retention question, we did trend down as we expected, in line with our expectations into Q4. There's still a tough macro environment out there for us where companies are scrutinizing investments, and it just leads to smaller expansion opportunities. Now that said, however, I am quite encouraged by the pace of decline in fiscal '24. It slowed substantially versus fiscal '23. And we're now expecting that the pace of decline is going to slow even further into fiscal '25. And you heard in the prepared remarks, we're actually forecasting for Q1 dollar net retention rate to be flat to down slightly from Q4. And part of that is related to the fact that we're coming out of these COVID comps from prior quarters. And you've heard me talk about how the share of our book of business that was written during kind of the pandemic period is really de minimis now. And so I think that's also one of the things where you can see this flattening out. And again, there's a number of encouraging signs for us around renewal rates and consumption. And then we've got, hopefully, these new product launches releasing into general availability later in the year. And over the long-term, we're excited about our ability to impact that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question\nJake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the great results. Blake, just a follow-up on that DNR remark. Can you help us understand how much of the downtick in that metric was driven by those remaining COVID era contracts that you just called out in your last answer. And then, Allan, it looks like you actually reaccelerated new customer adds this quarter. Do you feel like the 40,000 quarterly adds is the right way to think about the business moving forward? Or could that actually continue to ramp as the macro normalizes, and some of those new product-led growth initiatives take hold?\nBlake Grayson: I'll just take a stab at the DNR follow-up and then Allan take the other one. But we're not breaking out the level of detail and granularity in the DNR from COVID. I think it's just an obvious output where we have some pretty strong expansion in those prior quarters. But that said, we are seeing signs of stabilization in the business. And so it's, I would say, it's definitely not all related to COVID. I don't want to have anybody walk away with that kind of thought process or perspective. But I think it's one of these things that we are seeing stabilizing signs on our business. And we think we have means and mechanisms that we're going to continue to pursue, where we can work to flatten that out that curve and then hopefully improve it over time. But, Allan, on accounts?\nAllan Thygesen: On the second question related to customer acquisition. Yes, I don't know that we track and measure ourselves that directly on that. But I would just say we have a healthy customer acquisition funnel. It is -- there is still white space, particularly internationally and acquiring new customers and we're benefiting from that and I think getting our fair share, although, of course, I always like even more. But I'm not prepared to make any forward-looking statements about the exact number of acquisitions we'll have on a quarterly basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. I want to shift over to margins and profitability. Allan, a question for you. If you could just talk a little bit about the change in investment philosophy from the top. And Blake just wondering the comments around commitment to improving efficiency, does that translate to continued margin expansion even after FY'25 as we think about 2026 and beyond?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So first on our overall investment and expense philosophy. Look, we want to balance solid operational execution and efficiency today with being able to invest for the medium to long-term growth that we think we have in front of us. And so we're balancing that all the time, as we looked at taking the action that Blake referred to at the beginning of February, we felt we had a little more room to get just a little leaner and be ready and still not impair our ability to grow as we launch new products and so on. So that's the balance that we're taking. We will keep looking for opportunities, and it's obviously not all about headcount. We have gotten tremendous efficiency out of the organization on many fronts, that's what produced the strong results that you saw in Q4, really, throughout the year, and the operating cash flow improvements. So we'll keep looking for those opportunities. But we feel we're rightsized for our plan right now. And if we start seeing further investment opportunities, then we will invest, but we do that on a cautious and informed basis.\nBlake Grayson: And then just a follow-up on your question on just margins in the future. I just want to point out that I'm really proud of this team for the efficiencies that we've gained this year. I mean, just specifically, in fiscal '23, our sales and marketing expense was 40% of our revenue. In this year, fiscal '24, it improved to 34%. I expect next year to be in the low 30s. And that's not an easy kind of process to go through. But it's important, and I'm really proud of the focus of the team to address those gains. I think for us in the future, and the future, what I'm talking about is let's talk about long term here now without a time line on it, is that we have opportunities to be able to drive further operating leverage with scaling growth. It's that -- can we grow our revenue faster than we do our expense base? And that's partly what we're building here. And one of the things we're focusing pretty hard on as a team is you hear about PLG motions, and self-service motions and things like that. And I think over the long-term, those opportunities do provide us the opportunity to get better margins into the future, but no specific time line or anything around that.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, that's great. And maybe just as a reminder to the point that they just made about our sales marketing efficiency. The reduction force that we had last February was 95% focused in the sales marketing area. This time around, it was a little bit more balanced, but still were weighted in sales and marketing, reflecting that we felt we had efficiency opportunities throughout the company, and we wanted to make sure we capture those. I think at this point, to the extent we make incremental investments, it will probably be in R&D first. But obviously, as we launch new products, and if -- that we start seeing some leverage there, then we'll not hesitate to invest there as well. Just want to see that first.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Thank you, Blake and Allan for taking my questions. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Wanted to maybe ask first to Allan, if you could just tease out like how much -- it sounds like most of the improvement this quarter was because of better execution versus more macro normalizing. Could you just tease that out and which verticals sort of drove the improvement that you saw. And then Blake, it sounds like free cash flow was really strong this quarter. I guess just talk a little bit more about how you're planning to use that free cash flow specifically for share repurchases.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So I'll go first. We really did see strength across the board. So our cost segments, Blake highlighted that we had progress both on the enterprise side and the SMB side. From a geography perspective, yes, we grew faster internationally, but we did grow everywhere. And on the industry side, we did see a broad-based strength there as well some recovery effects, those mortgages, but we sell to customers in all industries. I highlighted during the full, new significant deals with in manufacturing, in energy and health and so on. There's hardly an industry that doesn't rely on agreements and that therefore, it doesn't represent an opportunity for us. So there really isn't much there. At an overall macro sentiment, I would say, marginally improved from my standpoint. We're not projecting anything more than that looking ahead. As always, we base our plan on current macro conditions. But I think there was a little bit of help across the breadth of our business, but we're almost an index just given the breadth of verticals, segments and countries that we have.\nBlake Grayson: And then to follow up on the second question about free cash flow and how we utilize it. We're in a great spot. We ended the quarter of the year with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. No debt now on the balance sheet. This last -- and also, obviously, we have a foundational business now that generates considerable amount of free cash flow, we use some of that deployed some of that this year for -- like you talked about stock buybacks, but we also use it to retire debt. There's obviously M&A opportunities for us. And we're likely more active than you think we are about looking around what opportunities are available for us. And then there's -- we can invest in the business or you have options for dividends, things like that down the road. I would say that with that kind of stabilizing results and the operating efficiency improvements we feel we can increase our ability to opportunistically return capital to shareholders while still investing in the business. And it's just -- we're committed to increasing the rate with which we return excess capital opportunistically to shareholders, and we'll see how that develops out over the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Fountain: Hi. This is Chris Fountain on for Rishi Jaluria. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about the large customer cohort strength that you saw in the quarter. Is that like better volume and consumption trends? Or is CLM capabilities kind of starting to push some customers over that $300,000 ACV cohort. And then also, I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit more to the R&D investment priorities you mentioned for the coming year? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: I'll take the --\nAllan Thygesen: You take the first one and I'll take the other one.\nBlake Grayson: So, yes, I would say definitely saw improvement in enterprise customers, again, the $300,000 accounts growing sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I'll say that from a renewal rate perspective, enterprise still has room to improve. But I will say that our renewal rates improved sequentially Q3 to Q4 in the enterprise space, more than any other kind of large customer segment that we had, but still room to improve there admittedly. And so we're excited about the opportunities and mostly in R&D, right, that give us those opportunities to provide additional solutions and products to customers. Then I'll let Allan.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. On the R&D investment front, I'd say we've long felt there was an opportunity to reimagine the agreement journey for companies large and small. And we've add solutions for -- at various stages of that journey in the past, obviously, most exemplified by our signature products. In about a month, we will release a broader suite of solutions there, and that there's been a significant investment in that effort during the course of the last fiscal year. And that will continue because we feel we have a multiyear road map of value creation ahead of us there. So that is the biggest investment area. In addition to that, one other area that's getting a meaningful amount of investment is we are moving our platforms to the public cloud, Microsoft Azure, it's underway, and that's a significant effort as well from an infrastructure perspective. Those are the two things I'd highlight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Bergere: Hey, this is Adam Bergere on for Brad. I guess I'd like to start, what are some of the initiatives you are making in terms of like the product-led growth or self-serve missions? And what changes have you made so far there? And what changes do you still want to make?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Let me take that one. So I think during the course of the fiscal year that we just finished here, a lot of our effort was on making the process of buying DocuSign directly from DocuSign, and on our website and in our products much more seamless. And we made substantial improvements there. So much better flows to allow you to easily upgrade solutions to focus on -- put better use of a variety of payment solutions, et cetera. I'd say this year, that will expand beyond the core e-signature products to some of the newer products that we'll be launching and to supporting other channels. Those notably our direct sales channel, we want to offer those customers the ability to self-serve to the greatest extent possible and there will be significant capabilities added there throughout the year. And also for our partners where we have I think, opportunities for meaningful improvement and how easy it is to do business with us. And that's another area we're investing in. So this is across every pillar of our go-to-market effort that has already borne fruit, as you've seen in our digital sales growth, and it will really impact across the business, I think, this year. So very excited about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens JMP. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Cole: Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Austin Cole on for Pat. So last quarter, it seemed like you mentioned that there was kind of an uptick in interest in CLM, and now you're seeing strong adoption of CLM among enterprise customers. Is there kind of an incremental improvement in tone there? Or can you just talk broadly about just the CLM opportunity and how you guys are situated? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So I do think the CLM market overall is improving. And I do think we're executing better in the CLM market. So I think CLM overall, I think more and more companies are realizing that managing your agreements better and getting more value out of them is a very strategic opportunity. It's definitely rising in the priority list. And so CLM, ours and others, is an increasingly strategic and interesting solution. So we're seeing more RFPs and so on. In terms of our competitive position, I think we're in a very strong position as illustrated in the Gartner survey and other measures of our position in the market. I think we are -- we have the largest number of accounts and are very well rated by customers for our experience. And we think there's more opportunity there to, should we say, popularize CLM to a broader audience, both within companies that are -- who are going to adopt it, as well as to smaller companies where the weight of the current solutions might not be appropriate. So it's a very positive and strategic opportunity for us. And yes, I do would summarize that to say on both fronts, some improvement.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. And just a follow-up and maybe to add on to what Allan said. You heard in our prepared remarks, CLM grew faster than the total business and also accelerated from -- on a year-over-year basis from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, it's still a smaller share of our business, but still encouraged by that acceleration for that product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Morelli: This is Rob Morelli on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. Helping [Technical Difficulty] for margin here with non-GAAP operating margins expanding 500 basis points. However, G&A was actually up as a percentage of revenue. Two questions here. First, why were we not able to drive leverage here throughout the year? And then second, how do we think about spend in 2025 in this line of events? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So, yes, G&A expense, non-GAAP G&A was up 14% year-on-year. There's two unique items that are kind of contributing to that. One is, we used to have an immaterial dollar amount, so when you look at a relatively small kind of SEC split out bucket, it has a bit of an effect. So a couple of million dollars, we used to allocate out in the prior year. We're not doing that now, but it's an immaterial kind of dollar amount overall. And then also a little bit higher litigation cost for us this year versus last year. If you exclude those two, what I'll call, unique items, G&A would have grown in the low single-digits year-over-year. So what I would say is from the efforts we've taken over the past few months and recently not only do I expect that sales and marketing expense declined year-on-year as a percentage of revenue, but I also expect to see some efficiencies and improvements in G&A as well. So I think we're focused across this business to drive efficiencies where needed, and I expect to see that next year.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Allan, maybe you could dig in a little bit deeper on the international strength you're seeing. How much of that is being partner-led? What are you seeing from your digital initiatives there? And maybe give us some color on the regional breakdown.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Our international growth is led more by our direct channel today. I think we have very substantial opportunity on the digital front and on the partner side, which is relatively mature right now. I think there's a lot of headroom. So lots of growth opportunity there, but most of the growth today is coming from our direct sales efforts, principally in the larger focused countries. So the top 10 markets outside the US that you would expect. As you know, we've been investing in Japan and Germany. But today, UK, Australia, Canada, France are a little larger than both of those. So all of those markets are priorities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one around your LLM training. I know there was some stuff in the media just regarding privacy. Kind of curious, from your perspective, what are internal policies? And how are you training those LLMs? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I'll take that one. Yes, I want to be very clear. We do not use any customer data for training any of our AI models without specific contractual consent from customers. End of story. So we have a high trust position with customers. They trust us with their most sensitive documents. And we don't want to do anything to violate that trust. There are probably some companies who -- people are willing to move aggressively here, but I think we're moving responsibly and cautiously on that. We are, with all that said, we are very excited about what AI can bring, and our customers are asking us for how can we extract more value from our [indiscernible] using more modern AI technology. And so you'll hear a lot more about that in a month at momentum. But to the point about -- the trust is the starting position. Maybe one other point I'd make is, assuming you give us consent, we then anonymize and aggregate that data so that there is no opportunity for anyone to extract any confidential issues or data out of the agreements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much and congrats on a nice finish to the year. Thinking back to last quarter, you had mentioned the introduction of some new enterprise licensing structures, and there was some comparison, I believe, to ELAs. Wondering if you can shed a bit more light on any changes made there. And when they were implemented? And Blake, did it have any effect on Q4 financial results? For instance, would it change any of the ratios between bookings and billings and recognized revenues or any type of impact to think about from those changes going forward?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, we have done a few deals like that, and I think it will continue to grow with some of our very largest clients. And as we offer a broader set of products, obviously, an enterprise license also becomes more interesting as you can mix and match across products. But it still remains a very small part of the business. We even some of our very largest customers, some of the contract renewals remain on an envelope basis.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. And just to add on top of that, it's -- while we're super excited about the opportunity in very specific cases to consider those, it's not a huge number for us today, it grows. It's continuing to grow. And again, I think, and to directly answer your question, no material impact on our results for Q4. But it's also one of these things, I think, in this business, we have a very, very broad and diverse customer base. And so there's -- we don't have single customers that, I would say, vastly impact us like there might be other companies, which, I think is a strength for us. And so -- but anyways, just to directly answer your question, no material impact.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I would make one other point. ELA has a very specific connotation of sort of unlimited consumption and being able to combine products across. We have leaned in significantly harder to make sure that we are competitive in large enterprise deals. And we did some very large and very nice renewals with some large customers. I think in part as a result of that improved motion. So we have senior people on it. We have our large deal desk. We have all the things that you would expect to make sure that we are as competitive as possible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Berg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Michael Berg on for Michael Turrin. I just wanted to touch on free cash flow. You had a very strong free cash flow generating quarter and year. Maybe you could just shed some light on what drove that? Was it some of the renewal timing you discussed on your -- in terms of billings on the quarter? And how can we think about the relationship between operating margin and free cash flow moving forward? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And so yes, we did have a very strong quarter and year as it regards to free cash flow, we had a 32% free cash flow yield for fiscal '24. And the reason why it's materially higher than our operating margin is frankly, just a working capital tailwind that we had, and it's really driven by two components. One is if you recall about a year ago, we had an ERP implementation that caused a delay in our ability to do some collections. So earlier this year, we've got a tailwind from that. But on top of that, we've also improved our collections process, I would say, extremely well, reduced agings. And so kind of, I would say, just really brought some operational efficiency to our working capital that showed that improvement. Now going forward, as you all know, like being able to repeat working capital improvements on top of each other year-over-year, while we're going to strive to be able to continue to improve and gain efficiencies, it's not something you usually can just get pretty easily. And so that's why in the prepared remarks, you'll find that I would expect longer term to assume a free cash flow yield more closer to that operating margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes -- our final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi. This is Arsenije on for Alex Zukin. Congrats on results. With the international strength you have seen this year, I think it has contributed close to 45% of total revenue growth in fiscal '24. Do you expect this to be an even greater contribution to growth in fiscal '25? Does this mix stay the same? Or as you roll through the drag from the pandemic cohorts early in fiscal '25, do you think that there is strong renewal expansion domestically if macro stays the same, that leads to more US contribution to top line growth in fiscal '25? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. Thanks for the question. Well, first off, again, really happy with how our international growth has progressed to the year, growing much faster than the overall business. All of our major regions grew to the double-digits in Q4. To the question about whether we think it accelerates more or less, I'm not going to provide any guidance out to that. But what I will say is that, just to reiterate, the international opportunity for us, I think, is quite sizable. Only 27% of our revenue in Q4 came from our international business. And if you think of GDP or something as a proxy, it should be, not higher than that. And so I think I'm really excited for that longer-term opportunity, but not any place to say, oh, I think it will accelerate faster or slower than any other market.\nAllan Thygesen: Okay. With that, thank you all for joining and for your support as we continue to build a solid foundation for DocuSign. We are proud of the strong results in Q4 and of the progress that we're making to reinvigorate innovation and add value for our customers, our employees and shareholders. We look forward to what will be a very exciting fiscal 2025. Thank you. We'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continue to build a solid foundation on the three pillars of our strategic vision, accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives and strengthening our operating and financial efficiency. As a result, in Q4, we delivered strong operating and financial results. Q4's financial performance exceeded the high end of guidance across every metric, with material improvements in operating income, operating margin and free cash flow. Total revenue in Q4 increased 8% year-over-year to $712 million, and subscription revenue also grew 8% year-over-year to $696 million. Billings of $833 million grew 13% year-over-year, accelerating from 5% year-over-year in Q3. Q4 represented our highest year-over-year billings growth performance in over a year. With respect to billings, approximately half of the eight point acceleration versus Q3 came from solid execution around renewals, especially with large customers. This includes spillovers from the prior quarter and better early renewal strength from contracts that would have otherwise been billed in fiscal year '25. The remaining half came from a strong close to Q4 and net new growth, which will support the business in future quarters. Similar to Q3 results, we are encouraged by continuing signs of stabilization in the business. First, customer usage continues to improve. Total envelope cent increased moderately year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we saw improving year-over-year usage trends in key verticals with technology, insurance, business services, financial services and health care, all growing faster than the total business baseline. Also, consumption with direct customers, our contract utilization measure increased slightly year-over-year. Second, customer retention is stable with positive large customer momentum. Gross retention was flat year-over-year in Q4 across the direct book of business. As expected, dollar net retention trended downward in Q4 to 98%, and we're encouraged that the pace of year-over-year decline slowed substantially in fiscal year '24 versus fiscal year '23. We anticipate the moderating trend to continue in fiscal year '25, and we expect dollar net retention to be flat to down slightly in Q1 '25. While overall net new expansion continues to be impacted by software optimization and macro-related customer purchasing cost and we are encouraged by large customer spending behavior. The number of customers spending over $300,000 annually rose to 1,060 in Q4, increasing sequentially for the second quarter in a row. Also, Q4 bookings for customers with total contract value over $1 million increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Third, new customer acquisition volume remained strong in Q4, partly due to improvement in go-to-market initiatives. DocuSign ended the year with over 1.5 million customers, up 11% year-over-year and consistent with growth in Q3. Direct customers grew 15% year-over-year also consistent with Q3, bringing total direct customers to 242,000. International revenue, a key long-term growth driver, grew at more than double the overall revenue growth rate and is now 27% of total revenue. We believe the international growth opportunity remains large. Also, the scale and breadth of our customer base is unique across the software landscape and an asset we can leverage as we expand our product offerings in the future. Turning to our financials. Operating and financial efficiency initiatives drove strong performance in fiscal year '24. Improved execution led to a significant expansion in operating margin and a more than doubling of free cash flow versus fiscal year '23. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 82.5%, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with the prior year. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margin was 83%, up slightly from last year. Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $178 million, up 15% year-over-year with an operating margin of 25%, improving over 100 basis points year-over-year. We saw a more significant improvement in fiscal year '24, with a record non-GAAP operating income of $711 million, up 38% year-over-year, resulting in a 26% operating margin. This is a substantial increase of over 500 basis points versus 21% in fiscal year '23. We will continue to focus on realizing opportunities to achieve greater efficiency as we invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. Free cash flow improvement was even stronger in Q4 and fiscal year '24. In Q4, free cash flow was $249 million. And for the full year, we generated $887 million in free cash flow, with both periods more than doubling year-over-year, resulting in a 32% free cash flow margin for fiscal year '24. Greater operating efficiency led to a substantial working capital improvement that drove free cash flow yield above our operating profit margin. Going forward, we anticipate free cash flow margin to more closely approximate non-GAAP operating margin. In fiscal year '24, we used a portion of free cash flow to purchase DocuSign shares. We used $146 million towards repurchasing common stock. In addition, we used $144 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact of our equity programs. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for Q4 was $0.76, an $0.11 per share improvement from $0.65 last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal year '24 was $2.98 per share, a $0.95 improvement from $2.03 per share last year. Fiscal year '24 also represented DocuSign's first full year of producing positive GAAP net income. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.36 versus negative $0.49 in the prior year. Going forward, we expect continued improvements in GAAP net income and per share profitability as we work to manage the dilution and cost of our equity programs. We currently expect stock-based compensation to be approximately flat year-over-year in fiscal year '25 and expect SBC as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year. We ended Q4 with 6,840 employees, a 7% decrease year-over-year from 7,336 at the end of fiscal year '23. This results from our ongoing focus on investing efficiently in the business and does not reflect the reduction in force announced on February 6th of this year. We will continue to optimize our hiring plans to align our sales organization with our digital and partner GTM motions, support long-term growth opportunities in R&D and realize efficiencies of scale and G&A. With regard to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we used approximately $690 million of cash to settle our remaining outstanding convertible debt. We currently have no debt on the balance sheet. At the end of fiscal year '24, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This strong financial foundation, including a business model that generates significant free cash flow, supports its future investment and increases our ability to opportunistically return excess capital to shareholders. With that, let me turn to guidance. For Q1 '25 and fiscal year '25, we expect total revenue of $704 million to $708 million in Q1, or a 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For fiscal year '25, we expect revenue between $2.915 billion to $2.927 billion, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $686 million to $690 million in Q1, or an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. And $2.843 billion to $2.855 billion for fiscal '25, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For billings, we expect $685 million to $695 million. And $2.970 to $3.024 billion for fiscal '25. As continually shown in recent quarters and years, billings are heavily impacted by the timing of customer renewals, which can create meaningful variability from period to period. This impacts year-over-year comparisons and is further amplified by the scale of our book of business. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q1 and fiscal '25. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 27% to 28% for Q1, and 26.5% to 28% for fiscal '25. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance includes the impact from the recently announced restructuring of approximately 400 employees or around 6% of our employee base. While we intend to reinvest a small portion of the restructuring savings into the business, primarily in R&D, the vast majority of savings will drop to the bottom line as reflected in our expected operating margin expansion in fiscal year '25. We are committed to improving efficiency while still investing in the areas we believe will drive long-term growth. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 208 million to 213 million for both Q1 and fiscal '25. In closing, we're pleased to report another quarter of progress against our three strategic pillars, accelerating product innovation, enhancing our go-to-market initiatives and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. Q4 execution was particularly strong as the team delivered accelerating billings growth, double-digit customer growth, with improving operating margins and record free cash flow generation. While we still have work ahead to reaccelerate our top line growth, I'm proud of this team for its focus on execution as we continue to be the default trusted partner for customers around agreement management. We have over 1.5 million customers, ranging from the largest enterprises in the world to wide-scale adoption by the small and medium-sized businesses that power the global economy. That scale gives us the opportunity to help customers accelerate their business growth, mitigate risk and enable delightful customer experiences. I'm excited about the opportunity ahead of us and look forward to sharing our progress along the way. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Sure. And thanks for the question. So to address the question on billings, I think it's helpful to kind of cover it in totality. So starting with Q4 and then going into 2025, because the timing does play a big role as you think about the year-over-year comps. So just to recap quickly, Q4, really pleased with the execution and the acceleration from Q3. And like you heard in the prepared remarks, half of that acceleration was from renewals timing, and that includes early renewals from fiscal year '25. In Q4, our book of renewals have the highest contribution from early renewals for any quarter that we've seen all year long, and that's okay because that's great execution by the team, like we're super happy about that. And then the other half was just from strong net new growth. We had a great close to Q4. And so that was a nice job again by the team there. Now that timing component impacts fiscal '25. So with respect to Q1, and this also applies to Q2, there's -- we've got two hard comps to deal with -- address in this first half of this year. The first is, if you recall, we had really strong on-time renewals in the first half of 2024, that came about because we made some adjustments to our sales incentive plans to improve execution there, and we did, and we did a really good job with it, when you go back and look at our billings performance in the first half of last year or 2024. And then the other hard comp is that Q4 component that I just mentioned that leads to some less spillover into Q1. And so those two hard comps apply, obviously, to the full year as well. So you've got to kind of normalize for that a bit. And so just to give some direction too, as you think about that on a quarterly basis, and you mentioned this about how the full year is a little bit higher than the midpoint guide versus Q1. I expect to see Q2 to decel a bit from Q1, but then reaccelerate into the second half of the year. And again, we got those hard comps that we're dealing with in the first half of this year and then you see that reacceleration. And then you just use your -- that fiscal '25 guide with regards to the magnitude of the quarters. Overall, I'm really pleased with the fiscal '25 billings guide. It's almost exactly $3 billion at the midpoint. But the timing of these renewals makes the year-over-year comps pretty noisy. And so one way that you might think about -- how to think about or try to normalize it is like on a two-year stack view, to normalize for some of those period-over-period components, to kind of normalize for those effects. But I hope that helps just kind of how you think about billings for Q4 and then relative to the full year. And then to your dollar net retention question, we did trend down as we expected, in line with our expectations into Q4. There's still a tough macro environment out there for us where companies are scrutinizing investments, and it just leads to smaller expansion opportunities. Now that said, however, I am quite encouraged by the pace of decline in fiscal '24. It slowed substantially versus fiscal '23. And we're now expecting that the pace of decline is going to slow even further into fiscal '25. And you heard in the prepared remarks, we're actually forecasting for Q1 dollar net retention rate to be flat to down slightly from Q4. And part of that is related to the fact that we're coming out of these COVID comps from prior quarters. And you've heard me talk about how the share of our book of business that was written during kind of the pandemic period is really de minimis now. And so I think that's also one of the things where you can see this flattening out. And again, there's a number of encouraging signs for us around renewal rates and consumption. And then we've got, hopefully, these new product launches releasing into general availability later in the year. And over the long-term, we're excited about our ability to impact that. I'll just take a stab at the DNR follow-up and then Allan take the other one. But we're not breaking out the level of detail and granularity in the DNR from COVID. I think it's just an obvious output where we have some pretty strong expansion in those prior quarters. But that said, we are seeing signs of stabilization in the business. And so it's, I would say, it's definitely not all related to COVID. I don't want to have anybody walk away with that kind of thought process or perspective. But I think it's one of these things that we are seeing stabilizing signs on our business. And we think we have means and mechanisms that we're going to continue to pursue, where we can work to flatten that out that curve and then hopefully improve it over time. But, Allan, on accounts? And then just a follow-up on your question on just margins in the future. I just want to point out that I'm really proud of this team for the efficiencies that we've gained this year. I mean, just specifically, in fiscal '23, our sales and marketing expense was 40% of our revenue. In this year, fiscal '24, it improved to 34%. I expect next year to be in the low 30s. And that's not an easy kind of process to go through. But it's important, and I'm really proud of the focus of the team to address those gains. I think for us in the future, and the future, what I'm talking about is let's talk about long term here now without a time line on it, is that we have opportunities to be able to drive further operating leverage with scaling growth. It's that -- can we grow our revenue faster than we do our expense base? And that's partly what we're building here. And one of the things we're focusing pretty hard on as a team is you hear about PLG motions, and self-service motions and things like that. And I think over the long-term, those opportunities do provide us the opportunity to get better margins into the future, but no specific time line or anything around that. And then to follow up on the second question about free cash flow and how we utilize it. We're in a great spot. We ended the quarter of the year with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. No debt now on the balance sheet. This last -- and also, obviously, we have a foundational business now that generates considerable amount of free cash flow, we use some of that deployed some of that this year for -- like you talked about stock buybacks, but we also use it to retire debt. There's obviously M&A opportunities for us. And we're likely more active than you think we are about looking around what opportunities are available for us. And then there's -- we can invest in the business or you have options for dividends, things like that down the road. I would say that with that kind of stabilizing results and the operating efficiency improvements we feel we can increase our ability to opportunistically return capital to shareholders while still investing in the business. And it's just -- we're committed to increasing the rate with which we return excess capital opportunistically to shareholders, and we'll see how that develops out over the year. I'll take the -- So, yes, I would say definitely saw improvement in enterprise customers, again, the $300,000 accounts growing sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I'll say that from a renewal rate perspective, enterprise still has room to improve. But I will say that our renewal rates improved sequentially Q3 to Q4 in the enterprise space, more than any other kind of large customer segment that we had, but still room to improve there admittedly. And so we're excited about the opportunities and mostly in R&D, right, that give us those opportunities to provide additional solutions and products to customers. Then I'll let Allan. Yes. And just a follow-up and maybe to add on to what Allan said. You heard in our prepared remarks, CLM grew faster than the total business and also accelerated from -- on a year-over-year basis from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, it's still a smaller share of our business, but still encouraged by that acceleration for that product. Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So, yes, G&A expense, non-GAAP G&A was up 14% year-on-year. There's two unique items that are kind of contributing to that. One is, we used to have an immaterial dollar amount, so when you look at a relatively small kind of SEC split out bucket, it has a bit of an effect. So a couple of million dollars, we used to allocate out in the prior year. We're not doing that now, but it's an immaterial kind of dollar amount overall. And then also a little bit higher litigation cost for us this year versus last year. If you exclude those two, what I'll call, unique items, G&A would have grown in the low single-digits year-over-year. So what I would say is from the efforts we've taken over the past few months and recently not only do I expect that sales and marketing expense declined year-on-year as a percentage of revenue, but I also expect to see some efficiencies and improvements in G&A as well. So I think we're focused across this business to drive efficiencies where needed, and I expect to see that next year. Yes. And just to add on top of that, it's -- while we're super excited about the opportunity in very specific cases to consider those, it's not a huge number for us today, it grows. It's continuing to grow. And again, I think, and to directly answer your question, no material impact on our results for Q4. But it's also one of these things, I think, in this business, we have a very, very broad and diverse customer base. And so there's -- we don't have single customers that, I would say, vastly impact us like there might be other companies, which, I think is a strength for us. And so -- but anyways, just to directly answer your question, no material impact. Sure. And so yes, we did have a very strong quarter and year as it regards to free cash flow, we had a 32% free cash flow yield for fiscal '24. And the reason why it's materially higher than our operating margin is frankly, just a working capital tailwind that we had, and it's really driven by two components. One is if you recall about a year ago, we had an ERP implementation that caused a delay in our ability to do some collections. So earlier this year, we've got a tailwind from that. But on top of that, we've also improved our collections process, I would say, extremely well, reduced agings. And so kind of, I would say, just really brought some operational efficiency to our working capital that showed that improvement. Now going forward, as you all know, like being able to repeat working capital improvements on top of each other year-over-year, while we're going to strive to be able to continue to improve and gain efficiencies, it's not something you usually can just get pretty easily. And so that's why in the prepared remarks, you'll find that I would expect longer term to assume a free cash flow yield more closer to that operating margin. Yes. Thanks for the question. Well, first off, again, really happy with how our international growth has progressed to the year, growing much faster than the overall business. All of our major regions grew to the double-digits in Q4. To the question about whether we think it accelerates more or less, I'm not going to provide any guidance out to that. But what I will say is that, just to reiterate, the international opportunity for us, I think, is quite sizable. Only 27% of our revenue in Q4 came from our international business. And if you think of GDP or something as a proxy, it should be, not higher than that. And so I think I'm really excited for that longer-term opportunity, but not any place to say, oh, I think it will accelerate faster or slower than any other market."

            "name": "Allan Thygesen",
            "content": "Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. DocuSign's fourth quarter operating results reflect strong progress across the three pillars of our strategic vision, accelerating product innovation, improving the reach and effectiveness of our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives and strengthening operating and financial efficiency. Before discussing the pillars, I'll briefly highlight Q4's strong business results. Q4 revenue was $712 million, up 8% year-over-year, while full year revenue was $2.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year, both outperformed our expectations. Our continued focus on efficiency while still investing for long-term growth, drove significantly improved profitability. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin rose to 25%, up one point versus last year, while full year non-GAAP operating margin improved by more than five points to 26% from 21% in fiscal '23. In addition, free cash flow more than doubled in fiscal '24 to nearly $900 million. Similar to Q3, we're encouraged by momentum across the business. From solid retention and improving usage with existing customers to strong new customer growth, organizations, large and small, continue to invest in DocuSign's value proposition. Let's turn to our strategic pillars, starting with continued improvement in our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives. In Q4, we were encouraged by improving performance with customers managed by the direct sales force. We substantially increased the amount of business from customers signing and renewing multiyear, multimillion dollar contracts with DocuSign, including Fortune 500 global leaders in energy, industrials, consumer goods, insurance and several federal and state government agencies. Our partner channel has been instrumental in driving large customer momentum. We continue to deepen relationships with strategic, enterprise-focused organizations, including SAP, Microsoft and Deloitte. These organizations are helping to accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. They also represent progress in building a vibrant partner ecosystem to extend DocuSign's reach into new markets and customer segments. To that end, we recently launched global participation in Microsoft Azure's marketplace. We can now co-sell our entire suite of products to Microsoft's enterprise customers who can draw on their existing Azure commitments to purchase DocuSign licenses. We're encouraged to already have our first $1 million customer from that channel. These partners and many more help us accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. We also continue to deliver more efficient customer growth even as we scale. In fiscal '24, we invested to improve our digital and self-serve motions, leading to sustained new customer acquisition growth. In Q4, we surpassed 1.5 million total customers across our digital and direct channels. Our breadth, scale and customer affinity is unique in the broader SaaS landscape and speaks to the continued large opportunity in front of DocuSign. Across our digital direct and partner channels, international continues to be a strong underlying growth driver. In Q4, international revenue grew more than twice as fast as total revenue and now represents more than 27% of the business, up from 25% last year. The international opportunity remains substantial and is one of our key long-term growth drivers. CRESOL, which is a financial cooperative in Brazil, recently adopted the new WhatsApp integration, adding WhatsApp signing to existing e-signature e-mail usage has reduced delays, increased response times and help CRESOL generate more revenue and broaden its reach. Much of CRESOL's credit business is with farmers and the agricultural industry with limited rule connectivity. The DocuSign WhatsApp integration allows CRESOL to bridge that connectivity gap and accelerate its credit process from days to hours. Let's turn to product innovation. Across all aspects of go-to-market, product investment is driving customer adoption. The WhatsApp integration I just mentioned led to significant envelope usage in recent customer wins in Latin America. Over 1,000 customers in UK and Europe have used and now benefit from stronger identity verification products like AI-enabled IDV Premier and our recently launched QES-compliant Identity Wallet. The recent free launch of our premium DocuSign monitor created 1,500 new accounts just this quarter. First Financial Bank, a financial services company headquartered in Indiana is using ID verification, increase the speed of consumer lending and home equity line of credit offerings. This improved security for bank staff removes manual workflows for underwriters and creates a stronger customer experience. First Financial is expanding ID verification to other use cases like credit cards and online account openings. Looking ahead, as we exited Q4, we have several hundred customers in beta in new platform services that will transform DocuSign into a more powerful solution. We'll have much more to share, and we're excited to have you join us virtually to hear about our evolving platform at this year's Momentum Customer Conference in New York on April 11th. Product momentum is clearly creating value for our customers. In fiscal '24, that momentum was validated by third parties like IDC, who named us the e-signature industry leader versus 17 other vendors in its annual worldwide assessment. Also, Gartner named DocuSign as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for contract life cycle management for the fourth year running. To that end, DocuSign CLM customers continue to be at the front line of embracing a broader agreement management use case. In Q4, DocuSign CLM growth once again significantly outpaced overall revenue. This is a positive sign as we see CLM product demand as a precursor to the value we can create across all 1.5 million DocuSign customers. Today, DocuSign CLM helps users automate and manage complex workflows, and we see the future is taking those capabilities to a broader set of users than CLM reaches today. We're seeing strong adoption of our CLM product among enterprise customers. Just this quarter, a luxury automaker used our CLM to create an elegant sales experience to match its brand value proposition. A multibillion dollar global manufacturers sped up its legal and supply chain operations with a company-wide implementation of DocuSign CLM. And a global energy company accelerated its sales processes and streamlined procurement with CLM. Our third strategic pillar is strengthening DocuSign's operating and financial efficiency. In February, we announced further cost management initiatives, including a reduction in force. This decision streamlined our business and focused investments on initiatives that provide the strongest foundation for long-term growth. Blake will share more details on the financial impact and its impact on improving profitability. In fiscal 2025, we will continue focusing on efficiency while investing to reinvigorate long-term growth. In conclusion, fiscal '24 was critical to strengthening DocuSign's foundation. We've reaccelerated product innovation, invested in our leadership talent and rightsized our organization. These are all critical steps to realize the multiyear journey to transform agreement management. And we're just getting started. The opportunity in front of DocuSign remains massive. Today's world runs on agreements, but agreement processes haven't changed in the last 100 years. Even with the evolution to digital documents, agreements and how we use their insights remain relics of antiquated paper-based systems. Sign a document stored as a flat file preserved, but disconnected from the systems that run your operations. Our sole focus is transforming those systems for our 1.5 million existing customers to make agreements more valuable for enterprises and SMBs alike. As organizations transition to a digital world, customers turn to DocuSign as the world's most trusted agreement company. We are excited for fiscal '25 and the continued impact we will have on our customers. Thank you to our incredible team for your passion and dedication to our vision and culture. With that, let me turn it over to Blake. On the second question related to customer acquisition. Yes, I don't know that we track and measure ourselves that directly on that. But I would just say we have a healthy customer acquisition funnel. It is -- there is still white space, particularly internationally and acquiring new customers and we're benefiting from that and I think getting our fair share, although, of course, I always like even more. But I'm not prepared to make any forward-looking statements about the exact number of acquisitions we'll have on a quarterly basis. Yes. So first on our overall investment and expense philosophy. Look, we want to balance solid operational execution and efficiency today with being able to invest for the medium to long-term growth that we think we have in front of us. And so we're balancing that all the time, as we looked at taking the action that Blake referred to at the beginning of February, we felt we had a little more room to get just a little leaner and be ready and still not impair our ability to grow as we launch new products and so on. So that's the balance that we're taking. We will keep looking for opportunities, and it's obviously not all about headcount. We have gotten tremendous efficiency out of the organization on many fronts, that's what produced the strong results that you saw in Q4, really, throughout the year, and the operating cash flow improvements. So we'll keep looking for those opportunities. But we feel we're rightsized for our plan right now. And if we start seeing further investment opportunities, then we will invest, but we do that on a cautious and informed basis. Yes, that's great. And maybe just as a reminder to the point that they just made about our sales marketing efficiency. The reduction force that we had last February was 95% focused in the sales marketing area. This time around, it was a little bit more balanced, but still were weighted in sales and marketing, reflecting that we felt we had efficiency opportunities throughout the company, and we wanted to make sure we capture those. I think at this point, to the extent we make incremental investments, it will probably be in R&D first. But obviously, as we launch new products, and if -- that we start seeing some leverage there, then we'll not hesitate to invest there as well. Just want to see that first. Yes. So I'll go first. We really did see strength across the board. So our cost segments, Blake highlighted that we had progress both on the enterprise side and the SMB side. From a geography perspective, yes, we grew faster internationally, but we did grow everywhere. And on the industry side, we did see a broad-based strength there as well some recovery effects, those mortgages, but we sell to customers in all industries. I highlighted during the full, new significant deals with in manufacturing, in energy and health and so on. There's hardly an industry that doesn't rely on agreements and that therefore, it doesn't represent an opportunity for us. So there really isn't much there. At an overall macro sentiment, I would say, marginally improved from my standpoint. We're not projecting anything more than that looking ahead. As always, we base our plan on current macro conditions. But I think there was a little bit of help across the breadth of our business, but we're almost an index just given the breadth of verticals, segments and countries that we have. You take the first one and I'll take the other one. Yes. On the R&D investment front, I'd say we've long felt there was an opportunity to reimagine the agreement journey for companies large and small. And we've add solutions for -- at various stages of that journey in the past, obviously, most exemplified by our signature products. In about a month, we will release a broader suite of solutions there, and that there's been a significant investment in that effort during the course of the last fiscal year. And that will continue because we feel we have a multiyear road map of value creation ahead of us there. So that is the biggest investment area. In addition to that, one other area that's getting a meaningful amount of investment is we are moving our platforms to the public cloud, Microsoft Azure, it's underway, and that's a significant effort as well from an infrastructure perspective. Those are the two things I'd highlight. Yes. Let me take that one. So I think during the course of the fiscal year that we just finished here, a lot of our effort was on making the process of buying DocuSign directly from DocuSign, and on our website and in our products much more seamless. And we made substantial improvements there. So much better flows to allow you to easily upgrade solutions to focus on -- put better use of a variety of payment solutions, et cetera. I'd say this year, that will expand beyond the core e-signature products to some of the newer products that we'll be launching and to supporting other channels. Those notably our direct sales channel, we want to offer those customers the ability to self-serve to the greatest extent possible and there will be significant capabilities added there throughout the year. And also for our partners where we have I think, opportunities for meaningful improvement and how easy it is to do business with us. And that's another area we're investing in. So this is across every pillar of our go-to-market effort that has already borne fruit, as you've seen in our digital sales growth, and it will really impact across the business, I think, this year. So very excited about that. Yes. So I do think the CLM market overall is improving. And I do think we're executing better in the CLM market. So I think CLM overall, I think more and more companies are realizing that managing your agreements better and getting more value out of them is a very strategic opportunity. It's definitely rising in the priority list. And so CLM, ours and others, is an increasingly strategic and interesting solution. So we're seeing more RFPs and so on. In terms of our competitive position, I think we're in a very strong position as illustrated in the Gartner survey and other measures of our position in the market. I think we are -- we have the largest number of accounts and are very well rated by customers for our experience. And we think there's more opportunity there to, should we say, popularize CLM to a broader audience, both within companies that are -- who are going to adopt it, as well as to smaller companies where the weight of the current solutions might not be appropriate. So it's a very positive and strategic opportunity for us. And yes, I do would summarize that to say on both fronts, some improvement. Yes. Our international growth is led more by our direct channel today. I think we have very substantial opportunity on the digital front and on the partner side, which is relatively mature right now. I think there's a lot of headroom. So lots of growth opportunity there, but most of the growth today is coming from our direct sales efforts, principally in the larger focused countries. So the top 10 markets outside the US that you would expect. As you know, we've been investing in Japan and Germany. But today, UK, Australia, Canada, France are a little larger than both of those. So all of those markets are priorities. Yes, I'll take that one. Yes, I want to be very clear. We do not use any customer data for training any of our AI models without specific contractual consent from customers. End of story. So we have a high trust position with customers. They trust us with their most sensitive documents. And we don't want to do anything to violate that trust. There are probably some companies who -- people are willing to move aggressively here, but I think we're moving responsibly and cautiously on that. We are, with all that said, we are very excited about what AI can bring, and our customers are asking us for how can we extract more value from our [indiscernible] using more modern AI technology. And so you'll hear a lot more about that in a month at momentum. But to the point about -- the trust is the starting position. Maybe one other point I'd make is, assuming you give us consent, we then anonymize and aggregate that data so that there is no opportunity for anyone to extract any confidential issues or data out of the agreements. Yes, we have done a few deals like that, and I think it will continue to grow with some of our very largest clients. And as we offer a broader set of products, obviously, an enterprise license also becomes more interesting as you can mix and match across products. But it still remains a very small part of the business. We even some of our very largest customers, some of the contract renewals remain on an envelope basis. Yes. I would make one other point. ELA has a very specific connotation of sort of unlimited consumption and being able to combine products across. We have leaned in significantly harder to make sure that we are competitive in large enterprise deals. And we did some very large and very nice renewals with some large customers. I think in part as a result of that improved motion. So we have senior people on it. We have our large deal desk. We have all the things that you would expect to make sure that we are as competitive as possible. Okay. With that, thank you all for joining and for your support as we continue to build a solid foundation for DocuSign. We are proud of the strong results in Q4 and of the progress that we're making to reinvigorate innovation and add value for our customers, our employees and shareholders. We look forward to what will be a very exciting fiscal 2025. Thank you. We'll see you next quarter."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. DocuSign's third quarter operating results reflect progress on our initiatives to expand beyond e-signature into agreement management. And our financial performance underscores our ongoing focus on driving profitability and sustaining healthy free cash flow. As I reflect on our journey over the last 12 months, the three key pillars of our strategic vision remain the same. First, to accelerate innovation towards agreement management, which we believe will further expand market opportunity; second, improving the reach and efficiency of our omnichannel go-to-market efforts; and third, strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. Now before we discuss each pillar in detail, let me first highlight this quarter's financial results. Total Q3 revenue came in at $700 million, up 9% versus prior year. We're particularly pleased with the improvement in our overall profitability this quarter against persistent macro headwinds and delayed at customer caution. Specifically, our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, a 400 basis point increase versus prior year and non-GAAP operating income grew 27% year-over-year to $187 million. We also generated record free cash flow in Q3 coming in at $240 million, up significantly versus the prior year. We're focused on strengthening our profitability while making balanced investments in areas with strong long-term growth opportunities. We're also seeing encouraging signs of business stabilization. With improvement in some metrics, notably customers with annualized contract value greater than $300,000. Blake will expand on the metrics further in his remarks. With respect to our first pillar, accelerating product innovation. Our focus is twofold. First, we continue to improve our core e-signature product capability. In Q3, DocuSign became the exclusive e-signature provider for Microsoft's Power Page Integration, making it easy for website makers to incorporate signatures and forms without code, improving the client signing experience and opening the door to building pre and post signature workflows. In November, we also launched a WhatsApp integration for e-signature. In an internal comparative study, we found that agreements delivered via WhatsApp are signed nearly seven times faster than those sent via e-mail. Given the ubiquity of WhatsApp globally, it's an important update to bring e-signature to markets outside the US. In addition, IDC recognized DocuSign as a leader in its 2023 e-signature assessment. DocuSign continues to hold the leadership position of IDC for e-signature based on having a complete portfolio of solutions for customers. And we're seeing existing customers grow and expand their use cases. Hantz Group, which is a Michigan-based wealth management firm is using e-signature to deliver a fully digital experience for its clients through a proprietary mobile app and is expanding their use of DocuSign products with notary, SMS, identity verification and monitoring. Our APIs and strength and compliance made DocuSign the best choice for Hantz and they've made DocuSign the standard across their entire organization, which will approximately double their use of our products. Second, we're also investing towards broadening our value proposition beyond e-signature and into agreement management. In Q3, we shipped embedded agreements that deliver a seamless signing experience directly on our customers' websites and applications. In addition, we launched Microsoft Power Automate for the generation of personalized professional-looking documents for signing directly from Microsoft Power Automate flows. We also launched foundational features and functionality that help us expand beyond e-signature into wide-scale agreement management. These features deliver customer delight and remove friction from all aspects of the agreement process. We see the success of CLM as a proof point that there are broader agreement management use cases to address the customers of all sizes. CLM continues to grow well, particularly with North American enterprise customers. And for the fourth year in a row, our CLM solution was recognized as a leader by Gartner in contract life cycle management. Noting our strong market understanding, product strategy and road map vision, including upcoming Generative AI enhancements. This quarter, we expanded a relationship that began more than five years ago with Veeco USA, who's the leader in workplace innovation. Veeco began using DocuSign e-signature and has added CLM as part of this transformation into a digital services company. Our AI solution will help Veeco streamline and enhance search and review of executed customer contracts with actionable insights to better serve its customers. Thank you to our partners at Spaulding Ridge, who are helping to strengthen our commitment and partnership with Veeco. As we look ahead, we envision serving similar customer needs not addressed by CLM via a broader agreement management platform designed for all of our customers in all segments. We are previewing with slide customer now and will have much more to share on our product road map and strategic vision at our Momentum User Conference in April 2024. Across both our e-signature core and future agreement management products, we believe our investment will lead to even further differentiation in a competitive market. We're encouraged by steady win rates and excited for the impact we can create for customers. This past quarter also demonstrated execution against our second pillar, improved omnichannel go-to-market where we gained traction across our direct sales, digital and partner engagement. Our international business spans all channels as an important part of our addressable market. It's really an untapped opportunity for DocuSign expansion. In Q3, our international revenue grew approximately three times faster than our North American business. We also saw traction in the adoption of our Identity education solutions, which meet stringent regulatory standards in the EU and elsewhere. And in Q3, we launched a Japanese localized version of our CLM product. The recently launched WhatsApp integration also highlights our international ambitions. Our digital channel once again grew at a faster rate than our direct business during the quarter, a strong sign that our product-led growth initiative continues to drive new customer acquisition and top of funnel activity. We continue to optimize our site and remove friction from the try-and-buy journey while creating a more personalized experience with improved localization. We're seeing particular strength in new customer acquisition in our international markets as well as improved conversion rates in the trial to pay license purchase conversion rates. Our trusted brand and product strength continue to be assets for our direct sales team. Mountain America Credit Union, one of the biggest credit unions in the US has reduced the time it takes to close a credit card application by 30% by integrating DocuSign with its proprietary loan origination system. Mountain America switched to DocuSign from a different electronic signature provider in part because our strong brand reputation inspires confidence from its members, but also because our rich catalog of best-in-class APIs give its developers the flexibility to create solutions that are customized to its exact needs. That is enabling Mountain America to deliver a seamless, minimal click experience that aligns with the standards as members expect in their financial institutions. An important pillar of our go-to-market plan is strengthening our partner ecosystem. In October, we hosted our first ever partner day. It was fantastic to meet with our system integrators, resellers and software vendors from around the world, sharing our commitment to growing our business together. As an example, the ISV Embed pay-as-you-go initiative we announced in Q2 is accelerating and driving new customer wins. Before I pass it to Blake, I want to address some progress on our third strategic pillar. Our company's focus on financial and operational efficiency. In the quarter, we delivered record operating margin and free cash flow. While we continue to invest for long-term growth, we will also continue to be strong financial stewards of the business. We still have a lot of work to do, but I am pleased with our progress over the past 12 months. I am more confident than ever in the value we can create for our customers in our business and the scale and strength of our customer base. We're in the early stages of our journey to expand beyond e-signature into agreement management. But there is very concrete customer validation of the market opportunity and meaningful progress towards our goals. Thank you to the DocuSign team who's inspired me with their commitment to this transformation. With that, let me turn it over to Blake.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. As I approach my six-month anniversary at DocuSign, I remain excited about the long-term opportunity and our team's execution against the three key pillars we've outlined previously. Accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market strategy and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. We delivered solid results in Q3, demonstrating the stability of our business model. In the third quarter, total revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $700 million, and subscription revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $682 million. We continue to drive solid new customer growth during the quarter, despite the challenging macro and software buying environment, which is evidence of DocuSign's durable value proposition. In addition, I'm proud of our operational execution highlighted by strong profitability and free cash flow generation. While we have much work still to do, we are making progress. Third quarter billings rose 5% year-over-year to $692 million. As expected, expansion headwinds continued to impact year-over-year billings growth. These dynamics are also visible in our dollar net retention, which was 100% in Q3. Expansion rates continue to be tempered by spending optimization and IT budget scrutiny. We expect dollar net retention to trend downward in Q4. That said, we are encouraged by a few early data points evident in our results this quarter. First, we saw year-over-year consumption stabilization or improvement in a number of verticals, including business services, technology and insurance. Financial services by contrast, continue to be more impacted. Although real estate also continued to be pressured by the interest rate environment, it improved on a year-over-year basis for the third quarter in a row with significant opportunity for further improvement. We're increasingly operating in a post-COVID environment and I'm pleased that our weighted average contract duration continues to remain consistent at 18 months. Also, by the end of this fiscal year, we expect only around 10% of our book of business to be from contracts signed during calendar years 2020 and 2021. DocuSign's value proposition is broad-based, and we benefit long-term by doing business with customers across a diverse set of sectors and segments. Second, we are pleased with the early progress we are seeing from our investments in the omnichannel go-to-market efforts. Driven by our direct sales efforts, the enterprise segment showed some early potential relative to performance in previous quarters. The number of customers with annualized contract values greater than $300,000 rose slightly to 1,051 from 1,047 in the prior quarter and was approximately flat year-over-year. This increase is an improvement after two quarters of sequential declines. Also, our CLM business grew double digits year-over-year. As enterprise customers continue to optimize their e-signature spend, we are seeing some customers taking advantage of our CLM product. Enterprise customer adoption is encouraging because CLM is the early proving ground for investment in a broader agreement management use case for our entire customer base. In addition, within our omnichannel pillar, international revenue grew 18% year-over-year, reaching 185 million in the third quarter, representing 26% of our total revenue. This was a slight acceleration in year-over-year growth from the previous quarter. Most international markets remain at an early adoption stage due to regulatory history and cultural habits. At the same time, however, international represents the largest portion of our TAM, and I'm pleased to see continued success of our hybrid go-to-market strategy. Related to the investments we're making in our PLG and self-serve motions, digital revenue growth outperformed direct. Digital remains the primary source for new customer acquisition, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers in Q3 and bringing the total customer base to 1.47 million, up 11% year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 7,000 direct customers bringing the total number of direct customers to 233,000, a 15% year-over-year increase. Turning to our third strategic pillar. We delivered strong margin expansion and healthy cash flow during Q3, highlighting our focus on operating and financial efficiency. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 83% in line with the prior year. Third quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 86% also in line with the prior year. Q3 non-GAAP operating income reached a record $187 million, representing a 27% margin, up nearly 400 basis points from 23% and $147 million in the prior year. During the quarter, we increased focus on investment prioritization, hiring plans and operating expenses. There will be continuing opportunities for greater efficiency even as we invest to drive long-term growth. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, a $0.22 per share improvement from $0.57 last year. We ended Q3 with 6,945 employees compared to 7,522 the year prior and up from 6,748 in Q2. We will remain disciplined with our head count investment. Hiring will continue to focus on opportunities to drive sustainable long-term growth like those in R&D. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $264 million compared with $53 million in the same quarter last year. While an ERP transition impacted last year's cash flow results, I'm proud of the significant free cash flow we generated this quarter. Third quarter free cash flow was a record $240 million representing a 34% margin compared with $36 million or 6% a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $750 million in free cash flow, underscoring the strong fundamentals of this business. With regards to the balance sheet, we exited Q3 with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This includes the repayment of $37 million of convertible debt that matured during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to address the remaining convertible debt of $690 million that matures next month. Turning to our share repurchase program. We redeployed excess capital during the quarter and repurchased 1.8 million shares for approximately $75 million. In addition to our share repurchase program, during the quarter, we used $36 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the diluted impact of our equity programs. We remain committed to opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $696 million to $700 million in Q4 or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and $2.746 billion to $2.750 billion for fiscal '24 or a 9% year-over-year increase. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $679 million to $683 million in Q4 or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and $2.670 billion to $2.674 billion for fiscal '24 or a 9% year-over-year increase. For billings, we expect $758 million to $768 million in Q4 or a 3% growth rate year-over-year at the midpoint and $2.835 billion to $2.845 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for Q4 and 81.5% to 82.5% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 22.5% to 23.5% for Q4 and 24% to 25% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $207 million to $212 million for both Q4 and fiscal '24. In closing, we're pleased to report a quarter of consistent execution against our three strategic pillars accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market strategy and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. We have a strong foundation with well over 1 million customer relationships and improving product momentum. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by investing in durable long-term growth, delivering on our profitability goals and generating sustainable free cash flow. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we focus on helping our customers accelerate their business growth, mitigate risk and enable customer experiences that are easier and more delightful. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I understand NRR is a trailing metric and I appreciate the color that Q4 will see another decline. But are we starting to get visibility in the trough for that metric now that you're putting those headwinds from the multiyear COVID contract behind you and maybe the new product investments start layering in more meaningfully next year?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. I'll take a stab at this and Allan, if you want to jump in, feel free. So just a quick reminder, dollar net retention or DNR is our direct business only in greater than one year. Like you said, the trend downwards in line with our previous communications. And as covered in our prepared remarks, for me, we have -- we expect to see continued pressure in Q4. It's a tough macro environment still where companies continue to scrutinize investments and leading to smaller expansion opportunities for us. It's a bit of a lagging indicator. So the thing that I'm focused on mostly and the company is focused on is what are the efforts we're making to stabilize and improve it over the longer term. And so -- like you said, things like the intelligent agreement management and the new product innovation, including CLM and pricing and packaging enhancements and stronger PLG motions that we're working on in self-serve, which can help us improve those win or renewal weights, if you will, over time is what we're focused on. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, we are seeing some very early signs of potential, I would call it, cost of optimism, right? Like consumption up across a number of verticals. We saw sticky future adoption improve from last quarter on a year-over-year basis. And that's the percentage of our direct customers using five or more kind of incremental features that was at 58% in Q3, up from Q2, and it was up about 12 points year-over-year. So they're just -- the early signs of potential optimism, but I think it's too early for us to put any type of a target or a specific time line out there. But focusing on those product management efforts and those go-to-market efforts, I think, is how we get excited about the future.\nJake Roberge: Okay. Helpful. And then just a follow-up on those products you were talking about. When do you think CLM becomes a more meaningful part of the business where it actually starts impacting expansion rates instead of NRR just being really driven by e-signature consumption. It seems like you've been talking about the potential for that product suite for a few years. But what do you need to do to get that product the more main stage with customers?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I'll take a crack at that. So first, I'd say that if you look -- if you think about our broader vision, CLM is really a leading indicator or early instantiation of our broader vision for intelligent agreement management. It is very heavily focused on the enterprise. And I think we and everyone else providing CLM solutions have been held back by the required significant services and customization investment that the current generation of CLM products mandate. And so our opportunity is to make that significantly more lightweight and delightful, lowering the bar for companies of all sizes really to take advantage of that platform. That is a huge part of our focus right now. We're in early access on some important pieces of that. And so over the next few quarters, you will see that going to roll out to a much broader set of customers than CLM and DocuSign or any other vendor can address today. And we think that unlocks opportunity, as I said, everywhere.\nJake Roberge: Helpful. Thanks for taking the questions and well done on the nice execution.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. Wanted to dig in on margins and the margin outperformance. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more context on the source of upside in the quarter? And then how to think about the trajectory of investments going forward? Like the full year guide was raised. Just wondering if there's been sort of any changes in the investment philosophy pulling back in any areas or just letting more of the upside flow through to the bottom line? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. I appreciate the question. So with regards to the outperformance on the operating margin, we made a concerted effort, I would say, starting kind of like late September to inspect and rationalize investments across the business. It's really just about increasing focus on, what I would call, disciplined spending while we continue to invest in the areas that where we have longer-term growth aspirations. During Q3, we prioritize investments. And so that includes the rate of hiring, the value opportunities for organizational efficiency, but then also overall operating expenses with focus on leveraging existing resources where possible, but still being able to invest for longer-term growth. With regard to your question on the trajectory and the investment philosophy, we're all big believers here in a balanced outlook, which is we need to be able to invest to get the long-term growth and achieve those aspirations that we have. But at the same point in time, we need to be efficient and productive with the assets that we have. And so I really am proud of the team for embracing that. And so I don't think no investment, I would say, philosophy changes from our part. But I would just say a little bit maybe kind of more executed focus on that for us and we were able to show some pretty good performance, I think, this quarter and I'm really proud of the team for that level of execution.\nJosh Baer: Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I would just echo, if I can just echo Blake's point that the entire management team, not just like is very focused on this balance that he referenced. We absolutely want to free up capital and that is a team effort to look everywhere in the company to free up resources where we can then invest more particularly on the product side. We did some of that earlier this year, as you know, but it's an ongoing continuous effort, not just a onetime thing, and I think that's reflected in the results.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you, Allan and Blake for taking my questions. Maybe first, just wanted to ask, obviously, you're guiding to 7% year-over-year billings growth for fiscal '24. I guess I know you're not guiding to fiscal '25 just yet, but how should we think of the growth trajectory for next year, especially as you come through some kind of trough on the NRR side?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So I'll take a stab at that. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in a short period of time. When I say that, I mean across our business, both in just operational efficiency but also accelerating product evolution and innovation. In Q3, particularly, we improved operating margins, we generated significant free cash flow. And I think we're evolving our mind-set across the company. As I mentioned earlier on the question that was just asked before this, in terms of our long-term approach, we're going to balance driving durable long-term growth with operating efficiency. Top of our priority is to make the right strategic investments to drive business momentum and, frankly, to billings, which is, I think, what you're referring to in the coming years. And it doesn't happen overnight, especially at the business of the scale. But we believe we have the right product and go-to-market focus and we've got a good leadership team in place to make that happen. And you alluded to this, but given that we're still working through our planning and forecasting process for next year. We'll provide our standard formal fiscal year '25 outlook in our Q4 earnings call three months from now. But as you think about next year, I imagine you want to consider the Q4 exit rate trends as you think about next year and at the same time, we believe there's further opportunity to drive improved efficiency. In our existing business and our operating expenses and then also taking into account historical seasonality changes as we go from Q4 to Q1 with fewer days in the quarter and things like that, just all kind of the basics that you would want to pay attention to. But other than that, we'll provide our full year -- our fiscal '25 formal guidance in our next quarter's call.\nLuv Sodha: Got it. And one quick follow-up, if I may. Just wanted to ask about your philosophy around stock-based compensation? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So I mean I think the philosophy on stock-based comp is generally you want to be able to provide the incentive and the ability to attract and retain the best talent possible to allow us to reach the aspirations for growth that we want to get to. I know that I think our stock-based comp as a percentage of revenue in the current quarter I think was 23%. I think that was up slightly year-over-year from '22. I would say that the driver of the increase is really most about the new management team. So it's driven by the executive comp that drove that year-over-year increase, not necessarily the other part of the company. I think that, for us, it's something we're slightly above our peer average, and so it's something that we are paying attention to. But it's a balanced approach, again, right? We want to be able to attract and retain the right people for the job that -- so we can get into this next chapter of growth for DocuSign. But it is something we pay attention to and are looking at.\nLuv Sodha: Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I would just add, we have that. We discussed that topic with the Board and the Compensation Committee and we will share our longer-term plans, but our goal, as Blake said is to manage it down over time without fundamentally disrupting our ability to execute. It was necessary to attract a new management team and to rebalance our employees following the stock decline, but I think we think we're in a more normalized set now, and we should be able to manage to something more towards the benchmarks.\nLuv Sodha: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBradley Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about a comment Allan you made earlier in the call that I think you're seeing increased conversion in the top of funnel business. Would love to get some more color on there. Do you feel like there's some learning there? I know this has been a priority for you since joining the company and building that top of funnel. So any color on that end of the business and the conversion uptick that you mentioned?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Well, so I think you all know, we acquire a tremendous number of new customers every quarter. And most of those, vast majority of those come in via our website and onboard themselves. And then over time, we grow them. And as they show potential and opportunity, then we engage them with our sales teams and our support to customer success teams. I would say that our digital motion has made significant improvements during the course of this year. So for customers that are in essence natively digital, we have improved that part of the funnel, not only you can buy more things, you can upgrade your existing plans. All of that stuff is working much better now. We're adding more international currencies every quarter. So all of those things are helping improve the performance of our digital business. In addition to that, we are in the process of building out ability for customers who are currently serviced through our sales teams to handle a number of activities themselves without human assistance. And that is very -- has very high leverage both in terms of providing a better offering to our customers and in terms of freeing up our sales teams to work on higher-value work. But I think we still have some quarters to go on implementing that and seeing the full benefit of that. So the benefits of this self-serve PLG project continue to accrue and will accrue into next year. But we're seeing really good progress in that business is growing faster than our direct business. And it's improving on most performance metrics. So that's, yes, very happy with the progress there.\nBradley Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Allan. And then one, if I may, the net revenue retention, dollar-based net revenue retention coming down next quarter, could you just help unpack that for us a little bit on gross versus expansion? Is gross kind of holding and this is mostly expansion related? I know it's a backward-looking metric. But if you could just help us unpack that a little bit on the growth side? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, there's not much more, I would say, a level of detail that we're going to disclose publicly about it. I think it's just for us that it's a metric that we know if we can deliver on the product innovation and the road map and the self-service and the PLG motions that we have in front of us, we really believe we've got a chance to stabilize that metric and then reverse that trend. Now for us, that's top of mind. Obviously, it is a lagging metric, so there's time that you're going to -- it's going to take to see that occur. But I would say there was nothing that spoke out about Q3 that stood out that I would call it different than the prior quarter or two.\nBradley Sills: All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the questions. Blake, I wanted to spend some more time on the consumption commentary that you provided. Certainly helpful. I'm just wondering if there's anything else you can tell us in terms of the shape of those improvements. How that compares to prior periods? And when you're talking about consumption for DocuSign, is that mainly signature volumes or Are there other attributes of customer profiles we should be considering as part of that commentary?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And it's a good question. Thanks for asking. So when we talk about consumption today, it's primarily around the e-signature space, primarily around, if you will, the envelopes that are used. So what is the usage by our customers on a year-over-year basis. So those verticals that I highlighted at some of the stronger year-over-year growth in consumption that we've seen over the past quarter or two. So I think we're, again, cautiously optimistic about it. And just to be clear, too, there's still verticals that are more challenged, right? I highlighted financial services is one, and I also highlight real estate as the other one, which probably comes as no surprise to folks who are living in this interest rate environment. I think the thing that makes me -- I don't want to say happier, but you can see a little bit of light there is that real estate has improved on a year-over-year basis over the past three quarters. So that's good, but it's not anywhere back to near where it was I would say prior to the whole interest rate challenges that we've kind of entered into the past year or so. But so excited about that, but again, that's also, I think, in the prepared remarks, I made a comment about the significant remaining opportunity. And so a lot of it, I think, you're probably seeing is that as the macro environment returns to more normalcy in certain verticals, then we believe we're a beneficiary of that. And I think that's relevant because we have such a broad-based set of verticals in such a diverse customer base as well. So it's something that when things improve, we think we're a beneficiary of that. And your guess is probably as good or better than mine on when that happens.\nAllan Thygesen: I don't know if any of us --\nBlake Grayson: Go ahead.\nAllan Thygesen: No, that one maybe not. And I'll just add to what Blake said, I think consumption -- we think of consumption as an imperfect but important leading and predictive indicator of renewal. And so that's why we track it closely and we're talking about it. And we're seeing modestly encouraging signs there in consumption trends relative to the commitments customers have made. Maybe one other comment on that is we are also coming to the end of the COVID. We have a few quarters left of COVID renewals, but it is already significantly down and weight in our business and so that's coming to an end, which is positive.\nMichael Turrin: That's all super helpful. And then maybe one more on just the leading indicator side. Appreciating it's noisy, but if we look at billings this quarter, it's down sequentially. Last quarter you talked about -- it wasn't early renewals. It was just kind of the timing of renewals, having some improvements. So did that maybe help Q2 relative to Q3 or just help us kind of square the seasonal trends and what can drive the volatility from quarter-to-quarter on that metric? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Yes, you bet. So, right, Q3 billings growth of 5% relative to Q2 of 10% year-over-year. Still really pleased with the Q3. We came in above our expectations on that. But the detail like you're asking about from Q2 to Q3, it's really driven, I would say, by three primary areas. The first is we have a hard comp in Q3. If you look back at our historical results, I think our Q3 billings growth in fiscal '23 was up 17% -- around 17% year-over-year. And that was the highest in fiscal '23. And that was driven by a year ago, we had a pretty strong early renewals kind of momentum that grew that billings number in Q2 the prior year. Now we're still doing well this year with regard to our renewals, it's just a hard comp that we're having to deal with. The second thing item is what you talked about, which is that on-time renewal impact. And as I discussed in the last call and my predecessor discussed on the call before that, the benefit that we've had in the higher on-time renewals in the first half of '24. It just -- you have a smaller impact as you go through the year in the second half. And so it's really primarily a timing issue. And so we're still doing actually really quite well on on-time renewal execution. The team is doing a great job with it. It's just a smaller impact on year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. And then the final -- the third thing that impacts that billings number, frankly, is just lower expansion rates, right? I mean IT budget scrutiny and people that are sitting in my seat are asking the right questions, which is how do I do more with less, where are the places that I can manage costs well, it's -- I mean, I'm doing it here, frankly, in my role as an operational CFO. And that, along with macro impacts overall billings growth, and it's evident in those DNR rates. But as Allan mentioned and I have mentioned already, like we are seeing those consumption trends that we saw some marginal improvement quarter-over-quarter. And it's still early for us. We got to see that hopefully hold here for the next few quarters. But things are also improving, but that's just really the dynamics of the decel and year-over-year growth between Q2 and Q3.\nMichael Turrin: Appreciate the details. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not sure if this is who this is for, but I guess as we think about the product set for next year, Obviously, there's a lot of organic investments you're making on the Gen AI side. Can you just talk about how you expect that the product set available products and upsells to evolve next year? And with the launch of some of these generative AI services, how does that kind of change the philosophy around still kind of offering an envelope base signature product rather than something more subscription base that's not tight to envelope? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, there's several points in there. First, I'd just say, look, our CLM business is growing faster than our signature business, and I expect as we launch this broader intelligent agreement management platform to a broader set of customers that pattern of that broader category growing faster will continue. The second point you made about the envelope versus subscription basis. We are, in fact, already experimenting with should we say, unlimited envelope billing models for a variety of customers. So for very large customers, we have entered into some enterprise license agreements. And those have been, I think, quite helpful at one very large bank that we did one with as they, after they signed that agreement, they proceeded to remove a competing solution from some of their workflows. And I think we have that opportunity across some of our very large customers. And then in the Commercial segment, the mid-market and SMB segment, we're now competing more directly with some of our lower-priced competitors who have offered unlimited envelope packages. And not surprisingly, if you give people a competitive unlimited envelope from DocuSign versus a lesser branded, less well featured product then they choose DocuSign. And so we're seeing really, really positive results and to the point where I expect that we will continue to broaden that rollout. So overall, I'm feeling quite good about our evolution and our response to competition on multiple fronts as well as the broadening of our product road map that you alluded to in the first part of your question.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Great. And Blake maybe a question for you on free cash flow. So very, very strong here in the quarter relative to consensus expectations. How should we be thinking about just free cash flow for the full year, was there any onetime items in that number? And as you think about next year, what seems to be kind of an increased operational discipline, should we be thinking about free cash flow margins expanding kind of consistently with operating margin expansion. Just anyway to think about that medium-term framework. Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So, yes, really happy with the $240 million cash flow that was generated this quarter. It's a combination of just ongoing strong operating results. But we also did have some working capital improvements that impacted that number. When you look at the cash flow statement, you're going to see there the changes in operating assets and liabilities, and we've really had a strong improvement on the collection side on an AR. And so that's great. And so that it drives it. And then I said this in the prepared remarks, comparing to prior year can be a little tricky because of the ERP transition that happened prior year. So we had a more muted free cash flow generation number. But regardless of that, really excited about the free cash flow we got. Now to your question on the yield, it was really strong. It was 34%. And while I'm a big fan of the working capital tailwind and I'm really proud of the team for the discipline and the improvements there, that can be something that's challenging, right, to pile onto every year going forward. There's always some good working capital improvements you can make. But I think that if you think about this business in the long-term, it's probably fair to assume that your free cash flow yield trends a lot closer to your operating margin yield. So as long as you make operating margin improvements, you should be able to capture most of that right down to the free cash flow line. But then also in this business, the beauty of this business from a free cash flow perspective is that if you can drive operating margin improvement and you can drive reaccelerated billings growth because of the way our working capital works, your free cash flow generation can really accelerate. And so like this is a much longer-term period that I'm talking about, but it is the power of this model, which is super exciting. And so I do think, though, like, I mean I think in the span of time, you would think free cash flow yield should trend closer to your operating margin deal that we've been. We've done better than that and free cash flow pretty significantly better than that in free cash flow this quarter, but it's mostly on the back of those working capital improvements or not mostly, but a large chunk of it. And so you have to be cautious about assuming that you're going to expand on those every quarter.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. I'd love to go back to the comment when you were describing the puts and takes on the vertical side when you mentioned that FINS felt a little bit more pressured or impacted. Just curious, was that a comment about the more rate sensitive mortgage-related transactions or was that a broader comment on FINS. And I'm wondering if your fourth quarter guidance reflects any anticipation of the FINS vertical stabilizing? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I'll just start, and Blake, you can add. Look, I think in terms of the mix impact of financial services, I think, that's mostly behind us, but we have experienced that over the last several years, both on the mortgage side and financial services industry. And we saw some in the smaller banks, for example, that IT spend froze with all the turmoil in the spring, some of the very largest banks have also had particularly aggressive cost management efforts. I'd say, overall, we've seen some modest recovery. It's still growing a little slower than the business overall, but trending better. And we'll see what happens with interest rates. Our current forecast assumes that macro conditions continue as they are. I recognize there's optimism they may get better. We'd love that, but we don't want to move that in our guidance.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. Just to follow up. My general philosophy is I don't make macro forecast as a team because just like I think we joked about it earlier on the call, it's a hard business to get into. And so we forecast what we see. And so if things were to change one way or the other, we would then have to -- we'd speak to that variance.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nPatrick Walravens: Great and thank you. Congratulations on the business turning here. It's great to see. So Allan how is DocuSign's relationship these days with Salesforce? Historically, I know it's been really strong. The reason I ask is during Dreamforce. This year, they had a session on Salesforce contracts, and they sort of laid out the road map for Salesforce contracts where they have AI functionality coming in the spring and then obligation management in the summer and then red lining the year after that. So I'm just wondering how are things with Salesforce?\nAllan Thygesen: I think our relationship with Salesforce is as strong as ever. We renewed our strategic partnership this summer. I was just over there meeting with one of the senior executives yesterday. It's a very healthy relationship at every level. And we have probably more -- we have certainly a more Salesforce-enabled business than with any other software partner and that includes other very large software companies. So Salesforce has been a trading partner, and they remain that. On the CLM side, yes, they certainly have a contract offering covering out. They previously offered that in their vertical products, and now they're generalizing it somewhat. I think that the challenge is that the market is moving to a horizontal model by which I mean 2/3 almost of all the CLM RFPs that we see are for cross-functional contract management. In other words, a single centralized contract management system across, let's say, procurement front of the house, HR, et cetera. And that will be hard for Salesforce or other even very large companies that are focused on one particular workflow or another. And so I expect that we will continue to collaborate very closely with Salesforce on both the signature side and the CLM side. And I'm not too worried about the sales force contracts piece, but never under estimate Salesforce. They're a fantastic company and partner.\nPatrick Walravens: That's super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Yeah, thanks very much. Allan, I was wondering, if you could just double-click a little bit on the international opportunity. You called it out in the prepared remarks. Is that largely sort of PLG-led right now or are you thinking about sort of bringing more direct sales into play over in certain geographies. Can you just give us some sense of how you view that opportunity, given you're obviously less penetrated outside the US? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. It's actually a full omnichannel thing and it's very market context specific. So first of all, we have a substantial amount of direct sales teams deployed in some of the major international markets UK, France, Germany, Australia, and we service Canada, obviously, Brazil, a meaningful size team there as well and a spattering of folks in other markets. So historically that was our principal go-to-market model. We're now really balancing that across direct investment where we can put enough wood behind the arrow and there's enough return on that investment. And then a combination of a digital motion which we can obviously serve 180 countries that way. And then a partner motion in countries where we -- where it makes sense to leave with that. So you took a smaller developing market, let's say, it wouldn't make sense for us to put a direct sales team on the ground, but we wouldn't be able to fully exploit the opportunity strictly through a digital-only motion. And so I think we have tremendous opportunity on both of those fronts. And we are seeing growth both in our digital channels, where international is growing faster than domestic and in our direct channels where it's growing faster than domestic. So we'll continue on that. Just to return to a theme from prior calls, as we looked at prioritization and where we're really going to put additional investment, both from a direct sales standpoint, but also in all the various supporting functions that are necessary to really have an effective go-to-market motion. We prioritized investing in Germany and Japan, which were markets that where we had some level of direct sales investment but we hadn't invested as aggressively in marketing and back-office functions like legal and finance or in product. And so that has been a priority since the spring. And we're making really good progress in both of those markets. I mentioned last time, we opened our office in Munich. We have an office in Tokyo. We have launched localized products for several of those markets mentioned the Japanese CLM product that we shipped here a couple of months ago, a lot of the identity verification stuff, and more stuff coming here shortly in that realm, very targeted at the EU in general, in Germany, in particular. And so we are investing aggressively I would say in a direct sales motion maybe our top 10 markets globally and then a combination of partner and digital throughout other markets where we can. There'll be some very long tail countries where we can only serve with a digital motion, but that's how we approach it.\nKirk Materne: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSonak Kolar: Great. This is Sonak Kolar on for Mark Murphy. Thank you taking the question. Allan, can you provide an update on any changes you may be seeing in the competitive dynamics for the e-signature market, particularly towards the lower end market that you called out in the past? Just curious if there's a sense that DocuSign e-signature efforts are helping with the retention and competitive wins, particularly within those users of basic e-signature use cases?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think the dynamic is as I've described in the previous quarters, I don't see a material change. So with larger clients, we may see local competitors in certain international markets, Adobe and some of them and then the smaller clients, it's just mattering of a variety of names that are maybe less familiar. And I think we are -- I'm not seeing any change in our win rates in competitive deals. And I'm cautiously optimistic with some of the initiatives I referenced earlier in terms of our new pricing and packaging that we are responding pretty effectively at both ends of the market. And then lastly, I just mentioned at the very low end, if you will, where it's really being embedded in workflows. We've dramatically upgraded our solutions for ISVs to embed DocuSign, and we've adopted a more flexible billing model that we refer to as pay-as-you-go and that saw some very nice accelerated growth here since the launch in Q2. So, on multiple fronts, I'm feeling that we're doing pretty well, and I'm not seeing a material change in the competitive dynamic.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Allan Thygesen for closing comments.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining today's call. So this quarter, DocuSign was especially effective at making progress on our product initiatives while balancing those investments with operational efficiency. So we are continuing to build on our considerable scale as we expand beyond e-signature into intelligent agreement management. Thanks for your time. Look forward to seeing all of you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. As I approach my six-month anniversary at DocuSign, I remain excited about the long-term opportunity and our team's execution against the three key pillars we've outlined previously. Accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market strategy and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. We delivered solid results in Q3, demonstrating the stability of our business model. In the third quarter, total revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $700 million, and subscription revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $682 million. We continue to drive solid new customer growth during the quarter, despite the challenging macro and software buying environment, which is evidence of DocuSign's durable value proposition. In addition, I'm proud of our operational execution highlighted by strong profitability and free cash flow generation. While we have much work still to do, we are making progress. Third quarter billings rose 5% year-over-year to $692 million. As expected, expansion headwinds continued to impact year-over-year billings growth. These dynamics are also visible in our dollar net retention, which was 100% in Q3. Expansion rates continue to be tempered by spending optimization and IT budget scrutiny. We expect dollar net retention to trend downward in Q4. That said, we are encouraged by a few early data points evident in our results this quarter. First, we saw year-over-year consumption stabilization or improvement in a number of verticals, including business services, technology and insurance. Financial services by contrast, continue to be more impacted. Although real estate also continued to be pressured by the interest rate environment, it improved on a year-over-year basis for the third quarter in a row with significant opportunity for further improvement. We're increasingly operating in a post-COVID environment and I'm pleased that our weighted average contract duration continues to remain consistent at 18 months. Also, by the end of this fiscal year, we expect only around 10% of our book of business to be from contracts signed during calendar years 2020 and 2021. DocuSign's value proposition is broad-based, and we benefit long-term by doing business with customers across a diverse set of sectors and segments. Second, we are pleased with the early progress we are seeing from our investments in the omnichannel go-to-market efforts. Driven by our direct sales efforts, the enterprise segment showed some early potential relative to performance in previous quarters. The number of customers with annualized contract values greater than $300,000 rose slightly to 1,051 from 1,047 in the prior quarter and was approximately flat year-over-year. This increase is an improvement after two quarters of sequential declines. Also, our CLM business grew double digits year-over-year. As enterprise customers continue to optimize their e-signature spend, we are seeing some customers taking advantage of our CLM product. Enterprise customer adoption is encouraging because CLM is the early proving ground for investment in a broader agreement management use case for our entire customer base. In addition, within our omnichannel pillar, international revenue grew 18% year-over-year, reaching 185 million in the third quarter, representing 26% of our total revenue. This was a slight acceleration in year-over-year growth from the previous quarter. Most international markets remain at an early adoption stage due to regulatory history and cultural habits. At the same time, however, international represents the largest portion of our TAM, and I'm pleased to see continued success of our hybrid go-to-market strategy. Related to the investments we're making in our PLG and self-serve motions, digital revenue growth outperformed direct. Digital remains the primary source for new customer acquisition, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers in Q3 and bringing the total customer base to 1.47 million, up 11% year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 7,000 direct customers bringing the total number of direct customers to 233,000, a 15% year-over-year increase. Turning to our third strategic pillar. We delivered strong margin expansion and healthy cash flow during Q3, highlighting our focus on operating and financial efficiency. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 83% in line with the prior year. Third quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 86% also in line with the prior year. Q3 non-GAAP operating income reached a record $187 million, representing a 27% margin, up nearly 400 basis points from 23% and $147 million in the prior year. During the quarter, we increased focus on investment prioritization, hiring plans and operating expenses. There will be continuing opportunities for greater efficiency even as we invest to drive long-term growth. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, a $0.22 per share improvement from $0.57 last year. We ended Q3 with 6,945 employees compared to 7,522 the year prior and up from 6,748 in Q2. We will remain disciplined with our head count investment. Hiring will continue to focus on opportunities to drive sustainable long-term growth like those in R&D. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $264 million compared with $53 million in the same quarter last year. While an ERP transition impacted last year's cash flow results, I'm proud of the significant free cash flow we generated this quarter. Third quarter free cash flow was a record $240 million representing a 34% margin compared with $36 million or 6% a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $750 million in free cash flow, underscoring the strong fundamentals of this business. With regards to the balance sheet, we exited Q3 with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This includes the repayment of $37 million of convertible debt that matured during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to address the remaining convertible debt of $690 million that matures next month. Turning to our share repurchase program. We redeployed excess capital during the quarter and repurchased 1.8 million shares for approximately $75 million. In addition to our share repurchase program, during the quarter, we used $36 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the diluted impact of our equity programs. We remain committed to opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $696 million to $700 million in Q4 or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and $2.746 billion to $2.750 billion for fiscal '24 or a 9% year-over-year increase. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $679 million to $683 million in Q4 or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and $2.670 billion to $2.674 billion for fiscal '24 or a 9% year-over-year increase. For billings, we expect $758 million to $768 million in Q4 or a 3% growth rate year-over-year at the midpoint and $2.835 billion to $2.845 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for Q4 and 81.5% to 82.5% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 22.5% to 23.5% for Q4 and 24% to 25% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $207 million to $212 million for both Q4 and fiscal '24. In closing, we're pleased to report a quarter of consistent execution against our three strategic pillars accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market strategy and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. We have a strong foundation with well over 1 million customer relationships and improving product momentum. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by investing in durable long-term growth, delivering on our profitability goals and generating sustainable free cash flow. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we focus on helping our customers accelerate their business growth, mitigate risk and enable customer experiences that are easier and more delightful. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Sure. I'll take a stab at this and Allan, if you want to jump in, feel free. So just a quick reminder, dollar net retention or DNR is our direct business only in greater than one year. Like you said, the trend downwards in line with our previous communications. And as covered in our prepared remarks, for me, we have -- we expect to see continued pressure in Q4. It's a tough macro environment still where companies continue to scrutinize investments and leading to smaller expansion opportunities for us. It's a bit of a lagging indicator. So the thing that I'm focused on mostly and the company is focused on is what are the efforts we're making to stabilize and improve it over the longer term. And so -- like you said, things like the intelligent agreement management and the new product innovation, including CLM and pricing and packaging enhancements and stronger PLG motions that we're working on in self-serve, which can help us improve those win or renewal weights, if you will, over time is what we're focused on. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, we are seeing some very early signs of potential, I would call it, cost of optimism, right? Like consumption up across a number of verticals. We saw sticky future adoption improve from last quarter on a year-over-year basis. And that's the percentage of our direct customers using five or more kind of incremental features that was at 58% in Q3, up from Q2, and it was up about 12 points year-over-year. So they're just -- the early signs of potential optimism, but I think it's too early for us to put any type of a target or a specific time line out there. But focusing on those product management efforts and those go-to-market efforts, I think, is how we get excited about the future. Sure. I appreciate the question. So with regards to the outperformance on the operating margin, we made a concerted effort, I would say, starting kind of like late September to inspect and rationalize investments across the business. It's really just about increasing focus on, what I would call, disciplined spending while we continue to invest in the areas that where we have longer-term growth aspirations. During Q3, we prioritize investments. And so that includes the rate of hiring, the value opportunities for organizational efficiency, but then also overall operating expenses with focus on leveraging existing resources where possible, but still being able to invest for longer-term growth. With regard to your question on the trajectory and the investment philosophy, we're all big believers here in a balanced outlook, which is we need to be able to invest to get the long-term growth and achieve those aspirations that we have. But at the same point in time, we need to be efficient and productive with the assets that we have. And so I really am proud of the team for embracing that. And so I don't think no investment, I would say, philosophy changes from our part. But I would just say a little bit maybe kind of more executed focus on that for us and we were able to show some pretty good performance, I think, this quarter and I'm really proud of the team for that level of execution. Sure. So I'll take a stab at that. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in a short period of time. When I say that, I mean across our business, both in just operational efficiency but also accelerating product evolution and innovation. In Q3, particularly, we improved operating margins, we generated significant free cash flow. And I think we're evolving our mind-set across the company. As I mentioned earlier on the question that was just asked before this, in terms of our long-term approach, we're going to balance driving durable long-term growth with operating efficiency. Top of our priority is to make the right strategic investments to drive business momentum and, frankly, to billings, which is, I think, what you're referring to in the coming years. And it doesn't happen overnight, especially at the business of the scale. But we believe we have the right product and go-to-market focus and we've got a good leadership team in place to make that happen. And you alluded to this, but given that we're still working through our planning and forecasting process for next year. We'll provide our standard formal fiscal year '25 outlook in our Q4 earnings call three months from now. But as you think about next year, I imagine you want to consider the Q4 exit rate trends as you think about next year and at the same time, we believe there's further opportunity to drive improved efficiency. In our existing business and our operating expenses and then also taking into account historical seasonality changes as we go from Q4 to Q1 with fewer days in the quarter and things like that, just all kind of the basics that you would want to pay attention to. But other than that, we'll provide our full year -- our fiscal '25 formal guidance in our next quarter's call. Sure. So I mean I think the philosophy on stock-based comp is generally you want to be able to provide the incentive and the ability to attract and retain the best talent possible to allow us to reach the aspirations for growth that we want to get to. I know that I think our stock-based comp as a percentage of revenue in the current quarter I think was 23%. I think that was up slightly year-over-year from '22. I would say that the driver of the increase is really most about the new management team. So it's driven by the executive comp that drove that year-over-year increase, not necessarily the other part of the company. I think that, for us, it's something we're slightly above our peer average, and so it's something that we are paying attention to. But it's a balanced approach, again, right? We want to be able to attract and retain the right people for the job that -- so we can get into this next chapter of growth for DocuSign. But it is something we pay attention to and are looking at. Sure. And it's a good question. Thanks for asking. So when we talk about consumption today, it's primarily around the e-signature space, primarily around, if you will, the envelopes that are used. So what is the usage by our customers on a year-over-year basis. So those verticals that I highlighted at some of the stronger year-over-year growth in consumption that we've seen over the past quarter or two. So I think we're, again, cautiously optimistic about it. And just to be clear, too, there's still verticals that are more challenged, right? I highlighted financial services is one, and I also highlight real estate as the other one, which probably comes as no surprise to folks who are living in this interest rate environment. I think the thing that makes me -- I don't want to say happier, but you can see a little bit of light there is that real estate has improved on a year-over-year basis over the past three quarters. So that's good, but it's not anywhere back to near where it was I would say prior to the whole interest rate challenges that we've kind of entered into the past year or so. But so excited about that, but again, that's also, I think, in the prepared remarks, I made a comment about the significant remaining opportunity. And so a lot of it, I think, you're probably seeing is that as the macro environment returns to more normalcy in certain verticals, then we believe we're a beneficiary of that. And I think that's relevant because we have such a broad-based set of verticals in such a diverse customer base as well. So it's something that when things improve, we think we're a beneficiary of that. And your guess is probably as good or better than mine on when that happens. Go ahead. Yes, you bet. So, right, Q3 billings growth of 5% relative to Q2 of 10% year-over-year. Still really pleased with the Q3. We came in above our expectations on that. But the detail like you're asking about from Q2 to Q3, it's really driven, I would say, by three primary areas. The first is we have a hard comp in Q3. If you look back at our historical results, I think our Q3 billings growth in fiscal '23 was up 17% -- around 17% year-over-year. And that was the highest in fiscal '23. And that was driven by a year ago, we had a pretty strong early renewals kind of momentum that grew that billings number in Q2 the prior year. Now we're still doing well this year with regard to our renewals, it's just a hard comp that we're having to deal with. The second thing item is what you talked about, which is that on-time renewal impact. And as I discussed in the last call and my predecessor discussed on the call before that, the benefit that we've had in the higher on-time renewals in the first half of '24. It just -- you have a smaller impact as you go through the year in the second half. And so it's really primarily a timing issue. And so we're still doing actually really quite well on on-time renewal execution. The team is doing a great job with it. It's just a smaller impact on year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. And then the final -- the third thing that impacts that billings number, frankly, is just lower expansion rates, right? I mean IT budget scrutiny and people that are sitting in my seat are asking the right questions, which is how do I do more with less, where are the places that I can manage costs well, it's -- I mean, I'm doing it here, frankly, in my role as an operational CFO. And that, along with macro impacts overall billings growth, and it's evident in those DNR rates. But as Allan mentioned and I have mentioned already, like we are seeing those consumption trends that we saw some marginal improvement quarter-over-quarter. And it's still early for us. We got to see that hopefully hold here for the next few quarters. But things are also improving, but that's just really the dynamics of the decel and year-over-year growth between Q2 and Q3. Sure. So, yes, really happy with the $240 million cash flow that was generated this quarter. It's a combination of just ongoing strong operating results. But we also did have some working capital improvements that impacted that number. When you look at the cash flow statement, you're going to see there the changes in operating assets and liabilities, and we've really had a strong improvement on the collection side on an AR. And so that's great. And so that it drives it. And then I said this in the prepared remarks, comparing to prior year can be a little tricky because of the ERP transition that happened prior year. So we had a more muted free cash flow generation number. But regardless of that, really excited about the free cash flow we got. Now to your question on the yield, it was really strong. It was 34%. And while I'm a big fan of the working capital tailwind and I'm really proud of the team for the discipline and the improvements there, that can be something that's challenging, right, to pile onto every year going forward. There's always some good working capital improvements you can make. But I think that if you think about this business in the long-term, it's probably fair to assume that your free cash flow yield trends a lot closer to your operating margin yield. So as long as you make operating margin improvements, you should be able to capture most of that right down to the free cash flow line. But then also in this business, the beauty of this business from a free cash flow perspective is that if you can drive operating margin improvement and you can drive reaccelerated billings growth because of the way our working capital works, your free cash flow generation can really accelerate. And so like this is a much longer-term period that I'm talking about, but it is the power of this model, which is super exciting. And so I do think, though, like, I mean I think in the span of time, you would think free cash flow yield should trend closer to your operating margin deal that we've been. We've done better than that and free cash flow pretty significantly better than that in free cash flow this quarter, but it's mostly on the back of those working capital improvements or not mostly, but a large chunk of it. And so you have to be cautious about assuming that you're going to expand on those every quarter. Yes. Just to follow up. My general philosophy is I don't make macro forecast as a team because just like I think we joked about it earlier on the call, it's a hard business to get into. And so we forecast what we see. And so if things were to change one way or the other, we would then have to -- we'd speak to that variance."

            "name": "Allan Thygesen",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. DocuSign's third quarter operating results reflect progress on our initiatives to expand beyond e-signature into agreement management. And our financial performance underscores our ongoing focus on driving profitability and sustaining healthy free cash flow. As I reflect on our journey over the last 12 months, the three key pillars of our strategic vision remain the same. First, to accelerate innovation towards agreement management, which we believe will further expand market opportunity; second, improving the reach and efficiency of our omnichannel go-to-market efforts; and third, strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. Now before we discuss each pillar in detail, let me first highlight this quarter's financial results. Total Q3 revenue came in at $700 million, up 9% versus prior year. We're particularly pleased with the improvement in our overall profitability this quarter against persistent macro headwinds and delayed at customer caution. Specifically, our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, a 400 basis point increase versus prior year and non-GAAP operating income grew 27% year-over-year to $187 million. We also generated record free cash flow in Q3 coming in at $240 million, up significantly versus the prior year. We're focused on strengthening our profitability while making balanced investments in areas with strong long-term growth opportunities. We're also seeing encouraging signs of business stabilization. With improvement in some metrics, notably customers with annualized contract value greater than $300,000. Blake will expand on the metrics further in his remarks. With respect to our first pillar, accelerating product innovation. Our focus is twofold. First, we continue to improve our core e-signature product capability. In Q3, DocuSign became the exclusive e-signature provider for Microsoft's Power Page Integration, making it easy for website makers to incorporate signatures and forms without code, improving the client signing experience and opening the door to building pre and post signature workflows. In November, we also launched a WhatsApp integration for e-signature. In an internal comparative study, we found that agreements delivered via WhatsApp are signed nearly seven times faster than those sent via e-mail. Given the ubiquity of WhatsApp globally, it's an important update to bring e-signature to markets outside the US. In addition, IDC recognized DocuSign as a leader in its 2023 e-signature assessment. DocuSign continues to hold the leadership position of IDC for e-signature based on having a complete portfolio of solutions for customers. And we're seeing existing customers grow and expand their use cases. Hantz Group, which is a Michigan-based wealth management firm is using e-signature to deliver a fully digital experience for its clients through a proprietary mobile app and is expanding their use of DocuSign products with notary, SMS, identity verification and monitoring. Our APIs and strength and compliance made DocuSign the best choice for Hantz and they've made DocuSign the standard across their entire organization, which will approximately double their use of our products. Second, we're also investing towards broadening our value proposition beyond e-signature and into agreement management. In Q3, we shipped embedded agreements that deliver a seamless signing experience directly on our customers' websites and applications. In addition, we launched Microsoft Power Automate for the generation of personalized professional-looking documents for signing directly from Microsoft Power Automate flows. We also launched foundational features and functionality that help us expand beyond e-signature into wide-scale agreement management. These features deliver customer delight and remove friction from all aspects of the agreement process. We see the success of CLM as a proof point that there are broader agreement management use cases to address the customers of all sizes. CLM continues to grow well, particularly with North American enterprise customers. And for the fourth year in a row, our CLM solution was recognized as a leader by Gartner in contract life cycle management. Noting our strong market understanding, product strategy and road map vision, including upcoming Generative AI enhancements. This quarter, we expanded a relationship that began more than five years ago with Veeco USA, who's the leader in workplace innovation. Veeco began using DocuSign e-signature and has added CLM as part of this transformation into a digital services company. Our AI solution will help Veeco streamline and enhance search and review of executed customer contracts with actionable insights to better serve its customers. Thank you to our partners at Spaulding Ridge, who are helping to strengthen our commitment and partnership with Veeco. As we look ahead, we envision serving similar customer needs not addressed by CLM via a broader agreement management platform designed for all of our customers in all segments. We are previewing with slide customer now and will have much more to share on our product road map and strategic vision at our Momentum User Conference in April 2024. Across both our e-signature core and future agreement management products, we believe our investment will lead to even further differentiation in a competitive market. We're encouraged by steady win rates and excited for the impact we can create for customers. This past quarter also demonstrated execution against our second pillar, improved omnichannel go-to-market where we gained traction across our direct sales, digital and partner engagement. Our international business spans all channels as an important part of our addressable market. It's really an untapped opportunity for DocuSign expansion. In Q3, our international revenue grew approximately three times faster than our North American business. We also saw traction in the adoption of our Identity education solutions, which meet stringent regulatory standards in the EU and elsewhere. And in Q3, we launched a Japanese localized version of our CLM product. The recently launched WhatsApp integration also highlights our international ambitions. Our digital channel once again grew at a faster rate than our direct business during the quarter, a strong sign that our product-led growth initiative continues to drive new customer acquisition and top of funnel activity. We continue to optimize our site and remove friction from the try-and-buy journey while creating a more personalized experience with improved localization. We're seeing particular strength in new customer acquisition in our international markets as well as improved conversion rates in the trial to pay license purchase conversion rates. Our trusted brand and product strength continue to be assets for our direct sales team. Mountain America Credit Union, one of the biggest credit unions in the US has reduced the time it takes to close a credit card application by 30% by integrating DocuSign with its proprietary loan origination system. Mountain America switched to DocuSign from a different electronic signature provider in part because our strong brand reputation inspires confidence from its members, but also because our rich catalog of best-in-class APIs give its developers the flexibility to create solutions that are customized to its exact needs. That is enabling Mountain America to deliver a seamless, minimal click experience that aligns with the standards as members expect in their financial institutions. An important pillar of our go-to-market plan is strengthening our partner ecosystem. In October, we hosted our first ever partner day. It was fantastic to meet with our system integrators, resellers and software vendors from around the world, sharing our commitment to growing our business together. As an example, the ISV Embed pay-as-you-go initiative we announced in Q2 is accelerating and driving new customer wins. Before I pass it to Blake, I want to address some progress on our third strategic pillar. Our company's focus on financial and operational efficiency. In the quarter, we delivered record operating margin and free cash flow. While we continue to invest for long-term growth, we will also continue to be strong financial stewards of the business. We still have a lot of work to do, but I am pleased with our progress over the past 12 months. I am more confident than ever in the value we can create for our customers in our business and the scale and strength of our customer base. We're in the early stages of our journey to expand beyond e-signature into agreement management. But there is very concrete customer validation of the market opportunity and meaningful progress towards our goals. Thank you to the DocuSign team who's inspired me with their commitment to this transformation. With that, let me turn it over to Blake. Yes, I'll take a crack at that. So first, I'd say that if you look -- if you think about our broader vision, CLM is really a leading indicator or early instantiation of our broader vision for intelligent agreement management. It is very heavily focused on the enterprise. And I think we and everyone else providing CLM solutions have been held back by the required significant services and customization investment that the current generation of CLM products mandate. And so our opportunity is to make that significantly more lightweight and delightful, lowering the bar for companies of all sizes really to take advantage of that platform. That is a huge part of our focus right now. We're in early access on some important pieces of that. And so over the next few quarters, you will see that going to roll out to a much broader set of customers than CLM and DocuSign or any other vendor can address today. And we think that unlocks opportunity, as I said, everywhere. Thank you. Yes, I would just echo, if I can just echo Blake's point that the entire management team, not just like is very focused on this balance that he referenced. We absolutely want to free up capital and that is a team effort to look everywhere in the company to free up resources where we can then invest more particularly on the product side. We did some of that earlier this year, as you know, but it's an ongoing continuous effort, not just a onetime thing, and I think that's reflected in the results. Yes, I would just add, we have that. We discussed that topic with the Board and the Compensation Committee and we will share our longer-term plans, but our goal, as Blake said is to manage it down over time without fundamentally disrupting our ability to execute. It was necessary to attract a new management team and to rebalance our employees following the stock decline, but I think we think we're in a more normalized set now, and we should be able to manage to something more towards the benchmarks. Yes. Well, so I think you all know, we acquire a tremendous number of new customers every quarter. And most of those, vast majority of those come in via our website and onboard themselves. And then over time, we grow them. And as they show potential and opportunity, then we engage them with our sales teams and our support to customer success teams. I would say that our digital motion has made significant improvements during the course of this year. So for customers that are in essence natively digital, we have improved that part of the funnel, not only you can buy more things, you can upgrade your existing plans. All of that stuff is working much better now. We're adding more international currencies every quarter. So all of those things are helping improve the performance of our digital business. In addition to that, we are in the process of building out ability for customers who are currently serviced through our sales teams to handle a number of activities themselves without human assistance. And that is very -- has very high leverage both in terms of providing a better offering to our customers and in terms of freeing up our sales teams to work on higher-value work. But I think we still have some quarters to go on implementing that and seeing the full benefit of that. So the benefits of this self-serve PLG project continue to accrue and will accrue into next year. But we're seeing really good progress in that business is growing faster than our direct business. And it's improving on most performance metrics. So that's, yes, very happy with the progress there. Yes, there's not much more, I would say, a level of detail that we're going to disclose publicly about it. I think it's just for us that it's a metric that we know if we can deliver on the product innovation and the road map and the self-service and the PLG motions that we have in front of us, we really believe we've got a chance to stabilize that metric and then reverse that trend. Now for us, that's top of mind. Obviously, it is a lagging metric, so there's time that you're going to -- it's going to take to see that occur. But I would say there was nothing that spoke out about Q3 that stood out that I would call it different than the prior quarter or two. I don't know if any of us -- No, that one maybe not. And I'll just add to what Blake said, I think consumption -- we think of consumption as an imperfect but important leading and predictive indicator of renewal. And so that's why we track it closely and we're talking about it. And we're seeing modestly encouraging signs there in consumption trends relative to the commitments customers have made. Maybe one other comment on that is we are also coming to the end of the COVID. We have a few quarters left of COVID renewals, but it is already significantly down and weight in our business and so that's coming to an end, which is positive. Yes, there's several points in there. First, I'd just say, look, our CLM business is growing faster than our signature business, and I expect as we launch this broader intelligent agreement management platform to a broader set of customers that pattern of that broader category growing faster will continue. The second point you made about the envelope versus subscription basis. We are, in fact, already experimenting with should we say, unlimited envelope billing models for a variety of customers. So for very large customers, we have entered into some enterprise license agreements. And those have been, I think, quite helpful at one very large bank that we did one with as they, after they signed that agreement, they proceeded to remove a competing solution from some of their workflows. And I think we have that opportunity across some of our very large customers. And then in the Commercial segment, the mid-market and SMB segment, we're now competing more directly with some of our lower-priced competitors who have offered unlimited envelope packages. And not surprisingly, if you give people a competitive unlimited envelope from DocuSign versus a lesser branded, less well featured product then they choose DocuSign. And so we're seeing really, really positive results and to the point where I expect that we will continue to broaden that rollout. So overall, I'm feeling quite good about our evolution and our response to competition on multiple fronts as well as the broadening of our product road map that you alluded to in the first part of your question. Yes. I'll just start, and Blake, you can add. Look, I think in terms of the mix impact of financial services, I think, that's mostly behind us, but we have experienced that over the last several years, both on the mortgage side and financial services industry. And we saw some in the smaller banks, for example, that IT spend froze with all the turmoil in the spring, some of the very largest banks have also had particularly aggressive cost management efforts. I'd say, overall, we've seen some modest recovery. It's still growing a little slower than the business overall, but trending better. And we'll see what happens with interest rates. Our current forecast assumes that macro conditions continue as they are. I recognize there's optimism they may get better. We'd love that, but we don't want to move that in our guidance. I think our relationship with Salesforce is as strong as ever. We renewed our strategic partnership this summer. I was just over there meeting with one of the senior executives yesterday. It's a very healthy relationship at every level. And we have probably more -- we have certainly a more Salesforce-enabled business than with any other software partner and that includes other very large software companies. So Salesforce has been a trading partner, and they remain that. On the CLM side, yes, they certainly have a contract offering covering out. They previously offered that in their vertical products, and now they're generalizing it somewhat. I think that the challenge is that the market is moving to a horizontal model by which I mean 2/3 almost of all the CLM RFPs that we see are for cross-functional contract management. In other words, a single centralized contract management system across, let's say, procurement front of the house, HR, et cetera. And that will be hard for Salesforce or other even very large companies that are focused on one particular workflow or another. And so I expect that we will continue to collaborate very closely with Salesforce on both the signature side and the CLM side. And I'm not too worried about the sales force contracts piece, but never under estimate Salesforce. They're a fantastic company and partner. Yes. It's actually a full omnichannel thing and it's very market context specific. So first of all, we have a substantial amount of direct sales teams deployed in some of the major international markets UK, France, Germany, Australia, and we service Canada, obviously, Brazil, a meaningful size team there as well and a spattering of folks in other markets. So historically that was our principal go-to-market model. We're now really balancing that across direct investment where we can put enough wood behind the arrow and there's enough return on that investment. And then a combination of a digital motion which we can obviously serve 180 countries that way. And then a partner motion in countries where we -- where it makes sense to leave with that. So you took a smaller developing market, let's say, it wouldn't make sense for us to put a direct sales team on the ground, but we wouldn't be able to fully exploit the opportunity strictly through a digital-only motion. And so I think we have tremendous opportunity on both of those fronts. And we are seeing growth both in our digital channels, where international is growing faster than domestic and in our direct channels where it's growing faster than domestic. So we'll continue on that. Just to return to a theme from prior calls, as we looked at prioritization and where we're really going to put additional investment, both from a direct sales standpoint, but also in all the various supporting functions that are necessary to really have an effective go-to-market motion. We prioritized investing in Germany and Japan, which were markets that where we had some level of direct sales investment but we hadn't invested as aggressively in marketing and back-office functions like legal and finance or in product. And so that has been a priority since the spring. And we're making really good progress in both of those markets. I mentioned last time, we opened our office in Munich. We have an office in Tokyo. We have launched localized products for several of those markets mentioned the Japanese CLM product that we shipped here a couple of months ago, a lot of the identity verification stuff, and more stuff coming here shortly in that realm, very targeted at the EU in general, in Germany, in particular. And so we are investing aggressively I would say in a direct sales motion maybe our top 10 markets globally and then a combination of partner and digital throughout other markets where we can. There'll be some very long tail countries where we can only serve with a digital motion, but that's how we approach it. Yes. I think the dynamic is as I've described in the previous quarters, I don't see a material change. So with larger clients, we may see local competitors in certain international markets, Adobe and some of them and then the smaller clients, it's just mattering of a variety of names that are maybe less familiar. And I think we are -- I'm not seeing any change in our win rates in competitive deals. And I'm cautiously optimistic with some of the initiatives I referenced earlier in terms of our new pricing and packaging that we are responding pretty effectively at both ends of the market. And then lastly, I just mentioned at the very low end, if you will, where it's really being embedded in workflows. We've dramatically upgraded our solutions for ISVs to embed DocuSign, and we've adopted a more flexible billing model that we refer to as pay-as-you-go and that saw some very nice accelerated growth here since the launch in Q2. So, on multiple fronts, I'm feeling that we're doing pretty well, and I'm not seeing a material change in the competitive dynamic. Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining today's call. So this quarter, DocuSign was especially effective at making progress on our product initiatives while balancing those investments with operational efficiency. So we are continuing to build on our considerable scale as we expand beyond e-signature into intelligent agreement management. Thanks for your time. Look forward to seeing all of you next quarter."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Alan. Alan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed out the first half of the year strong by delivering solid second quarter financial results. We continue to drive momentum in our business by making progress against our key initiatives and delivering enhancements to our product portfolio. Exiting the quarter, I feel energized, having recently come off our momentum events where we visited eight cities spanning five continents. We met with thousands of partners and customers who are excited to hear about our dual track plans to improve agreement workflows. In the near-term, we're focused on the agreement management layer. We're taking something that's quite complex for our customers and making it easier and more delightful. And over-time, we're building the intelligence layer that will unlock agreement data. We presented our future vision, publicly shared our product roadmap and received tremendous validation after showcasing product demonstrations aligned to these two priorities over the quarter. Let me share some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q2 total revenue came in at $688 million, up 11% versus prior year and Q2 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 25%. While we are pleased with our results, like many others, we are seeing continued macro pressures tempering expansion rates. However, we remain focused on what we can control, executing against our initiatives to drive innovation and operational efficiency, further setting the foundation for growth while navigating an uncertain environment. Now I want to highlight our pace of innovation driven by our delivery of new features and products. The progress we're making demonstrates how we are expanding upon our leadership in eSignature. As I said, we're thinking about our roadmap on two horizons. In the short-term, we're looking to ship new features and functionality that differentiate DocuSign and streamline agreement workflows, bringing in new customers and continuing to deliver value to existing customers. To that end, we continue to expand our identity verification portfolio announcing the global launch of Liveness Detection for ID Verification. Liveness Detection technology leverages AI-powered biometric checks to prevent identity spoofing which results in more accurate verification without the signee being present. ID Verification is already helping our customers. Our data shows that it has reduced time to sign by about 60%. Later this year, we expect to expand our functionality with a wallet feature that will enable frequent users to save their profile, driving improved efficiency and convenience. These add-ons will be available for all of our plans, including our standard plan representing an important differentiator for DocuSign's product offering for all customer types. As I've stated in the past, the value of an agreement is in the data and every step of the workflow will benefit when it's automated, intelligent and seamlessly integrated into core businesses. Web Forms is delivering on that vision. During the quarter, we shipped and announced more and increasingly sophisticated capabilities to our Web Forms offering. In July, Web Forms became available on DocuSign FedRAMP moderate environment, which unlocks new possibilities for our federal state and local government customers to digitize their forms. We also soon ship advanced reporting capabilities, enabling users to unlock data from their agreements to uncover actionable insights and drive data-driven decisions. This quarter we also announced that DocuSign Monitor is now available to our CLM customers. Monitor provides a comprehensive and holistic multiproduct view of user activity on one dashboard for both CLM and eSignature ensuring organizations can quickly and easily detect, investigate and respond to suspicious activity before incidents occur. For our customers, it's powerful reassurance. Losing even one high-value agreement can have a significant business impact. We are seeing large marquee organizations across industries, including tech and finance, like DocuSign CLM to transform how they automate their end-to-end agreement processes across their entire enterprise. As an example, we closed one of our largest CLM deals ever. This customer is a leading residential solar company turn to our CLM solutions to help automate over 1,200 of their agreement templates, leveraging our document generation and workflow management capabilities. CLM helps them automate their agreement process across teams, adding simplicity and security. Our CLM today represents a small contribution to our overall business. We saw solid year-on-year growth, which is a reflection of our leading market position. We are encouraged by the wins and we have just begun to tap into the potential for this market. More broadly, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our vision of smart agreements. Before we discuss our final update, it's worth grounding this portion with a reminder of what's generally true in the market. Individual solutions work but customers suffer when putting together solutions combining different product categories like CLM, eSignature, workflow management, document storage and so on. Today only the largest enterprises with resources and IT sophistication can link these solutions together and only a significant expense. This depresses the overall consumption and size of market. We are on a multi-quarter path to evolve our offerings towards a platform capable of coordinating broader processes at a fraction of current complexity. Our goal is to unlock the market for intelligent agreement management from millions of businesses, automating billions of hours of manual work and improving business outcomes. Today, we are already monetizing AI directly through our CLM plus products and indirectly through its use in our products such as search. Our next step on that journey is with AI labs. With AI labs, we are co-innovating with our customers. We provide a sandbox where customers can share a select subset of agreements find new features we're testing. Our customers get early access to developing technology and we receive early feedback that we will incorporate into our products. By working with our customers in the development phase, we're further reinforcing the trusted position we've earned over the last 20 years. Next, let me provide an update on the progress we're making with our go-to-market capabilities, balancing scale with efficiency. As we evolve how DocuSign goes to market, integrating our digital direct and partner selling motions to leverage an omnichannel approach. I'd like to provide an update on the progress we're making in our self-serve product like growth channel. The PLG and self-serve capabilities are one of our most important areas of investment. In addition to our continued focus on delivering against our product road map, we're improving our customer experience by making DocuSign products much easier to try and buy. With such a diversified customer base, it's critical that we deliver delightful self-service experiences, not just for growth, but also for scale and efficiency. We made good traction over the quarter, noting higher traffic conversion rates of new customers on our website. We've also unlocked expansion opportunities for customers directly within their product experience, resulting in relative strength through our digital channel. We expanded relationships with our partner ecosystem, which is an important part of our omnichannel approach to drive reach and scale. In Q2, we launched pay-as-you-go offering for our ISV partners, enables ISVs to embed DocuSign eSignature in their agreement workflows on a consumption basis. Over the course of the next few months, we will have been featured partners in some of the most important technical conferences, most notably at Google Next, Dreamforce, Deutsche Telekom's Digital X and Microsoft Ignite. One of the key pillars of our omnichannel is strengthening our direct sales productivity. This was the second consecutive quarter of a higher-than-anticipated rate of on-time renewals, which is a positive sign of increasing go-to-market execution. It's contributed favorably to our billings outperformance for the quarter, which Blake will touch on in the financial update. In our international business, expansion remains the largest part of our addressable market, and we are making progress. This past quarter, one of Australia's largest banks expanded their relationship with us. Customers since 2020, they use our solutions to streamline both internal and customer-facing business processes in an effort to remove friction, reduce cost and deliver better experiences. The upside potential in our international business is large. And as I had commented on previously, we met with hundreds of our international customers through DocuSign's Momentum Events. The excitement about our product road map was contagious, and we look forward to growing our presence globally. We are shaping the future of the agreement category and building on our global scale and trusted market position. The future of agreements is not about attaching yourself to a legacy document format. As we continue our product evolution by adding intelligence and unlocking the data trapped in agreements, we're increasing productivity, reducing friction and saving our customers' time. This is a fundamental shift in the agreement space. I'm confident in our competitive advantage as DocuSign is the largest player, focused solely on improving the agreement process. Moreover, there's no other company focused on the full end-to-end agreement process for companies of every size from SMBs up to the world's largest enterprises. In closing, I want to thank DocuSign's employees worldwide for their collective power in driving our success. I'm proud of the tremendous job the team has done navigating the dynamic environment. I'd now like to welcome Blake Grayson, who, as you know, joined us in mid-June as our CFO. Blake has proven to be a valuable addition to our team, and I look forward to our continued partnership. Let me turn it over to Blake to review our financial performance.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Allan, for the kind words, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to join my first earnings call as DocuSign's CFO. Over the last few months, I've gained considerable exposure into the workings of our business and value proposition as we look to transform agreement workflows. First, I'd like to share what led me to join DocuSign. DocuSign has a powerful brand and a scale in our customer base that is rare in the enterprise software space. We deliver high ROI products that enable our customers to complete agreements faster, easier and more securely. The opportunity for our business is quite large. And while I am optimistic about our future, we still have work to do to achieve our goals, particularly in a demand environment where companies are appropriately scrutinizing their investments. With that, let me turn to our Q2 results. For the second quarter, total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $688 million, and subscription revenue also grew 11% year-over-year to $669 million. Our international revenue growth outpaced our domestic business with 17% year-over-year growth to reach $180 million in the second quarter, representing 26% of our total revenue. When I think about the market opportunity ahead, I'm excited by the greenfield space that exists internationally. It is a largely untapped market and a key pillar of future growth. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we work to increase our footprint globally. Second quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $711 million. Similar to last quarter, our Q2 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. It is encouraging to see us maintain the higher level of sales execution we saw in Q1 through the first half of the year. However, given the macro environment and headwinds and some expansion metrics, we continue to expect billings growth deceleration in the back half of the year, which is in line with our previously communicated expectations. We added approximately 37,000 new customers during the quarter, which brings our total customer base to 1.44 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 6,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 226,000, an 18% year-over-year increase. We also saw a 6% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value exceeding $300,000 with a total of 1,047 customers. Similar to last quarter, the quarter-on-quarter decline in this customer segment was primarily related to customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. However, as we ship innovative features to deepen our product line-up and differentiate our offerings, more customers are recognizing the value of adopting our features and frictionless functionality. This increases product stickiness and we are pleased that over 50% of our direct customers have now adopted five or more features, an increase of nearly 10 points year-over-year. Dollar net retention was 102% for the quarter. We're seeing continued macro pressures resulting in moderated expansion rates. And as we expect customers to continue scrutinizing budgets and optimizing spend, we anticipate the Q3 dollar net retention rate to trend downward. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within health care, insurance and business services. One of the most significant strengths I've gained insight into is DocuSign's broad and diverse customer base, which enables us to help offset pressures from verticals that are more sensitive to the interest rate environment, such as real estate. Given the large breadth and depth of our installed base and the investments we're making in product innovation, we believe that as the macro environment stabilizes or improves, DocuSign will be well positioned to capture expansion opportunities. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 82%, in line with the prior year. Second quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with the prior year. Q2 non-GAAP operating income reached $170 million, up 51% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% was up nearly 700 basis points compared to 18% last year. As discussed on last quarter's call, we are executing against our investment plan. Our philosophy on vesting is consistent. We'll maintain continued disciplined investments to drive growth in our top line over time. Although we expect to ramp investment in the back half of this year, we still expect to exit the year with operating margins better than they were prior to our restructuring efforts. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72, an improvement of $0.28 from last year of $0.44. We ended Q2 with 6,748 employees compared to 8,061 the year prior. Second quarter operating cash flow was $211 million, representing a 31% margin and an increase of 75% versus the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was also up 74% year-over-year coming in at $184 million, representing a 27% margin. As I'm learning more about the business, I am impressed with our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. With regards to the balance sheet, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We currently have approximately $725 million in convertible debt that will be maturing over the next few months. Our strong cash position is a reflection of the operating leverage in our business model that provides a strong level of flexibility. And as we think about utilizing this cash, we will do so thoughtfully ensuring our capital is strategically deployed. Related to this, we redeployed excess capital during the quarter and repurchased 583,000 shares for approximately $30 million. We also announced today that we are increasing the size of our share repurchase program to $500 million, up from $200 million as we continue to focus on being opportunistic, reducing dilution and returning excess capital to shareholders as appropriate. In addition to our share repurchase program, during the quarter, we used $40 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact of our equity programs. With that, let me turn to our Q3 and fiscal '24 guidance. To reiterate, while we're pleased with our Q2 financial results, we're also cautious in light of an uncertain macro environment and competitive dynamics. For the third quarter and fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $687 million to $691 million in Q3 or a 6% to 7% year-over-year increase and $2.725 billion to $2.737 billion for fiscal '24 or an 8% to 9% year-over-year increase. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $669 million to $673 million in Q3 or a 7% to 8% year-over-year increase and $2.649 billion to $2.661 billion for fiscal '24 or an 8% to 9% year-over-year increase. For billings, we expect $668 million to $678 million in Q3 or a 1% to 3% growth rate year-over-year and $2.804 billion to $2.824 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 5% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q3 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 22% to 23% for Q3 and 23% to 24% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q3 and fiscal '24. In closing, I want to thank our team for their warm welcome and their commitment to work with our customers in a challenging environment and I look forward to connecting with many of you in the near future. We are focused on executing against the key initiatives that we believe will drive future long-term growth and expansion as well as being mindful of efficiency opportunities that will set us up for profitable, sustainable growth. As Allan mentioned, we are the only company at scale that is solely focused on helping customers improve the agreement process. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we continue to evolve the agreement workflow category and help our customers become more productive and more efficient. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSonak Kolar: Great. This is Sonak Kolar on for Mark Murphy. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the healthy execution this quarter. Allan just so quickly on the AI front. You discussed a number of the exciting AI product launches you had at the recent Momentum Conference. Are there any specific products you would call out in which you see the greatest incremental monetization or upsell potential longer term, whether that's around ID Verification, agreement summarization or some of the other areas, for example?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Look, I think we think AI will impact practically all of our products at every step with the agreement workflow. So I don't know that there's a -- just a one call out. But maybe to rattle off a couple that I'm most interested in. I certainly think that the broader, should we say, agreement analytics category is poised to be completely revamped with Generative AI. We were an early investor in that category. We saw that coming together with CLM four or five years ago and made a couple of strategic investments and been a leader in that space, but have been held back by fundamental technology. And I think now with Generative AI, we can do a substantially better job more seamlessly, lighter weight with less professional services. And so I'm very excited to think about how it transformed the CLM category and enables us to deliver more intelligent agreements. I think you mentioned IDV. I agree 100%. Fundamentally, that entire category is AI-enabled. The upload and ingestion of your ID recognition of it and then that Liveness Detection where we're detecting who you are and that you are present and matching that to ID, that would simply not be possible without today's AI technology and really takes just dramatically reshapes the ability to trade off risk and convenience. So I think that's a good one. And but I really do think that it works across the entire flow. We use it today. And when you use DocuSign eSignature today, we automatically recognize your field. That's the AI working detecting what's going on in the agreement. So I've got to put them in that order, though.\nSonak Kolar: Great. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up for Blake. Any context that you can provide in terms of how the macro environment might have trended for Q2 relative to Q1? Were there any signs of improvement in underlying demand trends or maybe pockets of relative stability? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks for the question. I think that from a macro perspective, overall, it seemed pretty similar, I think, from Q1 into Q2. You've got certain verticals and certain areas that show relative strength, and we talked about those on a couple in the prepared remarks. And you have other verticals that are obviously still under some stress. And so we have to deal with that. I think that on the macro side, the biggest pressure point that I think we deal with is how CFOs people in my position are generally scrutinizing investments across the board. And so for us, it's trying to work with them and provide the best value that we can. But nothing I would say, nothing stands out from Q2, I think, from into Q1, but we're still in, obviously, a bit of an uncertain environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you for taking my question and welcome to Blake. I wanted to ask one to Allan. Maybe, Allan, could you talk a little bit about the go-to-market execution? I know you mentioned the focus on product-led growth. But just talk about how it has been with the focus on product-led growth, what has been the approach to attract larger customers? And has it been more challenging? Or is it in line with your expectations?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I'd say, first, we remain primarily dependent on our direct sales channel. That is our primary go-to-market. That will be the case for the foreseeable future. And so the execution that you're seeing in the numbers is a result of that. I'm particularly happy with the customers and renewal management team we delivered, as we mentioned, another quarter of strong on-time renewals. Also, a huge emphasis all throughout the pre-sales, sales and post-sales process on adoption of features that make our products more sticky and more valuable to customers. And as Blake alluded to, we saw nice progress there. As we look ahead, it will be critical to continue that transformation of the sales organization, given the expanding breadth of our product offering and they need to pitch at an even higher level. But I'm very bullish on the progress that our direct team is making. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention I think we made a significant adjustment, as you will recall, in February, with restructuring effort. 95% of that effort was in the field organization. And yet, we, I think, are continuing to be able to execute. So that speaks highly, I think, of the management team's effort there. I'd just add beyond the direct sales execution, as I mentioned, is primary, there are two other points, the digital part, where we are seeing really good progress, and that business is growing a little bit faster, and I'm very pleased with the progress there. And then the third leg of the stool is our partner channel and we are starting to ship features that will enable us to grow that channel so that we can have a really nice omnichannel direct self-serve and partner. Good luck.\nLuv Sodha: Perfect. Yes, just had a quick follow-up for Blake. Just on the net dollar retention, Blake, just -- I know you said it would trend down a little bit further from the 1% or 2%. But any indication as to when we could potentially see some stabilization in that metric?\nBlake Grayson: Yes, sure. So just a reminder and then it's also for me as I'm learning the business. The DNR, the dollar net retention, is only for our direct customers and only for those with a tenure of at least a year. Our kind of communications on this figure is in line with our previous communications regarding the trends. And as covered in the prepared remarks you heard me say we do expect continued pressure into Q3. In a tough macro environment where companies are scrutinizing investments, it can lead to smaller expansion opportunities. And this is really why the product development focus for us and the road map is so important because that's how we can try to provide chances to impact that trend and that's exclusive of macro forecast. So for us to impact that number, that's kind of that longer-term product road map that we can drive to essentially be able to provide customers the chance and opportunity to do more with us to provide them better ROIs and better productivity opportunities. And we've got a lot of initiatives underway to try and make progress there. But with regards to trying to call any time further out beyond Q3, we're not prepared to talk about that at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just get your perspective, Blake, and congrats on the role here. On the international opportunity, you highlighted that as a big opportunity that you saw coming on board. But how are you thinking about the size of that business potentially over time? And any thoughts on potential investments that you can make to better go after that? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. I think from just my history, one of the experiences that I bring and just the perspective is the international business and in a previous role at Amazon, I led finance for the international group there. And the TAM outside of North America is huge and yet it only flex 25%, 26% of our total revenue. So I think the opportunity for us over the long term there, there's no reason why that shouldn't grow as a percent of the total. I think that you've heard Allan talk about the expansion opportunities. We just opened an office in Munich in Germany. And so we are making investments there, and we are seeing those green shoots opportunity. So it's a process for us, right? And when we talk about product development, we talk about product development globally. It's not like a North America only kind of endeavor. And so when we do that and we keep a focus on the global nature of this business, I'm cautiously optimistic that we have an opportunity to really expand our footprint there.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Maybe I can add a little bit more color there. So on the product side, let's take Germany as an example. We launched the ID Verification for EU qualified last quarter. We are qualified for trust provider in the EU. And it puts us in a very unique and strong market position. And the German market is particularly sensitive to those regulatory issues. One of the things we're launching and we previewed it at Momentum Conference is a wallet capability or essentially, once you locked in once with this IT system, you can auto log-in in the future, further reducing the friction added by having more security. And that's been the traditional risk trade-off that companies have faced. So we're, I think, very optimistic about our position in the German market. And as Blake mentioned, we just booked an office there, and I'm going there again next Sunday. In Japan, we're at an even earlier stage of market development. And just at the end of August, we launched a fully localized CLM, which I believe is the first Western-style CLM introduced in Japan, and there's a lot of interest and appetite for that. I was in Tokyo a few weeks ago. We're very bullish on the opportunity in the Japanese market as well. So beyond the markets where we can invest at that level, we will use our self-serve and partner channels to ensure that we're available essentially everywhere where agreements are signed.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thanks for the color and a follow-up question just on underlying growth. And certainly, there was some interesting slides in the presentation. But if I look at four quarter trailing billings quarter, sorry, rolling four-quarter billings growth. It seems like billings growth over the last four quarters has been stabilizing in the low double-digits. You saw subscription growth only decel about one point this quarter. Do you feel like the business is kind of stabilizing here? How should we just think about the normalized growth environment as you kind of process the puts and takes in the quarter? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And I'll take a stab and Allan will jump in, I'm sure if he wants to add any color. So yes, generally, really pleased with how Q2 performed. But like you heard in the prepared remarks, we still have work to do ahead of us. We did double-digit billings and revenue growth year-over-year in Q2. Customers are adopting five or more features -- direct customers are adopting five or more features at an increasing pace year-over-year. Our total customer count grew double-digits year-over-year. International grew well. And we also produced really strong free cash flow for the quarter. We generated $187 million free cash flow of a pretty large foundational base of customers. And obviously, we need to work on retention rates and drive growth, but a decent quarter for us. I think with regard to the future, there are puts and takes every quarter with that billings number. And I appreciate that you're using the four-quarter trailing number. I think that's a good way to look at it. Over Q1 and Q2, we have that strength in on-time renewals, right? And it's forecasted to continue, but there is pressure, as we've previously mentioned, around lower expansion rates and some macro uncertainty. And so that billings number can be a little volatile. I would say that the full year guide that we just announced for billings is actually a bit stronger than it was our last quarter. So for me, as I think about the business and what I'm most focused on is how do we turn the chapter to a new period of growth, we have to be focused on the long-term on continuous product innovation that can drive that future expansion. And that takes some time. But again, this is -- we have a very large kind of core fundamental base book of business, that's the free cash flow generator. But for us, going forward, we're excited to deliver on a product road map that we believe over the long term can deliver growth opportunities.\nAllan Thygesen: I think that's well said, Blake. I would just add. I think this is a transformational year for DocuSign where we're making the investments to enable the next phase of growth. We're happy that we're able to sustain the business nicely. But we're not satisfied with that, and we are planning and executing towards further acceleration in the years to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Has the macro started to impact the top of funnel at all or most of the headwinds still related to just that expansion motion? And then how is linear demand throughout the quarter. Have there been noticeable changes on the macro front, especially as we've gone through July and August?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And I'll take a stab. Let me try to address your last question first. I think on the linearity, it's generally in line with our historical trends. Monthly results can be volatile in this business just due to our sales cycle. What I would say is that the linearity trends, if you will, they're already reflected in our guide. So nothing material to call out from a linearity perspective. I think on the macro component for us, the expansion, I think, is the biggest part. And you -- as I referred to before, we have a very large base of business, over 1.4 million customer accounts. And so that, I think, is on the expansion side is what is probably the more impactful component and you can see that in the DNR rate.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think I spot on that. I would simply add that the relative strength in our digital business, I think, reflects that the SMB segment is doing well. And that is new customer acquisition. I think it reinforces the themes that Blake was talking about.\nJake Roberge: Helpful. And then Allan, you made quite a bit of organizational changes over the past year with two riffs, a new CFO, Head of Sales and President. Do you feel like the structural changes are behind us at this point? And then when do you think those changes start bearing more fruit for DocuSign just as a broader or just given those changes likely take a few quarters, if not years to play out?\nAllan Thygesen: So you're absolutely correct. We've made a substantial effort over the last 15 to 18 months to attract a world-class leadership team that has deep experience, but it's also hungry for the excitement and the challenge of DocuSign's next chapter. I'm really happy with who we've been able to attract. I think it speaks to the opportunity into DocuSign's brand and the quality of the company. The kinds of folks that we've been able to attract not just after I arrived, but also prior. I do think we have a relatively full team now, both directly reporting to me and in fact, in the next couple of layers. I don't have any open positions, the top two layers for me, and that's not been the case for a long time. So I think we're really making good progress also in filling in some of the key leadership roles at the next level. So I feel like the organization is now more ready and poised to fully capitalize on the opportunity ahead of us. In terms of how that plays into that's -- that is the enabler for and the requirement for both the product road map, the GTM transformation and then the growth in the outer years. So we didn't do that first. We couldn't make progress on the other things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much and I wanted to ask a question around the international strength you're seeing. Any countries you'd call out there? And as you've been investing in international, are there any regions that we should expect to see perhaps some incremental traction from here?\nBlake Grayson: I'll just comment. Regionally, I wouldn't say there's necessarily one standout versus the rest. But I just think we had general strength outside of North America, which I actually appreciate because it just goes to the kind of notion about the product and the value offering that we have. And so how do we expand that larger going further. And I think also that as far as like new plans and new regions, we'll take that on a case-by-case basis. I think it's the one nice thing for us, I think, in this business is the marginal cost to expand is not terribly large, right, with us. And so for us, it's opening a sales office and the kind of thing, and you want to have the situation laid out appropriately in order to have the right leadership and scale and things like that. But I don't have anything with that individual countries to reference other than the anecdotes that Allan already provided around Asia and Europe.\nAllan Thygesen: But in general, I'd say I think all the international regions, Europe, APAC, LatAm, all grew double-digits.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. It was strong across the world is what I would say for us. Internationally, we're pleased with our international progress regardless of the region.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. And then just with regard to the restructuring effort and the direct sales organization, do you feel like -- Allan, I think your comments are that you feel like you got the right team in place. But are the efforts to restructure the existing organization? Is that largely in the past, do you feel like you're kind of set up now such that you're kind of in a place where the plan -- the organization in place from here can execute? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: We don't have any plans for any major restructurings of our sales organizations. I mean, obviously, you're always tuning things and I think we're continuing to evolve that, but nothing major and nothing that would -- we could be on the scale or considered like a risk or anything like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe a couple for Blake. Blake, if you don't mind unpacking the 3Q billings guide, it obviously implies down $33 million. I know we had that phenomenon two years ago, but it's typically up sequentially. Is this a function of the greater on-time renewals? Anything else that you might flag around that?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Yes, the guide reflects continued the trends that we're seeing in the on-time renewals. The function of the on-time renewals for us is that every customer situation is different, right? Deals can renew on time, they can be renewed early or they can be pushed out. So every quarter puts and takes on that. The first half of the year has been strong due to sales execution. There are deals that may normally have slipped out to Q3 and they -- that closed in Q2. And so that's a positive. But renewal is, obviously, well, super important for us and really drive that foundational free cash flow generation, it's more of a timing thing than it is for on the growth side. And I think the positive to note for us on the on-time renewals is that we're not relying on discounts or incentives to drive that improvement in that on-time renewals. It's better sales execution. And so the teams were really hard just to stay on top of those things when they come up for renewals because an on-time renewal is just a deal that renews on schedule. And so that's super strong. And with regards to the guide as far as other pressures, that's just the macro pressures we discussed earlier with the DNR like essentially the net retention components and now the pressures that we're seeing there.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Okay. Makes sense. And one more, Blake. Your predecessor, it was never a formal guidance, obviously, around operating cash flow. But the kind of the soft color was that it might land for this fiscal year, a couple of points below operating margins. Is that still roughly your framework as to where cash flow margins might shake out this year?\nBlake Grayson: Yes. I'm not in a place where I want to kind of guide to a specific cash flow margin, so to speak. I think for me, what I'm looking for to the business is a long-term cash generation company that drives profitable sustainable growth. I think that the fact that we've delivered 100 -- I think $211 million of cash flow of operations, $184 million of free cash flow, those were pretty healthy yields. And you'll see those fluctuate in the quarter based on timing and such. But it's a cash generation -- generating business and model that, as a CFO, I'm selfishly super excited about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thank you for the question. I had one more just to clarify on the topic of on-time renewals. So that was part of what drove billings upside this quarter, but now you're saying that the guidance now reflects sort of the same level of on-time renewals. So is that right that there's kind of been a change in how you're incorporating the idea of on-time renewals into guidance? And now if things stay the same in Q3, you wouldn't see upside to billings?\nBlake Grayson: Right. So I'll try to clarify this a bit more, I'm learning this as we go. The thing with on-time renewals is that essentially doing an on-time renewal that maybe in the prior year was pushed out affects your ability to continue that momentum. So it's a timing situation. And so with that strength in the first half, even though you have execution that continues, it's just you kind of run out of room a little bit on it. So it's really more of a timing situation than a growth opportunity. So that's why you see that. And the guidance -- and again, that was in the previously communicated guidance last quarter, and we actually increased the full year guide for this year. So it's all been in there in the guidance, but it's just that nuance of how on time flows through.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Got it. And then one more just on sort of the big picture agreement process and workflows. I was just wondering, are there certain departments or workflows where DocuSign should own that full agreement process versus others where maybe like the basic DocuSign eSignature is integrated into like in HR onboarding or some other departmental or workflow? How to think about the two different possibilities there? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I would say people use DocuSign for all kinds of workflows. But it was going to pick areas where we had a particularly strong early start. From a vertical perspective, obviously, in the finance and real estate area that was very strong. Then, I'd say, moved on to all forms of B2B sales were very enabled by DocuSign, and we see that a lot. And now we're seeing quite a few HR applications, as you alluded to. So we have strong partnerships there with Workday, with SuccessFactors and a lot of deployments in that. And in procurement. Particularly these days, enterprises are very focused on procurement management and automating that process and making it more efficient and more transparent. We see more adoption there as well. So as an example, a lot of our strength in the pharma space comes from procurement use cases. We have a fantastic relationship to pick a different one with NVIDIA, who uses DocuSign both for eSignature and for CLM. And it's really focused on their supply chain efforts. So really, at this point, it's very broad across all the major enterprise workflows and many industries, practically all industries. But we started in different -- we had some industries that were fixed starters for the eSignature movement, if you will. But at this point, it's pretty broad. Does that help?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking our questions, guys. First one on the product set or the feature set. It's much broader and deeper than it was even just a couple of years ago. And I understand, given the macro environment, probably hard to pass or to expect to get all the value you've been putting in the products back from your customers. But I'm curious, how are you making sure that once the macro headwinds subside that you don't put $10 of value into the product and only get $5 back, right, just to make up numbers?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. It's certainly a fair push. What I would say what we've done here over the last nine months or so is really pick up the pace of innovation and product release adding half to our core products. I think the big transformation of DocuSign into this broader agreement platform and the intelligence layer is still ahead of us. We previewed some of that at both the vision and some early releases at Momentum. If you haven't already watched the Momentum keynotes, it's found on our website, it gives a really good overview of where we're heading. So just as an example of things that I think are to come that make this really a more at-scale holistic platform things like orchestration, where we are enabling customers to dynamically assemble workflows related to agreements. Components of every part of the DocuSign every one of our interfaces to third-party ISV applications, I think, is going to be incredibly powerful and re-architecting how agreements get done. That's an example. I think Enterprise Search was something that we will begin to. We will begin to roll out in Q4, and that is being able to do that semantically across your entire agreement base. So to use an example, let's imagine that you're looking for force majeure in your contracts. Today, that would be a large team of lawyers spending months going through all your agreements. We can deliver that and have the AI dynamically interpret all the symptoms and ways in which that might be expressed and give you all the agreements that are relevant to that query. That's really transformational capability that we do not provide today. So I just want to say that, to-date, many of these releases have been complementary to our -- to the products that we've been shipping for a while. And they're great. And I think we're -- it's giving us even more of a market leadership position. But the broader repositioning of DocuSign as the enabler of creator of this agreement workflow and agreement intelligence model is still to come. And we will begin, I think, delivering against that later this year and then all throughout next year. And so I think we have so much runway ahead of us from a product perspective.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Great. And then a quick follow-up. Blake, what should like what's the plan or what should we expect for stock-based comp? I'm surprised to see it up year-over-year just given the trend in headcount?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So stock-based comp as a percentage of revenue in Q2 is about 22%. And that's held relatively steady for us. We review that number with our outside compensation, consultants were slightly higher than our average peer group. The driver on the year-over-year increase has a lot to do with the new leadership folks that we've brought on to the team. And so you'll see -- me being one of those people, and you'll see that. And so it is something we're definitely paying attention to and mindful of, but that's the gap when you're asking about between headcount and cost. And so that will take time, obviously, but we'll work through that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a solid quarter. I guess, two for me. The first one, I want to go back to the question around net retention because, I think, it's really, really important. To some extent, how much of the net retention dynamic is under your control, meaning how much of it is a macro pressure versus competition and consolidation or repair loss effectively? And I ask that because to some extent, your -- you've already released a number of really interesting new products in market, CLM+, CLM, the Identity product that you talked about. So is there any way to kind of just give us some confidence around like what level to the question earlier, it shouldn't dip below or like when -- how many quarters after the cohorts that you're comping kind of normalize that we should start seeing it at least be stable?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. It's awfully challenging for me to try to look into that crystal ball and tell you on the cohort side. What I would say is I think you've nailed it in your question that it's a combination, right? We have a combination of macro kind of effects that essentially as customers scrutinize their investments and they're trying to save every dollar they can what do they do. But then it's also combined with that, we have it under our control that if we can execute and provide products that customers want and over time we expand, it gives us that opportunity for expansion. So I think it's a double kind of a component that affects that rate. And so it's -- part of its under our control and part of it's also is the macro environment. But at the end of the day, I feel like if we can execute on that product road map over time, it kind of destinies in our hands. Allan will probably maybe add more to that.\nAllan Thygesen: No, I agree. I set with that. And look, we've said that it was going to be a few quarters of downward trend, and then we will see how we do with the product release system, but we certainly want to get it to a healthier level. And it's our expectation that we'll be able to do that. So that's much as we can say at this point.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess the other question is, again, it feels like a bit of a tale of kind of two cities, right? To some extent, you've got the double-digit growth, both in billings and in CRPO and subscription revenue. But then to the question Karl asked, like your guidance implies billings in the very low single-digit range in the second half. It implies that even subscription revenue growth kind of goes down into the 6% range exiting the year. And I appreciate the conservatism we do love it. But if you think about the business itself and that's why that NRR question comes back. The Street has you accelerating in Q1, right, and to some extent, accelerating next year. So just help us level set like that exit rate that you're looking at for Q4, what would be the factors that you would be expecting to kind of have to see for it to kind of get better from there?\nBlake Grayson: Right. So again, I mean, our full year guide is in line or better than it was in the previous quarter. So we're staying in line or better in that guidance. I think that like we've talked about and referenced a couple of times on the call that the strength in the on-time renewals is what has driven that outperformance in the first half of the year. And so -- and then the pressure like you noted on DNR expansion rates and macro uncertain, it creates volatility for us. And frankly, over the long term, and I'm not putting a time line on that, but it's how do we reaccelerate growth and particularly around the product innovation that we have in front of us. And so as a company, I would tell you that 70-plus percent of our time as a leadership team is on how do we evolve this product road map in a way that customers like appreciate and provides us the opportunities for expansion. And so that's what we're solely focused on. We believe that if we can deliver on that road map, the results will show themselves.\nAllan Thygesen: I agree with that. And I would just say, in my mind, the best thing that happened this quarter, yes, I'm proud of the solid execution, kudos to the team. But the fact that we were able to present our vision and road map to customers and partners, and that they validated -- enthusiastically validated that everywhere I went. I was incredibly gratifying and tells us I think we're on the right path. So I think we're very bullish on the long-term future for DocuSign. And I think that bullishness just became more pronounced as a result of the sharing of the road map and the feedback that we got. So that is our goal is to deliver against that. And I think if we do that, all will be very -- all will be well.\nAllan Thygesen: Maybe to close. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're pleased with the results and feedback and we're driving transformation here at DocuSign. We want to balance our product investments with operational efficiency and drive shareholder value. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thanks, Allan, for the kind words, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to join my first earnings call as DocuSign's CFO. Over the last few months, I've gained considerable exposure into the workings of our business and value proposition as we look to transform agreement workflows. First, I'd like to share what led me to join DocuSign. DocuSign has a powerful brand and a scale in our customer base that is rare in the enterprise software space. We deliver high ROI products that enable our customers to complete agreements faster, easier and more securely. The opportunity for our business is quite large. And while I am optimistic about our future, we still have work to do to achieve our goals, particularly in a demand environment where companies are appropriately scrutinizing their investments. With that, let me turn to our Q2 results. For the second quarter, total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $688 million, and subscription revenue also grew 11% year-over-year to $669 million. Our international revenue growth outpaced our domestic business with 17% year-over-year growth to reach $180 million in the second quarter, representing 26% of our total revenue. When I think about the market opportunity ahead, I'm excited by the greenfield space that exists internationally. It is a largely untapped market and a key pillar of future growth. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we work to increase our footprint globally. Second quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $711 million. Similar to last quarter, our Q2 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. It is encouraging to see us maintain the higher level of sales execution we saw in Q1 through the first half of the year. However, given the macro environment and headwinds and some expansion metrics, we continue to expect billings growth deceleration in the back half of the year, which is in line with our previously communicated expectations. We added approximately 37,000 new customers during the quarter, which brings our total customer base to 1.44 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 6,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 226,000, an 18% year-over-year increase. We also saw a 6% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value exceeding $300,000 with a total of 1,047 customers. Similar to last quarter, the quarter-on-quarter decline in this customer segment was primarily related to customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. However, as we ship innovative features to deepen our product line-up and differentiate our offerings, more customers are recognizing the value of adopting our features and frictionless functionality. This increases product stickiness and we are pleased that over 50% of our direct customers have now adopted five or more features, an increase of nearly 10 points year-over-year. Dollar net retention was 102% for the quarter. We're seeing continued macro pressures resulting in moderated expansion rates. And as we expect customers to continue scrutinizing budgets and optimizing spend, we anticipate the Q3 dollar net retention rate to trend downward. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within health care, insurance and business services. One of the most significant strengths I've gained insight into is DocuSign's broad and diverse customer base, which enables us to help offset pressures from verticals that are more sensitive to the interest rate environment, such as real estate. Given the large breadth and depth of our installed base and the investments we're making in product innovation, we believe that as the macro environment stabilizes or improves, DocuSign will be well positioned to capture expansion opportunities. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 82%, in line with the prior year. Second quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with the prior year. Q2 non-GAAP operating income reached $170 million, up 51% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% was up nearly 700 basis points compared to 18% last year. As discussed on last quarter's call, we are executing against our investment plan. Our philosophy on vesting is consistent. We'll maintain continued disciplined investments to drive growth in our top line over time. Although we expect to ramp investment in the back half of this year, we still expect to exit the year with operating margins better than they were prior to our restructuring efforts. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72, an improvement of $0.28 from last year of $0.44. We ended Q2 with 6,748 employees compared to 8,061 the year prior. Second quarter operating cash flow was $211 million, representing a 31% margin and an increase of 75% versus the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was also up 74% year-over-year coming in at $184 million, representing a 27% margin. As I'm learning more about the business, I am impressed with our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. With regards to the balance sheet, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We currently have approximately $725 million in convertible debt that will be maturing over the next few months. Our strong cash position is a reflection of the operating leverage in our business model that provides a strong level of flexibility. And as we think about utilizing this cash, we will do so thoughtfully ensuring our capital is strategically deployed. Related to this, we redeployed excess capital during the quarter and repurchased 583,000 shares for approximately $30 million. We also announced today that we are increasing the size of our share repurchase program to $500 million, up from $200 million as we continue to focus on being opportunistic, reducing dilution and returning excess capital to shareholders as appropriate. In addition to our share repurchase program, during the quarter, we used $40 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact of our equity programs. With that, let me turn to our Q3 and fiscal '24 guidance. To reiterate, while we're pleased with our Q2 financial results, we're also cautious in light of an uncertain macro environment and competitive dynamics. For the third quarter and fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $687 million to $691 million in Q3 or a 6% to 7% year-over-year increase and $2.725 billion to $2.737 billion for fiscal '24 or an 8% to 9% year-over-year increase. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $669 million to $673 million in Q3 or a 7% to 8% year-over-year increase and $2.649 billion to $2.661 billion for fiscal '24 or an 8% to 9% year-over-year increase. For billings, we expect $668 million to $678 million in Q3 or a 1% to 3% growth rate year-over-year and $2.804 billion to $2.824 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 5% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q3 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 22% to 23% for Q3 and 23% to 24% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q3 and fiscal '24. In closing, I want to thank our team for their warm welcome and their commitment to work with our customers in a challenging environment and I look forward to connecting with many of you in the near future. We are focused on executing against the key initiatives that we believe will drive future long-term growth and expansion as well as being mindful of efficiency opportunities that will set us up for profitable, sustainable growth. As Allan mentioned, we are the only company at scale that is solely focused on helping customers improve the agreement process. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we continue to evolve the agreement workflow category and help our customers become more productive and more efficient. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Sure. Thanks for the question. I think that from a macro perspective, overall, it seemed pretty similar, I think, from Q1 into Q2. You've got certain verticals and certain areas that show relative strength, and we talked about those on a couple in the prepared remarks. And you have other verticals that are obviously still under some stress. And so we have to deal with that. I think that on the macro side, the biggest pressure point that I think we deal with is how CFOs people in my position are generally scrutinizing investments across the board. And so for us, it's trying to work with them and provide the best value that we can. But nothing I would say, nothing stands out from Q2, I think, from into Q1, but we're still in, obviously, a bit of an uncertain environment. Yes, sure. So just a reminder and then it's also for me as I'm learning the business. The DNR, the dollar net retention, is only for our direct customers and only for those with a tenure of at least a year. Our kind of communications on this figure is in line with our previous communications regarding the trends. And as covered in the prepared remarks you heard me say we do expect continued pressure into Q3. In a tough macro environment where companies are scrutinizing investments, it can lead to smaller expansion opportunities. And this is really why the product development focus for us and the road map is so important because that's how we can try to provide chances to impact that trend and that's exclusive of macro forecast. So for us to impact that number, that's kind of that longer-term product road map that we can drive to essentially be able to provide customers the chance and opportunity to do more with us to provide them better ROIs and better productivity opportunities. And we've got a lot of initiatives underway to try and make progress there. But with regards to trying to call any time further out beyond Q3, we're not prepared to talk about that at this time. Sure. I think from just my history, one of the experiences that I bring and just the perspective is the international business and in a previous role at Amazon, I led finance for the international group there. And the TAM outside of North America is huge and yet it only flex 25%, 26% of our total revenue. So I think the opportunity for us over the long term there, there's no reason why that shouldn't grow as a percent of the total. I think that you've heard Allan talk about the expansion opportunities. We just opened an office in Munich in Germany. And so we are making investments there, and we are seeing those green shoots opportunity. So it's a process for us, right? And when we talk about product development, we talk about product development globally. It's not like a North America only kind of endeavor. And so when we do that and we keep a focus on the global nature of this business, I'm cautiously optimistic that we have an opportunity to really expand our footprint there. Sure. And I'll take a stab and Allan will jump in, I'm sure if he wants to add any color. So yes, generally, really pleased with how Q2 performed. But like you heard in the prepared remarks, we still have work to do ahead of us. We did double-digit billings and revenue growth year-over-year in Q2. Customers are adopting five or more features -- direct customers are adopting five or more features at an increasing pace year-over-year. Our total customer count grew double-digits year-over-year. International grew well. And we also produced really strong free cash flow for the quarter. We generated $187 million free cash flow of a pretty large foundational base of customers. And obviously, we need to work on retention rates and drive growth, but a decent quarter for us. I think with regard to the future, there are puts and takes every quarter with that billings number. And I appreciate that you're using the four-quarter trailing number. I think that's a good way to look at it. Over Q1 and Q2, we have that strength in on-time renewals, right? And it's forecasted to continue, but there is pressure, as we've previously mentioned, around lower expansion rates and some macro uncertainty. And so that billings number can be a little volatile. I would say that the full year guide that we just announced for billings is actually a bit stronger than it was our last quarter. So for me, as I think about the business and what I'm most focused on is how do we turn the chapter to a new period of growth, we have to be focused on the long-term on continuous product innovation that can drive that future expansion. And that takes some time. But again, this is -- we have a very large kind of core fundamental base book of business, that's the free cash flow generator. But for us, going forward, we're excited to deliver on a product road map that we believe over the long term can deliver growth opportunities. Sure. And I'll take a stab. Let me try to address your last question first. I think on the linearity, it's generally in line with our historical trends. Monthly results can be volatile in this business just due to our sales cycle. What I would say is that the linearity trends, if you will, they're already reflected in our guide. So nothing material to call out from a linearity perspective. I think on the macro component for us, the expansion, I think, is the biggest part. And you -- as I referred to before, we have a very large base of business, over 1.4 million customer accounts. And so that, I think, is on the expansion side is what is probably the more impactful component and you can see that in the DNR rate. I'll just comment. Regionally, I wouldn't say there's necessarily one standout versus the rest. But I just think we had general strength outside of North America, which I actually appreciate because it just goes to the kind of notion about the product and the value offering that we have. And so how do we expand that larger going further. And I think also that as far as like new plans and new regions, we'll take that on a case-by-case basis. I think it's the one nice thing for us, I think, in this business is the marginal cost to expand is not terribly large, right, with us. And so for us, it's opening a sales office and the kind of thing, and you want to have the situation laid out appropriately in order to have the right leadership and scale and things like that. But I don't have anything with that individual countries to reference other than the anecdotes that Allan already provided around Asia and Europe. Yes. It was strong across the world is what I would say for us. Internationally, we're pleased with our international progress regardless of the region. Sure. Yes, the guide reflects continued the trends that we're seeing in the on-time renewals. The function of the on-time renewals for us is that every customer situation is different, right? Deals can renew on time, they can be renewed early or they can be pushed out. So every quarter puts and takes on that. The first half of the year has been strong due to sales execution. There are deals that may normally have slipped out to Q3 and they -- that closed in Q2. And so that's a positive. But renewal is, obviously, well, super important for us and really drive that foundational free cash flow generation, it's more of a timing thing than it is for on the growth side. And I think the positive to note for us on the on-time renewals is that we're not relying on discounts or incentives to drive that improvement in that on-time renewals. It's better sales execution. And so the teams were really hard just to stay on top of those things when they come up for renewals because an on-time renewal is just a deal that renews on schedule. And so that's super strong. And with regards to the guide as far as other pressures, that's just the macro pressures we discussed earlier with the DNR like essentially the net retention components and now the pressures that we're seeing there. Yes. I'm not in a place where I want to kind of guide to a specific cash flow margin, so to speak. I think for me, what I'm looking for to the business is a long-term cash generation company that drives profitable sustainable growth. I think that the fact that we've delivered 100 -- I think $211 million of cash flow of operations, $184 million of free cash flow, those were pretty healthy yields. And you'll see those fluctuate in the quarter based on timing and such. But it's a cash generation -- generating business and model that, as a CFO, I'm selfishly super excited about. Right. So I'll try to clarify this a bit more, I'm learning this as we go. The thing with on-time renewals is that essentially doing an on-time renewal that maybe in the prior year was pushed out affects your ability to continue that momentum. So it's a timing situation. And so with that strength in the first half, even though you have execution that continues, it's just you kind of run out of room a little bit on it. So it's really more of a timing situation than a growth opportunity. So that's why you see that. And the guidance -- and again, that was in the previously communicated guidance last quarter, and we actually increased the full year guide for this year. So it's all been in there in the guidance, but it's just that nuance of how on time flows through. Sure. So stock-based comp as a percentage of revenue in Q2 is about 22%. And that's held relatively steady for us. We review that number with our outside compensation, consultants were slightly higher than our average peer group. The driver on the year-over-year increase has a lot to do with the new leadership folks that we've brought on to the team. And so you'll see -- me being one of those people, and you'll see that. And so it is something we're definitely paying attention to and mindful of, but that's the gap when you're asking about between headcount and cost. And so that will take time, obviously, but we'll work through that. Sure. It's awfully challenging for me to try to look into that crystal ball and tell you on the cohort side. What I would say is I think you've nailed it in your question that it's a combination, right? We have a combination of macro kind of effects that essentially as customers scrutinize their investments and they're trying to save every dollar they can what do they do. But then it's also combined with that, we have it under our control that if we can execute and provide products that customers want and over time we expand, it gives us that opportunity for expansion. So I think it's a double kind of a component that affects that rate. And so it's -- part of its under our control and part of it's also is the macro environment. But at the end of the day, I feel like if we can execute on that product road map over time, it kind of destinies in our hands. Allan will probably maybe add more to that. Right. So again, I mean, our full year guide is in line or better than it was in the previous quarter. So we're staying in line or better in that guidance. I think that like we've talked about and referenced a couple of times on the call that the strength in the on-time renewals is what has driven that outperformance in the first half of the year. And so -- and then the pressure like you noted on DNR expansion rates and macro uncertain, it creates volatility for us. And frankly, over the long term, and I'm not putting a time line on that, but it's how do we reaccelerate growth and particularly around the product innovation that we have in front of us. And so as a company, I would tell you that 70-plus percent of our time as a leadership team is on how do we evolve this product road map in a way that customers like appreciate and provides us the opportunities for expansion. And so that's what we're solely focused on. We believe that if we can deliver on that road map, the results will show themselves."

            "name": "Allan Thygesen",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed out the first half of the year strong by delivering solid second quarter financial results. We continue to drive momentum in our business by making progress against our key initiatives and delivering enhancements to our product portfolio. Exiting the quarter, I feel energized, having recently come off our momentum events where we visited eight cities spanning five continents. We met with thousands of partners and customers who are excited to hear about our dual track plans to improve agreement workflows. In the near-term, we're focused on the agreement management layer. We're taking something that's quite complex for our customers and making it easier and more delightful. And over-time, we're building the intelligence layer that will unlock agreement data. We presented our future vision, publicly shared our product roadmap and received tremendous validation after showcasing product demonstrations aligned to these two priorities over the quarter. Let me share some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q2 total revenue came in at $688 million, up 11% versus prior year and Q2 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 25%. While we are pleased with our results, like many others, we are seeing continued macro pressures tempering expansion rates. However, we remain focused on what we can control, executing against our initiatives to drive innovation and operational efficiency, further setting the foundation for growth while navigating an uncertain environment. Now I want to highlight our pace of innovation driven by our delivery of new features and products. The progress we're making demonstrates how we are expanding upon our leadership in eSignature. As I said, we're thinking about our roadmap on two horizons. In the short-term, we're looking to ship new features and functionality that differentiate DocuSign and streamline agreement workflows, bringing in new customers and continuing to deliver value to existing customers. To that end, we continue to expand our identity verification portfolio announcing the global launch of Liveness Detection for ID Verification. Liveness Detection technology leverages AI-powered biometric checks to prevent identity spoofing which results in more accurate verification without the signee being present. ID Verification is already helping our customers. Our data shows that it has reduced time to sign by about 60%. Later this year, we expect to expand our functionality with a wallet feature that will enable frequent users to save their profile, driving improved efficiency and convenience. These add-ons will be available for all of our plans, including our standard plan representing an important differentiator for DocuSign's product offering for all customer types. As I've stated in the past, the value of an agreement is in the data and every step of the workflow will benefit when it's automated, intelligent and seamlessly integrated into core businesses. Web Forms is delivering on that vision. During the quarter, we shipped and announced more and increasingly sophisticated capabilities to our Web Forms offering. In July, Web Forms became available on DocuSign FedRAMP moderate environment, which unlocks new possibilities for our federal state and local government customers to digitize their forms. We also soon ship advanced reporting capabilities, enabling users to unlock data from their agreements to uncover actionable insights and drive data-driven decisions. This quarter we also announced that DocuSign Monitor is now available to our CLM customers. Monitor provides a comprehensive and holistic multiproduct view of user activity on one dashboard for both CLM and eSignature ensuring organizations can quickly and easily detect, investigate and respond to suspicious activity before incidents occur. For our customers, it's powerful reassurance. Losing even one high-value agreement can have a significant business impact. We are seeing large marquee organizations across industries, including tech and finance, like DocuSign CLM to transform how they automate their end-to-end agreement processes across their entire enterprise. As an example, we closed one of our largest CLM deals ever. This customer is a leading residential solar company turn to our CLM solutions to help automate over 1,200 of their agreement templates, leveraging our document generation and workflow management capabilities. CLM helps them automate their agreement process across teams, adding simplicity and security. Our CLM today represents a small contribution to our overall business. We saw solid year-on-year growth, which is a reflection of our leading market position. We are encouraged by the wins and we have just begun to tap into the potential for this market. More broadly, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our vision of smart agreements. Before we discuss our final update, it's worth grounding this portion with a reminder of what's generally true in the market. Individual solutions work but customers suffer when putting together solutions combining different product categories like CLM, eSignature, workflow management, document storage and so on. Today only the largest enterprises with resources and IT sophistication can link these solutions together and only a significant expense. This depresses the overall consumption and size of market. We are on a multi-quarter path to evolve our offerings towards a platform capable of coordinating broader processes at a fraction of current complexity. Our goal is to unlock the market for intelligent agreement management from millions of businesses, automating billions of hours of manual work and improving business outcomes. Today, we are already monetizing AI directly through our CLM plus products and indirectly through its use in our products such as search. Our next step on that journey is with AI labs. With AI labs, we are co-innovating with our customers. We provide a sandbox where customers can share a select subset of agreements find new features we're testing. Our customers get early access to developing technology and we receive early feedback that we will incorporate into our products. By working with our customers in the development phase, we're further reinforcing the trusted position we've earned over the last 20 years. Next, let me provide an update on the progress we're making with our go-to-market capabilities, balancing scale with efficiency. As we evolve how DocuSign goes to market, integrating our digital direct and partner selling motions to leverage an omnichannel approach. I'd like to provide an update on the progress we're making in our self-serve product like growth channel. The PLG and self-serve capabilities are one of our most important areas of investment. In addition to our continued focus on delivering against our product road map, we're improving our customer experience by making DocuSign products much easier to try and buy. With such a diversified customer base, it's critical that we deliver delightful self-service experiences, not just for growth, but also for scale and efficiency. We made good traction over the quarter, noting higher traffic conversion rates of new customers on our website. We've also unlocked expansion opportunities for customers directly within their product experience, resulting in relative strength through our digital channel. We expanded relationships with our partner ecosystem, which is an important part of our omnichannel approach to drive reach and scale. In Q2, we launched pay-as-you-go offering for our ISV partners, enables ISVs to embed DocuSign eSignature in their agreement workflows on a consumption basis. Over the course of the next few months, we will have been featured partners in some of the most important technical conferences, most notably at Google Next, Dreamforce, Deutsche Telekom's Digital X and Microsoft Ignite. One of the key pillars of our omnichannel is strengthening our direct sales productivity. This was the second consecutive quarter of a higher-than-anticipated rate of on-time renewals, which is a positive sign of increasing go-to-market execution. It's contributed favorably to our billings outperformance for the quarter, which Blake will touch on in the financial update. In our international business, expansion remains the largest part of our addressable market, and we are making progress. This past quarter, one of Australia's largest banks expanded their relationship with us. Customers since 2020, they use our solutions to streamline both internal and customer-facing business processes in an effort to remove friction, reduce cost and deliver better experiences. The upside potential in our international business is large. And as I had commented on previously, we met with hundreds of our international customers through DocuSign's Momentum Events. The excitement about our product road map was contagious, and we look forward to growing our presence globally. We are shaping the future of the agreement category and building on our global scale and trusted market position. The future of agreements is not about attaching yourself to a legacy document format. As we continue our product evolution by adding intelligence and unlocking the data trapped in agreements, we're increasing productivity, reducing friction and saving our customers' time. This is a fundamental shift in the agreement space. I'm confident in our competitive advantage as DocuSign is the largest player, focused solely on improving the agreement process. Moreover, there's no other company focused on the full end-to-end agreement process for companies of every size from SMBs up to the world's largest enterprises. In closing, I want to thank DocuSign's employees worldwide for their collective power in driving our success. I'm proud of the tremendous job the team has done navigating the dynamic environment. I'd now like to welcome Blake Grayson, who, as you know, joined us in mid-June as our CFO. Blake has proven to be a valuable addition to our team, and I look forward to our continued partnership. Let me turn it over to Blake to review our financial performance. Yes. Look, I think we think AI will impact practically all of our products at every step with the agreement workflow. So I don't know that there's a -- just a one call out. But maybe to rattle off a couple that I'm most interested in. I certainly think that the broader, should we say, agreement analytics category is poised to be completely revamped with Generative AI. We were an early investor in that category. We saw that coming together with CLM four or five years ago and made a couple of strategic investments and been a leader in that space, but have been held back by fundamental technology. And I think now with Generative AI, we can do a substantially better job more seamlessly, lighter weight with less professional services. And so I'm very excited to think about how it transformed the CLM category and enables us to deliver more intelligent agreements. I think you mentioned IDV. I agree 100%. Fundamentally, that entire category is AI-enabled. The upload and ingestion of your ID recognition of it and then that Liveness Detection where we're detecting who you are and that you are present and matching that to ID, that would simply not be possible without today's AI technology and really takes just dramatically reshapes the ability to trade off risk and convenience. So I think that's a good one. And but I really do think that it works across the entire flow. We use it today. And when you use DocuSign eSignature today, we automatically recognize your field. That's the AI working detecting what's going on in the agreement. So I've got to put them in that order, though. Yes. I'd say, first, we remain primarily dependent on our direct sales channel. That is our primary go-to-market. That will be the case for the foreseeable future. And so the execution that you're seeing in the numbers is a result of that. I'm particularly happy with the customers and renewal management team we delivered, as we mentioned, another quarter of strong on-time renewals. Also, a huge emphasis all throughout the pre-sales, sales and post-sales process on adoption of features that make our products more sticky and more valuable to customers. And as Blake alluded to, we saw nice progress there. As we look ahead, it will be critical to continue that transformation of the sales organization, given the expanding breadth of our product offering and they need to pitch at an even higher level. But I'm very bullish on the progress that our direct team is making. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention I think we made a significant adjustment, as you will recall, in February, with restructuring effort. 95% of that effort was in the field organization. And yet, we, I think, are continuing to be able to execute. So that speaks highly, I think, of the management team's effort there. I'd just add beyond the direct sales execution, as I mentioned, is primary, there are two other points, the digital part, where we are seeing really good progress, and that business is growing a little bit faster, and I'm very pleased with the progress there. And then the third leg of the stool is our partner channel and we are starting to ship features that will enable us to grow that channel so that we can have a really nice omnichannel direct self-serve and partner. Good luck. Yes. Maybe I can add a little bit more color there. So on the product side, let's take Germany as an example. We launched the ID Verification for EU qualified last quarter. We are qualified for trust provider in the EU. And it puts us in a very unique and strong market position. And the German market is particularly sensitive to those regulatory issues. One of the things we're launching and we previewed it at Momentum Conference is a wallet capability or essentially, once you locked in once with this IT system, you can auto log-in in the future, further reducing the friction added by having more security. And that's been the traditional risk trade-off that companies have faced. So we're, I think, very optimistic about our position in the German market. And as Blake mentioned, we just booked an office there, and I'm going there again next Sunday. In Japan, we're at an even earlier stage of market development. And just at the end of August, we launched a fully localized CLM, which I believe is the first Western-style CLM introduced in Japan, and there's a lot of interest and appetite for that. I was in Tokyo a few weeks ago. We're very bullish on the opportunity in the Japanese market as well. So beyond the markets where we can invest at that level, we will use our self-serve and partner channels to ensure that we're available essentially everywhere where agreements are signed. I think that's well said, Blake. I would just add. I think this is a transformational year for DocuSign where we're making the investments to enable the next phase of growth. We're happy that we're able to sustain the business nicely. But we're not satisfied with that, and we are planning and executing towards further acceleration in the years to come. Yes. I think I spot on that. I would simply add that the relative strength in our digital business, I think, reflects that the SMB segment is doing well. And that is new customer acquisition. I think it reinforces the themes that Blake was talking about. So you're absolutely correct. We've made a substantial effort over the last 15 to 18 months to attract a world-class leadership team that has deep experience, but it's also hungry for the excitement and the challenge of DocuSign's next chapter. I'm really happy with who we've been able to attract. I think it speaks to the opportunity into DocuSign's brand and the quality of the company. The kinds of folks that we've been able to attract not just after I arrived, but also prior. I do think we have a relatively full team now, both directly reporting to me and in fact, in the next couple of layers. I don't have any open positions, the top two layers for me, and that's not been the case for a long time. So I think we're really making good progress also in filling in some of the key leadership roles at the next level. So I feel like the organization is now more ready and poised to fully capitalize on the opportunity ahead of us. In terms of how that plays into that's -- that is the enabler for and the requirement for both the product road map, the GTM transformation and then the growth in the outer years. So we didn't do that first. We couldn't make progress on the other things. But in general, I'd say I think all the international regions, Europe, APAC, LatAm, all grew double-digits. Yes. We don't have any plans for any major restructurings of our sales organizations. I mean, obviously, you're always tuning things and I think we're continuing to evolve that, but nothing major and nothing that would -- we could be on the scale or considered like a risk or anything like that. Yes. I would say people use DocuSign for all kinds of workflows. But it was going to pick areas where we had a particularly strong early start. From a vertical perspective, obviously, in the finance and real estate area that was very strong. Then, I'd say, moved on to all forms of B2B sales were very enabled by DocuSign, and we see that a lot. And now we're seeing quite a few HR applications, as you alluded to. So we have strong partnerships there with Workday, with SuccessFactors and a lot of deployments in that. And in procurement. Particularly these days, enterprises are very focused on procurement management and automating that process and making it more efficient and more transparent. We see more adoption there as well. So as an example, a lot of our strength in the pharma space comes from procurement use cases. We have a fantastic relationship to pick a different one with NVIDIA, who uses DocuSign both for eSignature and for CLM. And it's really focused on their supply chain efforts. So really, at this point, it's very broad across all the major enterprise workflows and many industries, practically all industries. But we started in different -- we had some industries that were fixed starters for the eSignature movement, if you will. But at this point, it's pretty broad. Does that help? Yes. It's certainly a fair push. What I would say what we've done here over the last nine months or so is really pick up the pace of innovation and product release adding half to our core products. I think the big transformation of DocuSign into this broader agreement platform and the intelligence layer is still ahead of us. We previewed some of that at both the vision and some early releases at Momentum. If you haven't already watched the Momentum keynotes, it's found on our website, it gives a really good overview of where we're heading. So just as an example of things that I think are to come that make this really a more at-scale holistic platform things like orchestration, where we are enabling customers to dynamically assemble workflows related to agreements. Components of every part of the DocuSign every one of our interfaces to third-party ISV applications, I think, is going to be incredibly powerful and re-architecting how agreements get done. That's an example. I think Enterprise Search was something that we will begin to. We will begin to roll out in Q4, and that is being able to do that semantically across your entire agreement base. So to use an example, let's imagine that you're looking for force majeure in your contracts. Today, that would be a large team of lawyers spending months going through all your agreements. We can deliver that and have the AI dynamically interpret all the symptoms and ways in which that might be expressed and give you all the agreements that are relevant to that query. That's really transformational capability that we do not provide today. So I just want to say that, to-date, many of these releases have been complementary to our -- to the products that we've been shipping for a while. And they're great. And I think we're -- it's giving us even more of a market leadership position. But the broader repositioning of DocuSign as the enabler of creator of this agreement workflow and agreement intelligence model is still to come. And we will begin, I think, delivering against that later this year and then all throughout next year. And so I think we have so much runway ahead of us from a product perspective. No, I agree. I set with that. And look, we've said that it was going to be a few quarters of downward trend, and then we will see how we do with the product release system, but we certainly want to get it to a healthier level. And it's our expectation that we'll be able to do that. So that's much as we can say at this point. I agree with that. And I would just say, in my mind, the best thing that happened this quarter, yes, I'm proud of the solid execution, kudos to the team. But the fact that we were able to present our vision and road map to customers and partners, and that they validated -- enthusiastically validated that everywhere I went. I was incredibly gratifying and tells us I think we're on the right path. So I think we're very bullish on the long-term future for DocuSign. And I think that bullishness just became more pronounced as a result of the sharing of the road map and the feedback that we got. So that is our goal is to deliver against that. And I think if we do that, all will be very -- all will be well. Maybe to close. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're pleased with the results and feedback and we're driving transformation here at DocuSign. We want to balance our product investments with operational efficiency and drive shareholder value. Thank you for joining us."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered a solid start to the fiscal year, reporting financial metrics that exceeded our guidance. We announced new product innovations to enable smarter, easier, trusted agreement workflows. First, some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q1 total revenue came in at $661 million, up 12% versus prior year. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin came in at a healthy 27%, driven by our continued focus on profitability and efficiency. We're pleased with the early traction we're making against our objectives. However, we do continue to operate in a challenging macro environment with cautious customer sentiment, evident in moderating expansion rates. Last quarter, I shared our plans to accelerate our product release cycles in fiscal 2024. What you'll see is that our roadmap builds on DocuSign's strength as the world's leading e-signature company while also moving us towards enabling the entire agreement journey with intelligent workflows. We're deepening these capabilities to deliver more strategic value to our customers. With that, let me touch on three new releases that shipped this quarter. First, as mentioned on the Q4 call, DocuSign Web Forms launched in April. In the first few weeks since launch, we're seeing strong traction for Web Forms across verticals, including financial services, real estate, healthcare and life sciences, leveraging our differentiated approach to streamlining how agreements are generated. Web Forms are simple and powerful for both senders and signers. They're easy to use and customers benefit from the ability to more easily capture and leverage data from their agreements. Next, we made strong progress penetrating and innovating in highly regulated markets. One example is our work in the healthcare vertical, which is undergoing dramatic digital transformation. We're proud that our e-signature product can now seamlessly connect to electronic health records in the U.S. market, including from Epic and Cerner in accordance with industry standards. This will modernize the patient experience and improve efficiency for healthcare companies, while also deepening DocuSign's presence within the vertical. And finally, we introduced DocuSign ID Verification Premier, our tier of ID solutions which meet the highest levels of trust, security and compliance. Our first offering within this tier is ID verification for EU Qualified e-signature. By combining verification of an ID with confirmation of the presence of the person on the ID, it fully replaces face-to-face verifications and a handwritten signature under EU law. We look forward to leveraging this powerful offering as we expand our business in Europe. More broadly, our strategy is to partner closely with leading identity services companies to leverage -- to integrate the best breed solutions into our platform. Looking ahead, I'd like to share our vision and thinking on generative AI. In brief, we believe AI unlocks the true potential of the intelligent agreement category. We already have a strong track record, leveraging sophisticated AI models, having built and shipped solutions based on earlier generations of AI. Generative AI can transform all aspects of agreement workflow, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. As an early example, we recently introduced a new limited availability feature Agreement Summarization. This new feature, which is enabled by our integration with Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and tuned with our own proprietary agreement model, uses AI to summarize and documents critical components, giving signers a clear grasp of the most relevant information within their agreement while respecting data security and privacy. Future launches will include search across customer agreement libraries, extractions from agreements and proposed language and edits based on customer, industry and universal best practices. DocuSign is a trusted partner to leading companies across many industries. As the leader in agreement workflows, we can use AI to deliver important value to customers by leveraging the world's largest set of agreement data, our proprietary agreement models and deep integrations with best-in-class third-party models. We're excited to showcase new products and enhancements at our -- on our intelligent agreement roadmap, including significant AI-powered innovations at our user conference Momentum. The event will kick off next week in Santa Clara with virtual and in-person events in eight cities around the globe over the next few months. Turning to our initiatives around our omnichannel go-to-market. We are continuing to drive deep relationships within our partner ecosystem and enhancing our AI capabilities. We were honored to be showcased in the main keynote of Microsoft's Build Conference as one of the first companies using Microsoft Azure OpenAI. This further underscores our growing relationship with Microsoft and the opportunities we're seeing to enhance our AI capabilities. During the quarter, we also joined the SAP Endorsed Apps program. E-signature has been rigorously tested and validated by SAP to ensure that it seamlessly integrates with SAP solutions and meets their high standards for quality and performance. We're pleased with the progress we're seeing across our partner ecosystem, which will continue to drive further adoption of our products globally. Last quarter, I shared how we are investing in product-led growth and self-serve capabilities in order to drive more go-to-market efficiency and deliver a better experience for our customers. This is one of our most important areas of investment as we evolve how DocuSign goes to market and further integrate our digital, direct and partner selling motions. Our digital business had stronger relative performance in Q1 as we launched a number of improvements on our website and within our product experience. These changes were designed to grow traffic, improve conversion rates and drive monetization, and it's just the beginning. Whether it's a small business or a large enterprise, our vision is to make it easy for every type of customer to buy and consume our products in any way they prefer, self-serve, through our direct sales teams or through a partner. Turning to our go-to-market execution in the first quarter. We're pleased with how our field team navigated the distractions in Q1 as we rebalanced our approach. However, we are seeing more moderate pipeline and cautious customer behavior, coupled with smaller deal sizes and lower volumes. We recognize it's a dynamic competitive environment across multiple categories. We're confident in our premium positioning, especially in complex and high-value use cases. As we've stated, international expansion remains a largely untapped opportunity for us. We're making investments not only with market-specific product innovation like identity verification, but also in stronger local market presence to strengthen our footprint. We recently released funding to further invest in Germany and Japan. And in Japan, note, we just went live with our first CLM customer this past quarter. Further supporting our focus on the international expansion, I'm pleased to share that Anna Marrs, Group President of Global Commercial Services and Credit & Fraud Risk at American Express, has joined our Board of Directors and as a member of the Audit Committee. She is a fantastic operating executive with deep global experience and will be a great asset to the Board and the leadership team. Finally, I am thrilled with the key hires we've announced to round out our leadership team. Most notably, Blake Grayson will be joining as DocuSign's new CFO next week. Blake's considerable track record and experience in finance leadership roles in category-leading public companies, including Amazon and The Trade Desk, make him a very strong addition to the DocuSign leadership team. I'd also like to take this opportunity to once again thank, you, Cynthia, for her tremendous contributions to DocuSign as both a Board member and as our CFO for the last four-and-a-half years. I'm grateful for her partnership and strategic leadership as the company navigated immense change. In closing, we had a solid start to the year with strong financial results, continued traction on the key pillars of our strategic vision to transform agreement workflows and intelligence and in rounding out our leadership team with high-caliber talent. We look forward to continuing to share progress as we execute against our initiatives this year. Now, let me turn the call over to Cynthia to walk through our financial results and outlook.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you, Allan, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We had a solid start to the year, exceeding our top-line and operating margin guidance. We made progress during the quarter against our priority initiatives and demonstrated leverage in our operating model. We remain focused on delivering value for our customers with easy-to-use high ROI products, which in today's macro environment continues to be increasingly important as customers look for ways to drive more efficiency in their businesses. With that, let me turn to our Q1 fiscal '24 results. For the first quarter, total revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $661 million, and subscription revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $639 million. Our international revenue grew 17% year-over-year and reached $168 million for the first quarter, representing 25% of revenue. First quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $675 million. As a reminder, billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of deals and complexion of renewals. The macro environment continues to create uncertainty for our customers, and we're seeing the impact of smaller deal sizes and lower expansion rates across the business as customers scrutinize budgets. Q1 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. We are encouraged by initial signs of improved sales execution across our installed base. We added approximately 45,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.4 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 9,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 220,000, a 21% year-on-year increase. We also saw a 20% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,063 customers. The slight decline quarter-on-quarter was primarily driven by customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. Dollar net retention was 105% for the quarter. We continue to see headwinds impacting our expansion rates coupled with muted customer buying patterns in a tough macro environment as budgets remain under scrutiny and customers optimize existing spend. Looking ahead, we expect the Q2 dollar net retention rate to continue to experience downward pressure. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within insurance and business services, highlighting the importance of our diverse customer base and durability of our model, while we continue to see headwinds across financial services and real estate. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 83% compared with 81% a year ago. First quarter subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income reached $176 million compared with $102 million last year. We delivered a record non-GAAP operating margin of 27% compared to 17% last year. This year-on-year improvement demonstrates our focus on profitability and the leverage in our business model. We remain committed to investing in a disciplined way to transform broader agreement workflows that will drive our top-line over time. As we move through the year and execute against our operating plan, we expect a quarterly decrease in operating margin. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was $150 million compared with $77 million in the first quarter of 2023. The fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 20%. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72. We ended Q1 with 6,586 employees compared to 7,642 the year prior. Operating cash flow in the first quarter grew 19% year-over-year to a record high of $234 million or a 35% margin. This compares with $196 million or 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Q1 collections were at an all-time high, benefiting from seasonality and enhanced automation and operational efficiency. Operating cash flow includes one-time cash expenses of $20 million in Q1 related to the 2024 restructuring plan we announced in February. Free cash flow for the quarter was $215 million or a 32% margin compared to $175 million or 30% in the prior year, a 23% year-on-year increase. We exited Q1 with more than $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Turning to our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 700,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $40 million, which demonstrates our confidence in the durability of our business. As a reminder, we have strong cash flow and an attractive balance sheet that gives us flexibility to optimize our capital structure with a focus on opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to our Q2 and fiscal '24 guidance. While we are pleased with our Q1 financial results, it is still early in the year, and we remain cautious in our outlook, given moderating expansion rates and slowing customer demand, driven by the uncertainty in the current macro environment and continued competition, particularly in more basic e-signature use cases. For the second quarter and fiscal year '24, we anticipate total revenue of $675 million to $679 million in Q2 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year, and $2.713 billion to $2.725 billion for fiscal '24 or a growth of 8% year-on-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $658 million to $662 million in Q2 or growth of 9% year-on-year and $2.64 billion to $2.652 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $646 million to $656 million in Q2 or flat to 1% growth year-over-year, and $2.737 billion to $2.757 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 24% to 25% for Q2 and 22% to 24% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We're pleased with the financial results in Q1, along with the resilience and focus the team has demonstrated as we continue to evolve the business. We maintain a disciplined and focused approach to delivering profitability at scale as we invest for the long term. In closing, I want to thank our amazing team for their commitment to delivering for our customers and partners and driving forward the vision for smarter, easier and trusted agreements. On a personal note, the last four-and-a-half years has been an incredible adventure, helping the company operationalize tremendous growth at scale, while providing a stabilizing force through unprecedented change. I'm looking forward to what comes next and to seeing DocuSign continue to be the innovator of defining how the world agrees. With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Tyler Radke with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nKylie Towbin: Hi. This is Kylie Towbin on for Tyler Radke. First off, Cynthia, just wanted to say congratulations, and thank you for your time, and you'll be missed. And on that note too with Blake starting next week and the additions of Dmitri and Kurt too, would love to hear about sort of all of their biggest areas of initial focus. Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Well, so, Blake will, obviously, step into Cynthia's shoes and take on the CFO responsibilities. So, this will be about executing our operating plan, helping us uncover both top-line and bottom-line opportunities and, in general, executing our strategic roadmap. I think Dmitri will lead our product teams, so reporting to Inhi Cho Suh, President of Product & Technology. He has very deep strong background from a number of different enterprise software companies and he's been a real category creator and innovator. We're thrilled to have attracted him. Obviously, product vision and leadership is incredibly important to our future. So, this is a key hire for us and we're delighted to have Dmitri on board. And Kurt is leading our security organization, which has enormous implications both from a risk and compliance perspective. We have a particular given the nature of our business of managing highly sensitive documents and processes, it's essential that we maintain the trust of our customers. I think we've done a good job of that so far, but I think Kurt will -- it's a critical role with, obviously, responsibility to maintain and further grow that as we delve deeper into agreement workflows.\nKylie Towbin: Great. Thanks. And just one more of maybe for Cynthia. With the 8 point beat on billings this quarter, how did the early renewals trend relative to your expectations? And with the full year raised a little bit less than the beat, is it fair to say that the amount you raised guidance was operational beat and the rest was potentially pull forward? Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, thanks, Kylie, and thanks for the kind words. So, I think we were really pleased with the performance in Q1 and particularly on billings. The beat on billings was mainly due to strengths we saw in on-time renewals, which means the team did a great job executing across our installed base. And so, we saw less on the early renewal front. And so that is factored into the guide. So, I would say that's probably the driving force of what we're seeing. When you think about kind of the push through on the guide, I would say that's really colored by the dynamics we're currently seeing in the business and some of the softness that I talked about in the prepared remarks around expansion rates and some of the other metrics. So, we think the guide is reasonable for what we're seeing, but the Q1 beat was mainly driven by on-time renewals in the installed base.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Sorry, I think I was on mute. My apologies.\nCynthia Gaylor: No worries.\nBrad Sills: Sorry. The question is on...\nCynthia Gaylor: Hey, Brad. How you doing?\nBrad Sills: Good. Great. And good luck, Cynthia. It's been great working with you. I wanted to ask a question around Agreement Cloud. I know it's still early here. But where is the focus there? There are some components that I believe are already -- you're already well positioned for upsell on to the base like eNotary and Analyzer. So, just curious if that's an area of focus increasingly from here. Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So, we are focused on delivering a full suite of workflow tools across the agreement journey, and then an intelligence layer that for -- that can assist really at every stage. I think we've shipped components of that in the past, but I think we're really looking to bring all of that together and fully fill out that suite, if you will. We'll do a lot of that work this year. Some of the releases that you saw in Q1, very much emblematic of that. I'd add to that I think the biggest change in our roadmap beyond that clear focus and articulation on agreement workflow is really the advent of generative AI. We've been working on AI for several years. As you know, we have products like Insights that leverage earlier generations of AI models. But given the enormous change there, that's a fantastic opportunity to really unlock the category. And so, we're investing very heavily there. We released some new products, and we'll release more next week at Momentum, but I'm sure we'll talk more about AI during the call. So, I'll stop there.\nBrad Sills: Sounds exciting. Thank you, Allan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Cynthia, could you just remind us what is it mechanically that causes subscription revenue to decline a little sequentially in Q1 and then returning to some amount of sequential growth in Q2? I know there was an element of -- similar to that last year, but I'm just wondering if there is anything anomalous in Q1, or is that a pattern that would recur seasonally as we get into Q1 of next year?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, Q1, a good observation, it's mainly due to the number of days. There's fewer days in the quarter in Q1. So, this Q1 had a few less days than other quarters. And so, that's the main factor there. I think the revenue per day is up, but the function of days in the quarter impacts that for this particular Q1.\nMark Murphy: Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, how is the behavior if you drill down into the real estate verticals? And if you think about it across residential -- both residential and commercial, is there any sign there that might cause you to think there could be some firming up as -- perhaps as interest rates stabilize or just having better performance in the equity markets? Is there any signaling there that is creating a sense of stability or optimism maybe as you get closer to the second half?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I mean, it's a good question and we're certainly not economists. But I would say in general, in our prepared remarks, we covered this, but they are macro. We are seeing kind of customer sentiment across the base. I think, for DocuSign, we have a diversified customer base, which really helps us in up and down markets. I would say, real estate and pockets of financial services continue to be softer than some of the other verticals like manufacturing or business services, which were stronger. So, I would just say, I don't know that we can prognosticate like what the future holds there, but we do have a diversified customer base that does help insulate our business given the long tail there. But real estate definitely is continuing to show softness along with other sectors or sub-sectors that have interest rates or mortgage exposure in this environment.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Thank you. And congrats on the nice execution in Q1.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Allan, just following up on the overall environment, I mean, would you characterize what you're seeing now is pretty consistent with what you saw last quarter? Or if things stabilized, maybe improved a little bit? Just trying to understand the shape of what you've seen quarter-over-quarter.\nAllan Thygesen: I think the macro environment is relatively consistent. And, yes, we, I would say, digging in a little deeper. If you look at it, let's start with segments, maybe slightly better performance in the SMB segment than in the enterprise segment. I think part of that is larger companies just tend to be more immediately sensitive to the business cycle. They also have centralized purchasing departments and other ways of, I should say, tightening spending in a very directed way. So that subtle change, let's say, maybe slightly more pronounced this quarter than previous quarter. We continue to grow faster internationally than domestically, but I don't think that that's a material change. And from a vertical perspective, as Cynthia mentioned, some strength, but I think those are much the same sectors that we're doing a little better last time and parts of financial services, obviously, a little bit more challenged. But by no means all, by the way. So it's localized, let's say, a real estate and a few other things. So overall, it's a pretty balanced picture. I wouldn't say there were major changes in our environment. We are, of course, hoping to induce more change in the environment for our product roadmap. And we're excited with the new releases that we had and you'll see a very rapid pace of new releases over the next few quarters. And so, you have to disrupt that beyond the macro.\nBrent Thill: Great. And just a quick follow-up for Cynthia. 27% margin in the quarter, yet you're guiding 23% for the year. Why such a big step down throughout the year?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, I mean, we outperformed margins by quite a bit in Q1. And I think it really does demonstrate what we've been talking about for a while now, which is leveraging our business model. It's amazing when you don't spend money, you can make a lot of money. But that being said, we're focused on profitability, but also executing on the investments in a disciplined way and I think you kind of saw that in Q1. However, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our expectation is to continue to invest as we move through the year. We got a little bit slower start as we kind of evaluated coming into the year to that spend, but we expect to kind of catch up, and so when you get to the end of the year, by quarter, the margin should go down by quarter, which is implied in our guide. But then also the run rate and [bow wave] (ph) going into next year, like, we'll be fully invested against that. So that's the -- that's our process. But we'll be disciplined. We're still in the long-term target range, and we're raising the year by 1 point relative to where we were 90 days ago. So, we're really pleased with that, but we will invest for the long-term opportunity.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on good execution in the quarter. Maybe just the first one, Allan, you kind of teased on wanting to talk a little bit more about AI. So, I'll kind of zoom out a little bit and just ask, if you think about the priority list for the company to reinvigorate the growth engine, stack rank in your mind, like is it new products? Is it AI monetization? Is it the PLV opening up kind of the umbrella? Like, stack rank, if you would, your strategic thought process on how to kind of reaccelerate growth for the business? And then, I've just got a quick follow-up.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think these things all impact us in different timeframes, right? So, I think we -- overall, I would say, product innovation is going to be the biggest driver and unlocker of our medium- to long-term growth. We do believe that we have very credible low-hanging fruit from better execution on our self-serve and product-led growth motion, and so that's a top priority to drive greater efficiency in the near to medium term. I think the AI impact is perhaps the biggest in the long term. And we are starting to ship products, as I alluded to, and we'll announce more next week. But in terms of its overall impact on the business, I think it's still behind the other two in the near to medium term. But in terms of the long-term potential of our category of agreement workflow, I think it's a massive unlock and a fantastic opportunity for DocuSign. I think we're exceptionally well positioned. So, maybe one other comment about that, if you think about the -- lots of companies talk about AI. And there are commercial AI models available at the consumer level and so really any enterprise will pay the fee. We believe that our opportunity is both category specifically just lends itself to AI, and we -- at every stage. But then if you look at DocuSign, we have deep experience built over multiple years of building agreement-specific models. It's not the same as drafting a high school essay. And we have a deep expertise and the level of accuracy that's required there. We also have the largest data set of agreements of any company, I think, on earth, which puts us in a position to help our clients extract more value out of AI models. And then, lastly, we are, of course, executing very deliberately and intentionally on partnerships with the leading cloud vendors and taking full advantage of the innovation that they're powering. So -- to our work with Microsoft, and we are, of course, talking to the others as well. So...\nAlex Zukin: Super clear answer and very interesting. Maybe just as a follow-up. Cynthia, it's a bit unusual to hear about outperformance on billings driven by in-line renewal trends. We've heard it before on early renewals, but it implies that a year ago, your renewal trends were either below seasonal average or that your guidance was kind of [intenting] (ph) on below plan renewal. So maybe can you just help us understand how do you set that plan? And for the rest of the year, are you assuming that renewals come in at the rate they came in, in Q1, or are you assuming a bit worse? Just help us kind of understand that dynamic for the rest of the year.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, thanks for the question. It is a good one, and I agree with you, it is a bit unusual. But I think the dynamic is for software companies, with subscription models, you have a certain level of on-time renewals, early renewals, late renewals, there're spill in and spill over every quarter, and we model it out pretty granularly. And so, I think what we saw in Q1 is the dynamic of two things with on-time renewals, which means renewals that don't fall into the grace period and spill over to the following quarter. So, our rate of renewal is consistent, and so it's really a timing of deals. And those deals for on-time renewals more landed in Q1, which means in Q2, the implication is there's less spill over into Q2. So that is now baked into the guide. We think it's attributable to two things. One is execution by the team that focuses on the installed base, better execution and kind of closing what's in front of them, which is great. And we're really pleased with that. And then, I think the other is, there is a macro dynamic of less early renewals. So, customers are really scrutinizing their budgets. And when you look at kind of things like expansion rates and deal sizes and volumes, those are coming down. And so again, that's all baked into the guidance, but I would look at the outperformance on billings in Q1 at the timing piece. And again, it's baked into our full year guide, and that's why you're seeing kind of partial push through relative to other options there.\nAlex Zukin: Understood. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I would just add to that, that we were very intentional, obviously, about encouraging our teams to focus on renewals and on consumption within our existing contracts. And so, I just want to echo what Cynthia said that we made some adjustments there in terms of our -- with our organization and our incentive models, and I think that was helpful as well. So, kudos to Steve and his team.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes, thank you very much. Allan, can you talk about the potential for the company to become a double-digit revenue growth company again? I note that the guidance for billings this year embeds around 3% to 4% growth, which is less than half of your revenue growth expected this year. So, I think in response to Alex's question, you talked about product innovation, self-service, like near-term growth drivers and AI longer term, it could be the biggest. So, I'm just wondering if things gel with AI in, I don't know, a few years from now, just talk about the potential for the revenue growth to be double digits again.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Well, so just to go back in time, I think '23 was a year of change for DocuSign -- fiscal '23 last year was a lot of change. As I said on previous earnings call, this year is really about setting the foundation for growth. And that is still true, and we're starting to really make good progress, I think, on that foundation. We are very excited about the long-term potential, and we are reshaping the company to deliver on that. But that kind of transformation is not achieved overnight. So, we're not changing our guidance beyond what we're providing guidance for next year at this time. But I'd say all the early signs in terms of our initiatives in product innovation, self-serve, as you mentioned, the growth of the partner channel and operational efficiency, I think all of those will contribute to that. But we believe we have a very strong opportunity and that AI could be an incremental unlock beyond the core momentum in the business. So, more to come when we're ready to share next year targets later in the year.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. As a follow-up, the product revenue or innovation that you alluded to, is that referring to the three new releases, the Web Forms, highly regulated markets and ID? Or -- and add some additional products perhaps later this year? Just elaborate on what you mean by the product innovation.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think overall, my goal has been to dramatically improve our pace of innovation and pace of product releases. And so, I think we did a good job of that in Q1, and there's more to come here in Q2. In fact, we'll share some parts of our Q2 releases next week at our user conference. So, I look at that at every quarter, you'll see pretty meaningful new functionality across our vision of delivering agreement workflow. Some of the things that I'm most excited about that we intend to deliver this fiscal year, but a little further out, include things like searching across your repository of agreements. As you can imagine, an incredibly important functionality. No one really delivers that today. I think we're planning to do that before the end of the year. Another example of something more evocative and enabling future growth of the categories, we call orchestration, which basically enables you to pick components of the DocuSign suite and any third-party app that we interface with and combine them in ways that are custom for your organization and workflow. We've had a lot of increase for that over the years. No one has ever delivered that in the agreement space, and we intend to do that. So those are examples of things that are more evocative and could unlock the full potential of the category.\nShebly Seyrafi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Great, and thanks for taking my question. I think building on Brent's question a little earlier, I just wanted to better understand the pace of spend as we move throughout the year, because I guess 90 days ago, you had an operating margin that was at the low end, ramping throughout the year, and now, the inverse is happening where you have the high watermark in Q1 and incremental spend. So, just trying to understand, was there a change relative to spend trying to accelerate incremental products or what's going on from that perspective?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I think in Q1, I mean, again, it's a good observation. I think in Q1, we saw lower spend across categories. So, we just got a slower start to the year. So part of it was across the investment areas and the key priorities and higher net new hiring kind of got off to a slower start. However, we expect that to kind of ramp as we move through the year. So we'd expect Q1 to be the high watermark, Q2 to come down slightly, and then Q3 and Q4 to moderate in the low 20s would be what we would expect. And so the year will come up 1 point, but the overall spend, again, in the run rate and the bow wave will be in line with our expectation coming into the year across the AOP.\nRob Owens: And I guess, secondarily, could you talk about pricing and what you're seeing in the more tradition e-signature market throughout the various lenses, I guess, of where you're at in SMB and what enterprise looks like? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean what I would say overall is -- I mean there's no question that compared to three, four years ago, category is more competitive, especially in basic use cases. And so the overall market softens. That said, our win rates are relatively stable. We are -- remained a clear market leader. I think everybody else prices off us. We have, I think, a very strong value proposition in the resulting premium. I mean, customers value the convenience and trust that we have, the higher signed rates, the higher -- the faster time to sign as well as a variety of enterprise-grade capabilities, integrations, security, privacy, et cetera. So, I'd say the price environment continues to be highly competitive, and we think we're the market leader, and we try to make sure we're paid for that, but we also don't want to lose business unnecessarily. So, we're trying to be more agile in that regard in larger enterprise deals where there may be a blend of both. Over time, as we layer in a lot of the functionality I've talked about, we're hopeful that we can bring greater value to our clients. And that will allow us to overall increase our dollar footprint within -- with our enterprise and mid-market customers.\nRob Owens: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Thanks for the question and congrats on a good quarter. One for Allan, one for Cynthia. On CLM and Agreement Cloud, it's clear you're in a strong position to really leverage AI, and you talked about some of the ways that you're going to do that to improve your solutions and add more value. I guess I'm wondering how would you gauge customer interest and timing of that interest? Like, does the opportunity get pushed out at all? Are customers needing to reevaluate CLM in the context of AI and take time? Are there enterprise customers that are thinking about doing it in-house? If you could talk about some of that, like the time to realize the value unlock, or are you seeing near-term momentum?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, that was a lot of questions. I think first thing I'd say is there's definitely strong customer interest in the category and the features and functionality, we see lots of inbound inquiries, we have some of our large SI partners who are making significant investments in their CLM practices. So the overall demand environment, I think, is robust. And I don't think we've really seen any slowdown or hesitation because of AI. If anything, people's expectations have just been raised on what's possible. At the same time, CLM definitely skews more enterprise. It does have longer time to value. It's therefore, more impacted by macro and cautious customer behavior, fuel cycles get longer and so on. So those two things are pulling in opposite direction. Overall, I would say CLM, we believe it has great potential, but it also hasn't quite fulfilled its promise yet, right? It's been too custom, too services heavy, too long time to value. We really want to reimagine the category to be software-first with quick time to value, delightful workflow across all the functions that use it and exceptional out-of-the-box analytics and insights driven by AI. And we are engaging with leading companies across a number of industries. So, we're seeing people reimagine how their legal departments operate, whether it's for risk assessment or compliance or extracting business value. One that I particularly like is we work with a lot of pharma and biotech clients. They use CLM to quickly analyze and assess their corpus of agreements, that allows them to respond to market events, create efficiencies, mitigate risk. They use Insights -- our Insights product to understand the rebate opportunities in their supplier agreements. That's a great example of really extracting business value beyond just being more efficient in how you manage your agreements. So overall, we're very bullish on the category long term. We think it does need to be reimagined and we intend to lead that.\nJosh Baer: Great. Just a real quick one for Cynthia. Professional services revenue, I think, was a record this quarter. Anything to call out for the strength and upside there?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, in that professional services and other category, we do still have some on-prem software that's part of the legacy product suite. And so, there was a Q2 deal that fell into Q1. So again, it's really the timing of deals. And so that was an on-prem deal that led to that upside in the PS and another line.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Thank you, Cynthia. Congrats and good luck.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You talked a lot about the product-led growth initiatives that you started to put in place. But just thinking about the other end of the spectrum with your direct sales motion, now that Steve has been in the seat for a little over a year, are there any new opportunities that he's looking into for that direct motion? I know you talked a little bit about partners international, but you're still kind of in those eight direct field territories internationally. So just curious if there's any updates on the direct side.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean that continues to be the vast majority of our business, and I don't see that changing in a very long time. I think Steve has now the team fully in place. They've all ramped, and just a new level of professionalism and maturity there. And we are working to augment their capabilities in every area. So, whether it's our marketing, our training efforts, our bundling, I think we have opportunities in every area to become a better enterprise sales software company, and Steve is helping us move in that direction. So that is -- continues to be critically important for the company. I think we're making good progress there. And as we ship more product, we have, I think, a sales channel that's very ready and able to capitalize on that.\nJake Roberge: Great. And then just digging a little deeper into generative AI. Opportunity seems pretty interesting with your agreement models and then just the ability to better utilize all the data within your contracts. I'm curious how you're thinking about maybe your monetization plans for the tech. And then, I know it's still early days, but is that something that could start showing up early next year or is that still too early there?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. As I alluded to earlier, I do think relative to just execution on our agreement workflow roadmap and PLG, it's a little further out in terms of impact. In terms of monetization, I expect AI features to be both bundled as part of our baseline products, strengthening their functionality and value, as I suggested earlier. And in some cases, packaged as a separately charged add-on. We do both today. So if you take our Insights product, which is really our AI-driven analytics product for CLM, we both have a stand-alone SKU. It's sold separately as well as a premium bundle. I think we're going to need to learn a little bit more about how customers want to use this and what the key value drivers are before we finalize how we price the different features, but certainly mindful of wanting to capture the -- deliver the most value and capture the most value for DocuSign as we price it.\nJake Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, thanks. Appreciate you fitting me in. Just one for me, maybe on expansion rates. We're hearing some software companies started to comment around when they'll hit a 12-month period and start to lap some of those impacts. Is there any sense you have at this point in time around where or when the expansion headwinds start to settle, assuming we remain in a similar environment? And our gross retention rates, I know you had a comment last quarter on those, are those still holding consistent here? Just any additional context is helpful. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, for sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. So I think expansion rates -- our dollar net retention rate came in at 105%. And for Q2, we'd expect that to continue to come down. Overall across the business, when you look at the different metrics, pressure on expansion rates is the largest contributor to the pressure we're seeing on the top line metrics. And so, we would expect that to continue just based on what we're seeing and what we're expecting in Q2 on dollar net retention. And again, that has been really attributable, if you think about why is it compressing things around customer buying behaviors, scrutinizing budgets more generally, some of the tea leaves around the macro factors. You have to remember, we're a land-and-expand model. And so, within that, as companies land, the rate of them expanding is coming down, and you see that even this quarter in some of the customer metrics. So I think those few -- those handful of things are really driving kind of that expansion rate. And you see it more backward looking in dollar net retention, but you see it in some of the other metrics on a real-time basis as we move through the quarters.\nMichael Turrin: And then, gross retention rates, I know you mentioned partial churn. Are gross retention rates consistent still?\nCynthia Gaylor: We don't disclose gross retention, but I think when we look at various things like the expansion rates -- and we do internally look at churn rates, expansion rate is really driving kind of the compression that we're seeing more than -- and then some of the other pieces.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks, Cynthia. Best of luck to you. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Allan, maybe can you expand a little bit on what you're seeing in international markets and how you're leveraging partners and ecosystem expansion there?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean, overall, I think we're seeing some softness, right, across the business. International is not an exception, but on a relative basis, I think it's a less meaningful factor. It is growing faster than our domestic business. It is the largest part of our addressable market, and we're still only 25% of our revenue. So, we have a huge untapped opportunity. Most of the international markets are at an earlier adoption phase. I think a lot of that is due to regulatory history and cultural habits, but we see that really starting to change now. And so, it's one of the reasons that give us confidence to invest. As I mentioned, we're particularly beyond the major English-speaking markets and a few existing large European markets like France. We're really investing in Japan and Germany to fully capture the opportunity there. Beyond the investment in our direct sales and back-office functions in those markets. Self-service and partners, as you alluded to, are key levers. So that includes partnerships with SIs, met several in my international travels, distributors, et cetera, and of course, our self-service capabilities are particularly suitable for reaching a lot of markets where we can't put a lot of resources on the ground. And then, we're investing heavily on the product side. I mentioned the ID verification. We're qualified, trust, service provider in the EU. And we have a dedicated team and a pretty strong in-market customer relations on that front. So, overall, I'm very bullish on international opportunity. And I think the entire company is excited that we're aligned and investing. We are being quite disciplined with which markets we're adding, should we say, direct sales efforts into and the rest will be partner and self-service enabled.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Okay. And just a follow-up on, you mentioned the EHR Interoperability in your opening remarks. What are you seeing in healthcare right now?\nAllan Thygesen: So, it's one of -- I think it's one of our bigger opportunities from a vertical perspective. We're seeing everything from insurers to hospital chains to chains of doctors' offices adopting signature and forms-based solutions to a patient log-in and registration disclosure. And so, I think really low-hanging fruit is still early days in the digitalization of healthcare system and I think we can play a really meaningful role in that. We're seeing a lot of inbound interest in that. But it's a highly regulated area. So the bar is higher to participate. I think the good news is I think we're in the front of the market there, and that will be -- it's a positive competitive dynamic for us as well.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Jackson Ader with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nKyle Diehl: Great. Thanks for sneaking us in. This is Kyle Diehl on for Jackson. Just a quick one. I think, Cynthia, you might have alluded to it, but as we're thinking about investment in the back half of the year, are those -- is that kind of higher velocity that can be adjusted as you go, or are those investments -- talking about [what's flowing] (ph) down on the operating margins, is that longer-term strategic more so in the year? Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I would say, I mean, we evaluate as we move through the year, but the intention right now is to invest into the plan that we had coming into the year. It just got off to a slower start. So I'd expect the expense to be higher in the back half of the year. Again, we're really pleased to be able to increase the margin for the year by 1 point, but the bow wave and the run rate, we would expect to be about the same. But I'm sure the team will evaluate it as we move that pace. There are pieces around headcount as we hire people that will naturally bring down the margin, because that's by far our biggest expense category. But things like T&E and third-party vendor spend, we're always looking at those areas as well.\nAllan Thygesen: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: That was last question?\nOperator: Yes. I would like to turn the floor back over to Allan for closing comments.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining today's call. We appreciate your support as we continue to make progress towards our long-term vision for the business. In closing, I think we delivered a solid start to the year, and we remain focused on our execution to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. I do want to reiterate my enthusiasm for our product roadmap as we are confident that our investment in innovation and talent will be key moving forward. If you want to continue to see some of the progress we're making, I encourage you to watch our one-hour keynote at Momentum Wednesday next week as we share more updates on our visions and our products. I also look forward to sharing more with you throughout the year. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cynthia Gaylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Allan, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We had a solid start to the year, exceeding our top-line and operating margin guidance. We made progress during the quarter against our priority initiatives and demonstrated leverage in our operating model. We remain focused on delivering value for our customers with easy-to-use high ROI products, which in today's macro environment continues to be increasingly important as customers look for ways to drive more efficiency in their businesses. With that, let me turn to our Q1 fiscal '24 results. For the first quarter, total revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $661 million, and subscription revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $639 million. Our international revenue grew 17% year-over-year and reached $168 million for the first quarter, representing 25% of revenue. First quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $675 million. As a reminder, billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of deals and complexion of renewals. The macro environment continues to create uncertainty for our customers, and we're seeing the impact of smaller deal sizes and lower expansion rates across the business as customers scrutinize budgets. Q1 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. We are encouraged by initial signs of improved sales execution across our installed base. We added approximately 45,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.4 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 9,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 220,000, a 21% year-on-year increase. We also saw a 20% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,063 customers. The slight decline quarter-on-quarter was primarily driven by customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. Dollar net retention was 105% for the quarter. We continue to see headwinds impacting our expansion rates coupled with muted customer buying patterns in a tough macro environment as budgets remain under scrutiny and customers optimize existing spend. Looking ahead, we expect the Q2 dollar net retention rate to continue to experience downward pressure. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within insurance and business services, highlighting the importance of our diverse customer base and durability of our model, while we continue to see headwinds across financial services and real estate. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 83% compared with 81% a year ago. First quarter subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income reached $176 million compared with $102 million last year. We delivered a record non-GAAP operating margin of 27% compared to 17% last year. This year-on-year improvement demonstrates our focus on profitability and the leverage in our business model. We remain committed to investing in a disciplined way to transform broader agreement workflows that will drive our top-line over time. As we move through the year and execute against our operating plan, we expect a quarterly decrease in operating margin. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was $150 million compared with $77 million in the first quarter of 2023. The fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 20%. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72. We ended Q1 with 6,586 employees compared to 7,642 the year prior. Operating cash flow in the first quarter grew 19% year-over-year to a record high of $234 million or a 35% margin. This compares with $196 million or 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Q1 collections were at an all-time high, benefiting from seasonality and enhanced automation and operational efficiency. Operating cash flow includes one-time cash expenses of $20 million in Q1 related to the 2024 restructuring plan we announced in February. Free cash flow for the quarter was $215 million or a 32% margin compared to $175 million or 30% in the prior year, a 23% year-on-year increase. We exited Q1 with more than $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Turning to our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 700,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $40 million, which demonstrates our confidence in the durability of our business. As a reminder, we have strong cash flow and an attractive balance sheet that gives us flexibility to optimize our capital structure with a focus on opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to our Q2 and fiscal '24 guidance. While we are pleased with our Q1 financial results, it is still early in the year, and we remain cautious in our outlook, given moderating expansion rates and slowing customer demand, driven by the uncertainty in the current macro environment and continued competition, particularly in more basic e-signature use cases. For the second quarter and fiscal year '24, we anticipate total revenue of $675 million to $679 million in Q2 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year, and $2.713 billion to $2.725 billion for fiscal '24 or a growth of 8% year-on-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $658 million to $662 million in Q2 or growth of 9% year-on-year and $2.64 billion to $2.652 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $646 million to $656 million in Q2 or flat to 1% growth year-over-year, and $2.737 billion to $2.757 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 24% to 25% for Q2 and 22% to 24% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We're pleased with the financial results in Q1, along with the resilience and focus the team has demonstrated as we continue to evolve the business. We maintain a disciplined and focused approach to delivering profitability at scale as we invest for the long term. In closing, I want to thank our amazing team for their commitment to delivering for our customers and partners and driving forward the vision for smarter, easier and trusted agreements. On a personal note, the last four-and-a-half years has been an incredible adventure, helping the company operationalize tremendous growth at scale, while providing a stabilizing force through unprecedented change. I'm looking forward to what comes next and to seeing DocuSign continue to be the innovator of defining how the world agrees. With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator? Yes, thanks, Kylie, and thanks for the kind words. So, I think we were really pleased with the performance in Q1 and particularly on billings. The beat on billings was mainly due to strengths we saw in on-time renewals, which means the team did a great job executing across our installed base. And so, we saw less on the early renewal front. And so that is factored into the guide. So, I would say that's probably the driving force of what we're seeing. When you think about kind of the push through on the guide, I would say that's really colored by the dynamics we're currently seeing in the business and some of the softness that I talked about in the prepared remarks around expansion rates and some of the other metrics. So, we think the guide is reasonable for what we're seeing, but the Q1 beat was mainly driven by on-time renewals in the installed base. No worries. Hey, Brad. How you doing? Yes. So, Q1, a good observation, it's mainly due to the number of days. There's fewer days in the quarter in Q1. So, this Q1 had a few less days than other quarters. And so, that's the main factor there. I think the revenue per day is up, but the function of days in the quarter impacts that for this particular Q1. Yes. I mean, it's a good question and we're certainly not economists. But I would say in general, in our prepared remarks, we covered this, but they are macro. We are seeing kind of customer sentiment across the base. I think, for DocuSign, we have a diversified customer base, which really helps us in up and down markets. I would say, real estate and pockets of financial services continue to be softer than some of the other verticals like manufacturing or business services, which were stronger. So, I would just say, I don't know that we can prognosticate like what the future holds there, but we do have a diversified customer base that does help insulate our business given the long tail there. But real estate definitely is continuing to show softness along with other sectors or sub-sectors that have interest rates or mortgage exposure in this environment. Thank you. Yes. So, I mean, we outperformed margins by quite a bit in Q1. And I think it really does demonstrate what we've been talking about for a while now, which is leveraging our business model. It's amazing when you don't spend money, you can make a lot of money. But that being said, we're focused on profitability, but also executing on the investments in a disciplined way and I think you kind of saw that in Q1. However, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our expectation is to continue to invest as we move through the year. We got a little bit slower start as we kind of evaluated coming into the year to that spend, but we expect to kind of catch up, and so when you get to the end of the year, by quarter, the margin should go down by quarter, which is implied in our guide. But then also the run rate and [bow wave] (ph) going into next year, like, we'll be fully invested against that. So that's the -- that's our process. But we'll be disciplined. We're still in the long-term target range, and we're raising the year by 1 point relative to where we were 90 days ago. So, we're really pleased with that, but we will invest for the long-term opportunity. Yes, thanks for the question. It is a good one, and I agree with you, it is a bit unusual. But I think the dynamic is for software companies, with subscription models, you have a certain level of on-time renewals, early renewals, late renewals, there're spill in and spill over every quarter, and we model it out pretty granularly. And so, I think what we saw in Q1 is the dynamic of two things with on-time renewals, which means renewals that don't fall into the grace period and spill over to the following quarter. So, our rate of renewal is consistent, and so it's really a timing of deals. And those deals for on-time renewals more landed in Q1, which means in Q2, the implication is there's less spill over into Q2. So that is now baked into the guide. We think it's attributable to two things. One is execution by the team that focuses on the installed base, better execution and kind of closing what's in front of them, which is great. And we're really pleased with that. And then, I think the other is, there is a macro dynamic of less early renewals. So, customers are really scrutinizing their budgets. And when you look at kind of things like expansion rates and deal sizes and volumes, those are coming down. And so again, that's all baked into the guidance, but I would look at the outperformance on billings in Q1 at the timing piece. And again, it's baked into our full year guide, and that's why you're seeing kind of partial push through relative to other options there. Yes. I think in Q1, I mean, again, it's a good observation. I think in Q1, we saw lower spend across categories. So, we just got a slower start to the year. So part of it was across the investment areas and the key priorities and higher net new hiring kind of got off to a slower start. However, we expect that to kind of ramp as we move through the year. So we'd expect Q1 to be the high watermark, Q2 to come down slightly, and then Q3 and Q4 to moderate in the low 20s would be what we would expect. And so the year will come up 1 point, but the overall spend, again, in the run rate and the bow wave will be in line with our expectation coming into the year across the AOP. Yes. So, in that professional services and other category, we do still have some on-prem software that's part of the legacy product suite. And so, there was a Q2 deal that fell into Q1. So again, it's really the timing of deals. And so that was an on-prem deal that led to that upside in the PS and another line. Thank you, Josh. Yes, for sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. So I think expansion rates -- our dollar net retention rate came in at 105%. And for Q2, we'd expect that to continue to come down. Overall across the business, when you look at the different metrics, pressure on expansion rates is the largest contributor to the pressure we're seeing on the top line metrics. And so, we would expect that to continue just based on what we're seeing and what we're expecting in Q2 on dollar net retention. And again, that has been really attributable, if you think about why is it compressing things around customer buying behaviors, scrutinizing budgets more generally, some of the tea leaves around the macro factors. You have to remember, we're a land-and-expand model. And so, within that, as companies land, the rate of them expanding is coming down, and you see that even this quarter in some of the customer metrics. So I think those few -- those handful of things are really driving kind of that expansion rate. And you see it more backward looking in dollar net retention, but you see it in some of the other metrics on a real-time basis as we move through the quarters. We don't disclose gross retention, but I think when we look at various things like the expansion rates -- and we do internally look at churn rates, expansion rate is really driving kind of the compression that we're seeing more than -- and then some of the other pieces. Thank you. Yes. I would say, I mean, we evaluate as we move through the year, but the intention right now is to invest into the plan that we had coming into the year. It just got off to a slower start. So I'd expect the expense to be higher in the back half of the year. Again, we're really pleased to be able to increase the margin for the year by 1 point, but the bow wave and the run rate, we would expect to be about the same. But I'm sure the team will evaluate it as we move that pace. There are pieces around headcount as we hire people that will naturally bring down the margin, because that's by far our biggest expense category. But things like T&E and third-party vendor spend, we're always looking at those areas as well."

            "name": "Allan Thygesen",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered a solid start to the fiscal year, reporting financial metrics that exceeded our guidance. We announced new product innovations to enable smarter, easier, trusted agreement workflows. First, some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q1 total revenue came in at $661 million, up 12% versus prior year. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin came in at a healthy 27%, driven by our continued focus on profitability and efficiency. We're pleased with the early traction we're making against our objectives. However, we do continue to operate in a challenging macro environment with cautious customer sentiment, evident in moderating expansion rates. Last quarter, I shared our plans to accelerate our product release cycles in fiscal 2024. What you'll see is that our roadmap builds on DocuSign's strength as the world's leading e-signature company while also moving us towards enabling the entire agreement journey with intelligent workflows. We're deepening these capabilities to deliver more strategic value to our customers. With that, let me touch on three new releases that shipped this quarter. First, as mentioned on the Q4 call, DocuSign Web Forms launched in April. In the first few weeks since launch, we're seeing strong traction for Web Forms across verticals, including financial services, real estate, healthcare and life sciences, leveraging our differentiated approach to streamlining how agreements are generated. Web Forms are simple and powerful for both senders and signers. They're easy to use and customers benefit from the ability to more easily capture and leverage data from their agreements. Next, we made strong progress penetrating and innovating in highly regulated markets. One example is our work in the healthcare vertical, which is undergoing dramatic digital transformation. We're proud that our e-signature product can now seamlessly connect to electronic health records in the U.S. market, including from Epic and Cerner in accordance with industry standards. This will modernize the patient experience and improve efficiency for healthcare companies, while also deepening DocuSign's presence within the vertical. And finally, we introduced DocuSign ID Verification Premier, our tier of ID solutions which meet the highest levels of trust, security and compliance. Our first offering within this tier is ID verification for EU Qualified e-signature. By combining verification of an ID with confirmation of the presence of the person on the ID, it fully replaces face-to-face verifications and a handwritten signature under EU law. We look forward to leveraging this powerful offering as we expand our business in Europe. More broadly, our strategy is to partner closely with leading identity services companies to leverage -- to integrate the best breed solutions into our platform. Looking ahead, I'd like to share our vision and thinking on generative AI. In brief, we believe AI unlocks the true potential of the intelligent agreement category. We already have a strong track record, leveraging sophisticated AI models, having built and shipped solutions based on earlier generations of AI. Generative AI can transform all aspects of agreement workflow, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. As an early example, we recently introduced a new limited availability feature Agreement Summarization. This new feature, which is enabled by our integration with Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and tuned with our own proprietary agreement model, uses AI to summarize and documents critical components, giving signers a clear grasp of the most relevant information within their agreement while respecting data security and privacy. Future launches will include search across customer agreement libraries, extractions from agreements and proposed language and edits based on customer, industry and universal best practices. DocuSign is a trusted partner to leading companies across many industries. As the leader in agreement workflows, we can use AI to deliver important value to customers by leveraging the world's largest set of agreement data, our proprietary agreement models and deep integrations with best-in-class third-party models. We're excited to showcase new products and enhancements at our -- on our intelligent agreement roadmap, including significant AI-powered innovations at our user conference Momentum. The event will kick off next week in Santa Clara with virtual and in-person events in eight cities around the globe over the next few months. Turning to our initiatives around our omnichannel go-to-market. We are continuing to drive deep relationships within our partner ecosystem and enhancing our AI capabilities. We were honored to be showcased in the main keynote of Microsoft's Build Conference as one of the first companies using Microsoft Azure OpenAI. This further underscores our growing relationship with Microsoft and the opportunities we're seeing to enhance our AI capabilities. During the quarter, we also joined the SAP Endorsed Apps program. E-signature has been rigorously tested and validated by SAP to ensure that it seamlessly integrates with SAP solutions and meets their high standards for quality and performance. We're pleased with the progress we're seeing across our partner ecosystem, which will continue to drive further adoption of our products globally. Last quarter, I shared how we are investing in product-led growth and self-serve capabilities in order to drive more go-to-market efficiency and deliver a better experience for our customers. This is one of our most important areas of investment as we evolve how DocuSign goes to market and further integrate our digital, direct and partner selling motions. Our digital business had stronger relative performance in Q1 as we launched a number of improvements on our website and within our product experience. These changes were designed to grow traffic, improve conversion rates and drive monetization, and it's just the beginning. Whether it's a small business or a large enterprise, our vision is to make it easy for every type of customer to buy and consume our products in any way they prefer, self-serve, through our direct sales teams or through a partner. Turning to our go-to-market execution in the first quarter. We're pleased with how our field team navigated the distractions in Q1 as we rebalanced our approach. However, we are seeing more moderate pipeline and cautious customer behavior, coupled with smaller deal sizes and lower volumes. We recognize it's a dynamic competitive environment across multiple categories. We're confident in our premium positioning, especially in complex and high-value use cases. As we've stated, international expansion remains a largely untapped opportunity for us. We're making investments not only with market-specific product innovation like identity verification, but also in stronger local market presence to strengthen our footprint. We recently released funding to further invest in Germany and Japan. And in Japan, note, we just went live with our first CLM customer this past quarter. Further supporting our focus on the international expansion, I'm pleased to share that Anna Marrs, Group President of Global Commercial Services and Credit & Fraud Risk at American Express, has joined our Board of Directors and as a member of the Audit Committee. She is a fantastic operating executive with deep global experience and will be a great asset to the Board and the leadership team. Finally, I am thrilled with the key hires we've announced to round out our leadership team. Most notably, Blake Grayson will be joining as DocuSign's new CFO next week. Blake's considerable track record and experience in finance leadership roles in category-leading public companies, including Amazon and The Trade Desk, make him a very strong addition to the DocuSign leadership team. I'd also like to take this opportunity to once again thank, you, Cynthia, for her tremendous contributions to DocuSign as both a Board member and as our CFO for the last four-and-a-half years. I'm grateful for her partnership and strategic leadership as the company navigated immense change. In closing, we had a solid start to the year with strong financial results, continued traction on the key pillars of our strategic vision to transform agreement workflows and intelligence and in rounding out our leadership team with high-caliber talent. We look forward to continuing to share progress as we execute against our initiatives this year. Now, let me turn the call over to Cynthia to walk through our financial results and outlook. Yes. Well, so, Blake will, obviously, step into Cynthia's shoes and take on the CFO responsibilities. So, this will be about executing our operating plan, helping us uncover both top-line and bottom-line opportunities and, in general, executing our strategic roadmap. I think Dmitri will lead our product teams, so reporting to Inhi Cho Suh, President of Product & Technology. He has very deep strong background from a number of different enterprise software companies and he's been a real category creator and innovator. We're thrilled to have attracted him. Obviously, product vision and leadership is incredibly important to our future. So, this is a key hire for us and we're delighted to have Dmitri on board. And Kurt is leading our security organization, which has enormous implications both from a risk and compliance perspective. We have a particular given the nature of our business of managing highly sensitive documents and processes, it's essential that we maintain the trust of our customers. I think we've done a good job of that so far, but I think Kurt will -- it's a critical role with, obviously, responsibility to maintain and further grow that as we delve deeper into agreement workflows. Yes. So, we are focused on delivering a full suite of workflow tools across the agreement journey, and then an intelligence layer that for -- that can assist really at every stage. I think we've shipped components of that in the past, but I think we're really looking to bring all of that together and fully fill out that suite, if you will. We'll do a lot of that work this year. Some of the releases that you saw in Q1, very much emblematic of that. I'd add to that I think the biggest change in our roadmap beyond that clear focus and articulation on agreement workflow is really the advent of generative AI. We've been working on AI for several years. As you know, we have products like Insights that leverage earlier generations of AI models. But given the enormous change there, that's a fantastic opportunity to really unlock the category. And so, we're investing very heavily there. We released some new products, and we'll release more next week at Momentum, but I'm sure we'll talk more about AI during the call. So, I'll stop there. I think the macro environment is relatively consistent. And, yes, we, I would say, digging in a little deeper. If you look at it, let's start with segments, maybe slightly better performance in the SMB segment than in the enterprise segment. I think part of that is larger companies just tend to be more immediately sensitive to the business cycle. They also have centralized purchasing departments and other ways of, I should say, tightening spending in a very directed way. So that subtle change, let's say, maybe slightly more pronounced this quarter than previous quarter. We continue to grow faster internationally than domestically, but I don't think that that's a material change. And from a vertical perspective, as Cynthia mentioned, some strength, but I think those are much the same sectors that we're doing a little better last time and parts of financial services, obviously, a little bit more challenged. But by no means all, by the way. So it's localized, let's say, a real estate and a few other things. So overall, it's a pretty balanced picture. I wouldn't say there were major changes in our environment. We are, of course, hoping to induce more change in the environment for our product roadmap. And we're excited with the new releases that we had and you'll see a very rapid pace of new releases over the next few quarters. And so, you have to disrupt that beyond the macro. Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think these things all impact us in different timeframes, right? So, I think we -- overall, I would say, product innovation is going to be the biggest driver and unlocker of our medium- to long-term growth. We do believe that we have very credible low-hanging fruit from better execution on our self-serve and product-led growth motion, and so that's a top priority to drive greater efficiency in the near to medium term. I think the AI impact is perhaps the biggest in the long term. And we are starting to ship products, as I alluded to, and we'll announce more next week. But in terms of its overall impact on the business, I think it's still behind the other two in the near to medium term. But in terms of the long-term potential of our category of agreement workflow, I think it's a massive unlock and a fantastic opportunity for DocuSign. I think we're exceptionally well positioned. So, maybe one other comment about that, if you think about the -- lots of companies talk about AI. And there are commercial AI models available at the consumer level and so really any enterprise will pay the fee. We believe that our opportunity is both category specifically just lends itself to AI, and we -- at every stage. But then if you look at DocuSign, we have deep experience built over multiple years of building agreement-specific models. It's not the same as drafting a high school essay. And we have a deep expertise and the level of accuracy that's required there. We also have the largest data set of agreements of any company, I think, on earth, which puts us in a position to help our clients extract more value out of AI models. And then, lastly, we are, of course, executing very deliberately and intentionally on partnerships with the leading cloud vendors and taking full advantage of the innovation that they're powering. So -- to our work with Microsoft, and we are, of course, talking to the others as well. So... Yes, I would just add to that, that we were very intentional, obviously, about encouraging our teams to focus on renewals and on consumption within our existing contracts. And so, I just want to echo what Cynthia said that we made some adjustments there in terms of our -- with our organization and our incentive models, and I think that was helpful as well. So, kudos to Steve and his team. Yes. Well, so just to go back in time, I think '23 was a year of change for DocuSign -- fiscal '23 last year was a lot of change. As I said on previous earnings call, this year is really about setting the foundation for growth. And that is still true, and we're starting to really make good progress, I think, on that foundation. We are very excited about the long-term potential, and we are reshaping the company to deliver on that. But that kind of transformation is not achieved overnight. So, we're not changing our guidance beyond what we're providing guidance for next year at this time. But I'd say all the early signs in terms of our initiatives in product innovation, self-serve, as you mentioned, the growth of the partner channel and operational efficiency, I think all of those will contribute to that. But we believe we have a very strong opportunity and that AI could be an incremental unlock beyond the core momentum in the business. So, more to come when we're ready to share next year targets later in the year. Yes. I think overall, my goal has been to dramatically improve our pace of innovation and pace of product releases. And so, I think we did a good job of that in Q1, and there's more to come here in Q2. In fact, we'll share some parts of our Q2 releases next week at our user conference. So, I look at that at every quarter, you'll see pretty meaningful new functionality across our vision of delivering agreement workflow. Some of the things that I'm most excited about that we intend to deliver this fiscal year, but a little further out, include things like searching across your repository of agreements. As you can imagine, an incredibly important functionality. No one really delivers that today. I think we're planning to do that before the end of the year. Another example of something more evocative and enabling future growth of the categories, we call orchestration, which basically enables you to pick components of the DocuSign suite and any third-party app that we interface with and combine them in ways that are custom for your organization and workflow. We've had a lot of increase for that over the years. No one has ever delivered that in the agreement space, and we intend to do that. So those are examples of things that are more evocative and could unlock the full potential of the category. Yes. I mean what I would say overall is -- I mean there's no question that compared to three, four years ago, category is more competitive, especially in basic use cases. And so the overall market softens. That said, our win rates are relatively stable. We are -- remained a clear market leader. I think everybody else prices off us. We have, I think, a very strong value proposition in the resulting premium. I mean, customers value the convenience and trust that we have, the higher signed rates, the higher -- the faster time to sign as well as a variety of enterprise-grade capabilities, integrations, security, privacy, et cetera. So, I'd say the price environment continues to be highly competitive, and we think we're the market leader, and we try to make sure we're paid for that, but we also don't want to lose business unnecessarily. So, we're trying to be more agile in that regard in larger enterprise deals where there may be a blend of both. Over time, as we layer in a lot of the functionality I've talked about, we're hopeful that we can bring greater value to our clients. And that will allow us to overall increase our dollar footprint within -- with our enterprise and mid-market customers. Yes, that was a lot of questions. I think first thing I'd say is there's definitely strong customer interest in the category and the features and functionality, we see lots of inbound inquiries, we have some of our large SI partners who are making significant investments in their CLM practices. So the overall demand environment, I think, is robust. And I don't think we've really seen any slowdown or hesitation because of AI. If anything, people's expectations have just been raised on what's possible. At the same time, CLM definitely skews more enterprise. It does have longer time to value. It's therefore, more impacted by macro and cautious customer behavior, fuel cycles get longer and so on. So those two things are pulling in opposite direction. Overall, I would say CLM, we believe it has great potential, but it also hasn't quite fulfilled its promise yet, right? It's been too custom, too services heavy, too long time to value. We really want to reimagine the category to be software-first with quick time to value, delightful workflow across all the functions that use it and exceptional out-of-the-box analytics and insights driven by AI. And we are engaging with leading companies across a number of industries. So, we're seeing people reimagine how their legal departments operate, whether it's for risk assessment or compliance or extracting business value. One that I particularly like is we work with a lot of pharma and biotech clients. They use CLM to quickly analyze and assess their corpus of agreements, that allows them to respond to market events, create efficiencies, mitigate risk. They use Insights -- our Insights product to understand the rebate opportunities in their supplier agreements. That's a great example of really extracting business value beyond just being more efficient in how you manage your agreements. So overall, we're very bullish on the category long term. We think it does need to be reimagined and we intend to lead that. Yes. I mean that continues to be the vast majority of our business, and I don't see that changing in a very long time. I think Steve has now the team fully in place. They've all ramped, and just a new level of professionalism and maturity there. And we are working to augment their capabilities in every area. So, whether it's our marketing, our training efforts, our bundling, I think we have opportunities in every area to become a better enterprise sales software company, and Steve is helping us move in that direction. So that is -- continues to be critically important for the company. I think we're making good progress there. And as we ship more product, we have, I think, a sales channel that's very ready and able to capitalize on that. Yes. As I alluded to earlier, I do think relative to just execution on our agreement workflow roadmap and PLG, it's a little further out in terms of impact. In terms of monetization, I expect AI features to be both bundled as part of our baseline products, strengthening their functionality and value, as I suggested earlier. And in some cases, packaged as a separately charged add-on. We do both today. So if you take our Insights product, which is really our AI-driven analytics product for CLM, we both have a stand-alone SKU. It's sold separately as well as a premium bundle. I think we're going to need to learn a little bit more about how customers want to use this and what the key value drivers are before we finalize how we price the different features, but certainly mindful of wanting to capture the -- deliver the most value and capture the most value for DocuSign as we price it. Yes. I mean, overall, I think we're seeing some softness, right, across the business. International is not an exception, but on a relative basis, I think it's a less meaningful factor. It is growing faster than our domestic business. It is the largest part of our addressable market, and we're still only 25% of our revenue. So, we have a huge untapped opportunity. Most of the international markets are at an earlier adoption phase. I think a lot of that is due to regulatory history and cultural habits, but we see that really starting to change now. And so, it's one of the reasons that give us confidence to invest. As I mentioned, we're particularly beyond the major English-speaking markets and a few existing large European markets like France. We're really investing in Japan and Germany to fully capture the opportunity there. Beyond the investment in our direct sales and back-office functions in those markets. Self-service and partners, as you alluded to, are key levers. So that includes partnerships with SIs, met several in my international travels, distributors, et cetera, and of course, our self-service capabilities are particularly suitable for reaching a lot of markets where we can't put a lot of resources on the ground. And then, we're investing heavily on the product side. I mentioned the ID verification. We're qualified, trust, service provider in the EU. And we have a dedicated team and a pretty strong in-market customer relations on that front. So, overall, I'm very bullish on international opportunity. And I think the entire company is excited that we're aligned and investing. We are being quite disciplined with which markets we're adding, should we say, direct sales efforts into and the rest will be partner and self-service enabled. So, it's one of -- I think it's one of our bigger opportunities from a vertical perspective. We're seeing everything from insurers to hospital chains to chains of doctors' offices adopting signature and forms-based solutions to a patient log-in and registration disclosure. And so, I think really low-hanging fruit is still early days in the digitalization of healthcare system and I think we can play a really meaningful role in that. We're seeing a lot of inbound interest in that. But it's a highly regulated area. So the bar is higher to participate. I think the good news is I think we're in the front of the market there, and that will be -- it's a positive competitive dynamic for us as well. Okay. That was last question? Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining today's call. We appreciate your support as we continue to make progress towards our long-term vision for the business. In closing, I think we delivered a solid start to the year, and we remain focused on our execution to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. I do want to reiterate my enthusiasm for our product roadmap as we are confident that our investment in innovation and talent will be key moving forward. If you want to continue to see some of the progress we're making, I encourage you to watch our one-hour keynote at Momentum Wednesday next week as we share more updates on our visions and our products. I also look forward to sharing more with you throughout the year. Thank you very much."
